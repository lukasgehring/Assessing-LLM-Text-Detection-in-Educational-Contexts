0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.; It has been the subject of much discussion between parents and educators. While some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for future success, I am firmly convinced that teaching children to co-operate is more useful in making them useful adults. By teaching children to co-operate, they develop the social skills of communication, understanding, co-operation, and problem-solving. Cooperation also develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is the basis for building long-lasting and harmonious relationships. When children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, and to work together more harmoniously and efficiently. Furthermore, teaching children to compete may result in unhealthy individualism, making them seek their own success above all else. It can also make them lose their self-esteem and self-confidence when they fail. Children who are taught to co-operate, share their ideas, and support each other, grow up to be more mature, friendly, and helpful. When they enter the complicated society of the future, they will be able to work with others and build long-lasting and healthy relationships, and contribute to the public's interests. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its own benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more useful in the long run. Children must be taught to co-operate so that they grow up to be compassionate, co-operative, and successful.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.; You should also indicate the reasons for your opinion and give your own opinion. It has been argued that children should be taught to compete with each other, while others argue that they should learn to work together to help each other, as this would give them essential social skills such as communication, cooperation, empathy and problem-solving. Besides, co-operation is the foundation of the sense of community and mutual respect that helps build strong and lasting relationships. When children learn to work together to achieve a common goal, they can see how each person contributes to the group, which leads to a more harmonious and productive group. This would also be good preparation for the working world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Children who are over-exposed to competition are more likely to develop a strong sense of individuality, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an over-stressed, anxious and unhealthy obsession with winning, which could be very detrimental to their self-esteem and happiness. By learning to work together, share ideas and support each other, children will grow into well-rounded, empathetic, successful and productive adults who can better cope with the complexities of the real world, and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think teaching children to work together is better for their long-term development. It would help to raise a generation of well-rounded, empathetic, successful and productive adults.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.; The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has sparked a heated debate among educators and parents. Although some believe that if we teach our children to compete it will help them to achieve future success, I believe that by teaching children to cooperate we will give them the skills they need to be successful and useful adults. Cooperation also builds a sense of community and mutual respect, both of which are essential for building long-lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to recognize each other’s strengths and weaknesses and this understanding makes for a better and more productive team. In addition, this prepares children for the adult world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation is also more beneficial for children than competition. If we teach children to compete, we are teaching them to be selfish and to focus on personal achievement, and this attitude will lead to frustration and lower self-esteem when they encounter obstacles and setbacks. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to work together and support each other and this helps children to become more empathetic and productive adults who are able to deal with the complexities of life and are able to make a positive contribution to their communities. In conclusion, I think that although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, in the long run, teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial for them. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, productive, and successful adults.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.; A number of teachers and parents are now discussing whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some feel that the competitive attitude is the best way to teach children to become successful adults, I believe that teaching children to cooperate can be more useful in preparing them for life. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which can help to build a solid relationship. In addition, children who learn to work together on a common task, often understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which helps to build strong relationships later in life. Competition, on the other hand, can make children selfish. It can make them want to win at all costs, and when they fail, they may become sad and anxious. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share their ideas and help each other. Cooperation can make them better prepared for the difficulties of the world. In conclusion, while there are benefits to competition, I believe that teaching children to cooperate has more benefits. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is the best way to raise a compassionate and successful generation.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.; Whether it is better to teach children to compete or to co-operate is a subject of heated debate among teachers and parents. Some argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, but I believe that teaching them to co-operate is a more beneficial way of preparing them to be useful members of society. It builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential to building good, lasting relationships. If children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses and a harmonious, more productive team can result. An overly competitive environment can also lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, leading to anxiety and self-esteem problems when a child encounters setbacks. Whereas teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with individual success, which can make children anxious, anxious and depressed when they do not succeed. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other will be more productive and better able to deal with the complexities of the real world and the needs of others. In conclusion, while there are advantages to both teaching children to compete and teach them to co-operate, I believe that a co-operative approach is more beneficial in the long run. For this reason, it is essential that children be taught to co-operate in order to be successful, helpful and kind adults.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.; When it comes to educating children, many educators and parents are deeply divided about whether it is better to educate children to compete or to work together. Whether competition or co-operation is a better way to raise children to be useful adults is a topic of debate among many educationalists and parents. There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods of education. It is said that competition develops in children a sense of competition, while co-operation develops a sense of community, which helps to build stronger relationships. Furthermore, the overemphasis on competition may create a cut-throat atmosphere where children feel a pressure to win at any cost, which may undermine the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, the education of children to compete may result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing anxiety, depression and lowered self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. In conclusion, while there are benefits to both the competition and co-operation of children, I believe that education of children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. In this way, they can work better as a team and contribute more to the community. Therefore, the education of children to work together is the best way to raise a generation of more compassionate, co-operative and successful people.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole."; Cooperation or competition has long been a controversial topic in education, where many parents and teachers are divided. While some argue that cooperation is essential for success in the future, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is the most beneficial way to make them useful adults. Cooperation is the foundation for building a cohesive and peaceful society. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they will learn to recognize and respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, and their collaboration will be the foundation for them to become a cooperative and responsible adult. In contrast, competition can create an environment where children feel compelled to win at all costs, causing them to lose respect for fair play and sportsmanship. Competition can also lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, resulting in anxiety, depression and self-esteem. Cooperation makes children more rounded and empathetic, which will help them to better deal with the complexities of real life. When they grow up, they will be better able to establish strong relationships with others, work well in a team, and make positive contributions to society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will benefit them in the long run. Cooperation will help to raise a compassionate, cooperative, and successful generation.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future."; Children’s education for future life is of great importance. There are many ideas about teaching them to compete or cooperate. Cooperation is the best policy because it develops a sense of community and mutual respect that is necessary for the development of the people and the state. Cooperation prepares children for a world in which a sense of unity and a sense of working together are valued. Competition creates a selfish, competitive, and aggressive environment in which the only goal is to win, and the concept of fair play and equality is forgotten. Competition is a very important, and, in the long run, gives the child a sense of independence and stress, as well as self-esteem, if they do not win, and it is therefore harmful to children to teach them to compete. Cooperation helps children become well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults who know how to build relationships, work together, and be able to work in a group. Cooperation is also more beneficial in the long run. In the end, teaching children to cooperate is the only way to create a generation of people who are empathetic, unified, and successful.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society."; I think that education is a place where a child can learn the qualities of cooperation and respect. Although some educators and parents feel that competition is an essential part of child development, I believe that it is more beneficial to teach children to be cooperative in order to become productive adults. Cooperation can also foster a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong, long-lasting relationships. Children who work together toward a common goal can learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to work more harmoniously and efficiently as a team. Cooperation can also encourage good sportsmanship and fairness. In contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic outlook, where they value their own success above the success of others. This can lead to a unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and a loss of self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. By contrast, children who learn to work together, share ideas, and support one another can develop into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. These adults will be better prepared to deal with the complexities of real life and to create strong, positive relationships with other people and to make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will have more benefits over the long term. Cooperation is essential for fostering a new generation of compassionate, successful, and successful people.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.; . Children can be taught to compete or to work together. Among teachers and parents, there is much debate about which is better. I firmly believe that children should be taught to work together because they learn important social skills such as communication, caring, and problem-solving. Together, children can learn to respect each other and be better friends. When children work together, they learn to recognize their strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a harmonious and efficient team. To teach children to compete makes them too individualistic. It teaches them to think only of themselves. When they fail, they feel remorse and have low self-esteem. Teaching children to work together develops them into cooperative, caring, and hard-working adults. In the complex world in which they live, they are better prepared to work in teams, form strong relationships, and help their communities. Even though I recognize that children learn from competition, I believe that in the long run children benefit more from being taught to work together. In the end, teaching children to work together is necessary to produce a caring, cooperative, and successful generation.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students."; Cooperation or competition is a debate among educators and parents. Some people argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, while others argue that teaching children to cooperate will produce more useful adults. Cooperation, for example, creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important in building long-lasting relationships. When children work together for the same goal, they will appreciate each other's talents and strengths, which will lead to a more cohesive and efficient team. Also, a competition-based education will only lead to a selfish mindset that puts winning above all else, which can lead to a lack of teamwork and fairness. Moreover, a competition-based education will cause children to place unhealthy emphasis on their own achievements and successes, which may lead to depression and low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation teaches children to share, listen, and work together, and by doing so they become more cooperative, empathetic, and productive as adults. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, teaching children to cooperate will benefit them more in the long run. Cooperation, rather than competition, will produce more successful, empathetic, and happy individuals.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.; The issue of whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has always been a matter of heated debate among teachers and parents. While many argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I am convinced that teaching children to cooperate is more important to the development of a useful and productive adult. Cooperation leads to the development of a sense of community and mutual respect, which are critical to the formation of a strong and lasting friendship. Moreover, children who are taught to work together in school learn to appreciate the differences in each other, and to recognize the importance of working as a team. Moreover, it is only through working as a team that children are prepared for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are the keys to success. Furthermore, teaching children to compete fosters an unhealthy obsession with winning, and may result in a lowering of self-esteem when they experience failure. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may result in the development of a selfish and uncaring attitude towards others, and lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, causing a lowering of self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. In my view, it is more beneficial to teach children to work together in school so that they will become more caring, more empathetic and more capable adults, who will be able to handle the complexities of the real world with greater ease, and be better able to work in a team, to achieve common goals and to benefit their community. In conclusion, although competition does have its advantages, I believe that in the long run, teaching children to work together is more beneficial. In my opinion, it is more important to teach children to work together in school, because it is only through working as a team that they are prepared for the complexities of the real world, where teamwork and cooperation are the keys to success.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.; This question has always been controversial among teachers and parents. Some claim that it is important to teach children to compete for future success, while others argue that it is better to teach them to cooperate for future usefulness. I think that children should be taught to work together, and this will help them to develop many social skills: to communicate, to understand, to sympathize, and to solve problems. Moreover, if children work together they will learn to appreciate each other’s skills and weaknesses, which is very useful for a group to function smoothly and produce a good result. Also, in the future they will find it easier to get along with each other. Furthermore, if they are made to compete they will lose their sense of fair play and will be under pressure to win at any cost, which will make them anxious and may lower their self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may make them more selfish and make them more focused on their own success. If they fail, they will be very disappointed in themselves and this may lead to a decrease in self-esteem and lack of confidence. It is therefore my opinion that children should be encouraged to work together rather than compete. If they do, they will be able to work more successfully in groups and get on better with other people. In conclusion, while it is true that children can learn a lot from competition, I think it is better to teach them to work together in order to benefit them in the long run. In my opinion, it is better to teach children to work together than to compete.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?; Opinions about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together have always been very lively in the public sphere. While some people say that learning to compete is the most important for children to be successful in the future, I am sure that if we teach children to work together, they will be more useful and well-developed as adults. Also, cooperation can foster community and mutual respect, which is very important for building strong and lasting relationships. Moreover, children working together can learn to appreciate each other's skills and weaknesses, which can help them work together better in the future. In addition, the focus on competition can lead to a cutthroat attitude, causing children to lose sight of fairness and sportsmanship, and making them feel overwhelmed and anxious when they encounter obstacles. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other will become more mature, empathetic and productive adults. As they enter the real world, they will be better able to build strong relationships, work effectively in groups and serve their communities. In short, although competition also has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. A more cooperative attitude in children is a more important way to raise a generation of people who are compassionate, cooperative and successful.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.; The idea of teaching children to compete or co-operate has aroused heated discussion among educators and parents. Some believe that teaching children to compete is the best way to prepare them for future success. However, I would like to argue that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in preparing them for a life of usefulness as adults. Besides, when children work together, they learn to appreciate the value of the strengths and weaknesses of others, and this prepares them for future work in the world where teamwork is the rule. Furthermore, too much competition can create an unhealthy emphasis on success at all costs, and a lack of fair play and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy emphasis on the success of the individual child and can make him/her too reliant on success, resulting in lower self-esteem and frustration when they fail. When children learn to co-operate, they learn to work together, share ideas and support one another, which makes them more useful, capable, well-rounded and productive adults, who are able to form good relationships with others and contribute to society. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its advantages, I would argue that in the long run teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial to their future lives. When children are taught to co-operate, they are better prepared to live in a world where they must work with others.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits."; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together has a long history among educators and parents. Some educators and parents think that competition is a better way to develop children’s character and success in the future. I think teaching children to work together is more beneficial to children and it would be better for children to learn this in their childhood. In addition, cooperation is necessary to develop community and mutual respect. In the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued, children learn to appreciate the value of cooperation and group work. Besides, too much competition can make children feel a strong pressure to succeed at all costs and it will damage their sense of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an overly individualistic attitude in which they emphasize their own success above all else and become obsessed with winning. Then they will feel a sense of disappointment, stress and anxiety when they meet with failure. In my opinion, teaching children to work together is more beneficial to their future lives. Children who learn to work together, share their ideas and support each other, are more likely to develop into mature, empathetic and successful adults, who are able to deal with the complexities of the real world and have the ability to work well with others, to contribute to society and to succeed. Ultimately, a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people must be raised by teaching children to work together.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.; Also, write an essay for this task: The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has created a fierce debate between teachers and parents. Some argue that children who are taught to compete will become more successful adults in the future, while others argue that teaching children to co-operate will make them more effective adults. For example, working together can develop the respect and trust that is essential for long-term and meaningful relationships, whereas competition only gives rise to a selfish and individualistic attitude. In addition, competition creates a pressured environment that puts a lot of emphasis on winning, which can lead to a vicious circle of unhealthy competition, stress, and self-esteem issues when they experience failure. It is believed that teaching children to work together, share their ideas, and help each other will help them become well-rounded, responsible, and successful adults, who are able to work in a team and can be useful in society. In conclusion, although competition has its own advantages, it is believed that teaching children to work together is more beneficial for their future. It is the only way to raise a generation of cooperative and successful individuals.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.; Cooperation is more important than competition for a child’s development. Cooperation develops essential social skills like listening, speaking, understanding and problem-solving. The debate over whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has provoked much debate among teachers and parents. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they can appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of each other, which in turn can lead to the formation of a harmonious and productive team. Competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to self-esteem problems and the stress and anxiety that comes with the experience of failure. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete, they are likely to become more selfish and egotistical, so that they put their own success before the success of others. Cooperation, on the other hand, encourages the sharing of ideas and resources, which will help children grow into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. In short, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I think the benefits of teaching children to cooperate outweigh the disadvantages in the long run. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.; Since the education of children has led to heated debate among parents and educators about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate, this issue has become a burning issue. I firmly believe that the education of children to cooperate is much more beneficial for their future lives. If you have taught children to cooperate, they will develop important social skills such as communication, listening, empathy and solving problems. In addition, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for the formation of long-term relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they will appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of each other, and the resulting team will be more harmonious and productive. Eventually, they will be more apt to work together in a team in the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Besides, too much competition creates an unhealthy environment where children are obsessed with winning at all costs and thus undermining fair play and self-esteem. If children are taught to compete, they will become more individualistic and have a tendency to focus on their own success, which will lead to stress, anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem if they fail. From learning to share ideas and support each other, children become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who can build strong relationships, work effectively in teams and contribute to their community in a positive way. In my opinion, despite the advantages of competition, the education of children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Children who are taught to work together will be more successful and happier as adults.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.; A lively debate between teachers and parents concerns whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. I believe that the advantages of teaching children to co-operate outweigh those of teaching them to compete. Co-operation instills a sense of community and mutual respect, which are important in developing strong and lasting friendships. In addition, co-operation prepares children for the working world where teamwork and co-operation are highly prized. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to unhealthy obsessions with winning at any cost, leading to self-esteem and anxiety problems when they are unsuccessful. Those who are taught to work together, share ideas, and help one another, will become more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults who will be better able to function in the complexities of the real world, work more effectively in teams, and be more willing to contribute to their communities. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, in the long run, teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial. Children who are taught to co-operate will grow into compassionate, cooperative, and successful adults.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.; Speaking about the importance of education and the best way to raise children, there is a debate among parents and educators as to whether it is more important to teach children to compete or to work together. Some people argued that competition was essential for success in life, but I argued that working together is more beneficial. This is because when children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s abilities, which in turn enables them to work together well as a team. This in turn prepares them for a life in the real world where teamwork and cooperation are important. A culture of competition, if it is emphasized too much, can result in unhealthy competition that aims to win at all costs. This can lead to problems such as stress, low self-esteem and depression when children do not win. With a good grounding in working together, children are able to cope with the complexities of the real world, enabling them to work together well as a team, and contribute positively to their community. In conclusion, while I agree that competition has its advantages, I think it is more beneficial to teach children to work together in the long run. I believe that working together is the best way to raise a generation of caring, sharing and successful individuals.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges."; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been discussed a lot by educators and parents. I personally believe that children who are taught to cooperate will become better adults. Cooperation develops important social skills such as communication, understanding, listening, and problem solving. And it also helps children build relationships and trust each other. It also helps children develop their skills to be able to work in a team. Cooperation creates an environment where children learn to play fair and become good sports. On the other hand, competition creates an unhealthy obsession with winning, which in turn creates stress, anxiety and a low self-esteem. Cooperation also teaches children to help each other and to share their ideas. Children who are taught to cooperate will be more capable of building relationships with other people, and establishing and maintaining good teams. In conclusion, I think that cooperation is the most beneficial in the long run. Children who are taught to cooperate will become successful, compassionate, and cooperative members of society.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.; If you need more space for your essay, you can add the following to the title: Is it better to teach children to compete or to cooperate? Educators and parents have long debated whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate. Cooperation teaches children to respect one another and to respect the common good. This is important for building a solid relationship and can also be seen in their behavior in the world of adults, where collaboration and teamwork are highly appreciated. In addition, competition in excess of children can make them fierce, selfish, and inclined to succeed at all costs. Moreover, competition may lead to stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem when failures occur. Cooperation, on the other hand, makes children better, more sympathetic, and more able to cope with the complexities of the adult world. In the long run, it is better to teach children to cooperate. Children who grow up to be compassionate, cooperative, and successful adults will be the ones taught to cooperate.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.; When children are taught to compete or cooperate, there is a great debate between teachers and parents, and although some argue that children must be taught to compete for their success in the future, I am more in favor of teaching children to cooperate and learn to have better social skills, communication, empathy and solving problems. Besides, it will help them to build a community and mutual respect that is essential to the formation of lasting relationships. Children who work together are more aware of each other's strengths and weaknesses, which will make them a more cohesive and productive team, and this will help them later in the world where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. For another thing, competition can lead to unhealthy individualism, and when faced with failures, it leads to a feeling of anxiety, stress and lack of self-esteem. As children learn to work together, share ideas and help each other, they will become more empathetic, productive and successful people. Although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will have a longer-term positive effect. Cooperation is the foundation for a generation of compassionate, supportive and successful people.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.; Teaching children to compete or cooperate has become a major topic of debate for teachers and parents. Some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success. I disagree. Teaching children to cooperate will help them develop such social skills as communication, sympathy, and problem-solving. Cooperation also builds community and mutual respect, which are critical for building strong, lasting relationships. By working together, children learn to appreciate each other’s talents and abilities, which leads to a harmonious and productive team. Cooperation also teaches children to work together in the real world, where teamwork is essential. Moreover, an overemphasis on competition will foster a cutthroat atmosphere in which children feel they must win at all costs. This attitude will lead to an unhealthy fixation on winning, which will only cause the children to suffer from the psychological toll of anxiety, depression, and lack of self-esteem when they fail. In conclusion, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will lead to a more cohesive and empathetic adult. This will make it easier for them to navigate the complexities of the real world, which will allow them to build strong relationships, work in harmony, and make a positive contribution to society. This will lead to a more successful and empathetic adult.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.; Give your reasons for and against. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has long been the subject of discussion among educators and parents. Many people argue that children should be taught to compete because it is better for them in the future, but I am convinced that children should be taught to cooperate because it is more useful to them in the long run. Teaching children to cooperate gives them more opportunities to develop social skills such as communication, mutual understanding and problem solving. The more children cooperate, the more they will learn to get along together. In addition, working together helps children learn to appreciate each other's differences, which makes them a more productive and harmonious team in the future. Also, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, and the more important the result is, the more anxious they are, and the more self-esteem they lose. On the contrary, teaching children to compete makes them become more individualistic, so they put their own success above the success of others. When they are not able to achieve their own goals, they will be too disappointed and lose their self-esteem. Children who learn to cooperate, share ideas and help each other will become more mature, more capable of establishing a good relationship and can achieve more. In the future, they can build strong relationships, be good team players and make more contributions to the community. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I think it is better to teach children to cooperate. Because the main goal of raising children is to cultivate them to be kind, united and successful people.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.; This is a controversy among educators and parents: Should we teach children to compete or to work together? What do you think? Cooperation between children can be helpful for them in the future as well as now. Working together teaches children to respect and appreciate each other’s skills and talents, which can lead to a more cohesive and effective team. Cooperation also helps them prepare for the world of work, where teamwork and collaboration are essential to survival. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, stress, anxiety and self-esteem when faced with obstacles. On the other hand, the teaching of competition can lead to the opposite result, namely a sense of narcissism, where the child will always put his or her success before others and will suffer from a sense of defeat and anxiety when they fail. In conclusion, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial than teaching them to compete. Competition can have its benefits, but the long-term benefits of teaching children to work together outweigh them. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, effective and successful people.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.; That’s a debate among educators and parents whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Many people argue that children need to compete for success in the future. However, I believe that it is more beneficial for children to be taught to cooperate because they will develop such important social skills as communication, empathy, problem-solving, etc. Furthermore, the formation of a sense of community and mutual respect develops a foundation for building long-lasting relationships. Children who work together for the common goal learn to appreciate the skills and abilities of their fellow students, and this is a significant contribution to the preparation of children for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, competition can be damaging because it may foster a cutthroat attitude in which the students feel under pressure to achieve success at all costs, and this attitude can lead to stress, anxiety, and lower self-esteem when the students encounter failure. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and lower self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. Cooperation, however, teaches children to share ideas, help one another, and support each other, which is the best preparation for the real world, where they will be able to build strong relationships, work effectively in teams, and contribute to the community. In conclusion, I believe that although there are some benefits of competition, the long-term benefits of teaching children to cooperate outweigh the benefits of competition. To raise a generation of successful, compassionate, and selfless people, children must be taught to cooperate.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.; In my opinion, women should have a career and earn their own money. Children's education is a matter of heated discussion between teachers and parents, because some believe that teaching children to compete is more useful for their future development, whereas others believe that teaching children to co-operate is more helpful for them in future life. I believe that children should be taught to work in groups, because I believe that children develop more effectively and become more useful members of society when they learn to work in groups. Besides, when children work in groups, they will learn to respect each other, which is the foundation for building a strong relationship. Then they will be better prepared for the outside world, where teamwork and co-operation are very important. Also, teaching children to compete can make them too individualistic, and this can lead to the fact that they are anxious, nervous and depressed, and they can lose their self-esteem when they fail. When children learn to share ideas, support each other, and help each other, they will develop into more humane, empathetic and useful adults, and as they move into a complex world, they will be able to establish a good relationship with each other, work in a group and play a positive role in society. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some advantages, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. The final generation of people is one that is humane, cooperative, and successful.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them."; Teaching children to work together will help them to develop social skills such as communication, empathy and problem-solving. Whether children should be taught to compete or work together is a major debate among parents and teachers. I believe that children should be taught to work together. Also, cooperation can build a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical to building strong, lasting relationships. Also, when children work together, they can learn to appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of each other, which makes the group more harmonious and productive. Moreover, this will prepare them for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, if the emphasis on competition is too great, it will be difficult to establish a fair and healthy atmosphere, and it will be difficult for children to learn to keep a cool head when they meet difficulties. On the other hand, when children compete, they tend to be more individualistic and selfish. They are too concerned about their own success, and they become very anxious and have low self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. Then they will be unable to take on a wide range of responsibilities in the future. In summary, although there are many benefits to teaching children to compete, I think it is more beneficial to teach children to work together. In my opinion, teaching children to work together is the best way to nurture successful and compassionate people.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.; That children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has been a controversial question amongst teachers and parents. I am convinced that, whereas some people believe that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, teaching them to co-operate is more useful in preparing them for adult life. Co-operation instils in children a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building up a strong, enduring relationship. Working together towards a common goal, children learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a more productive and harmonious team. This, in turn, is essential for a successful and fulfilling life in adulthood, where collaboration and teamwork are paramount. To be constantly on the lookout for a winning team can be unhealthy and damaging to self-esteem and general health. Moreover, an excessive emphasis on competition can create a cut-throat atmosphere in which children feel that they must win at any cost, eroding their sense of fair play and mutual respect. On the other hand, teaching children to compete teaches them to place a high value on their own success and success at the expense of other people’s. Competition is useful in developing in children the capacity for enterprise and independent thought, but it also encourages a negative attitude to others. By encouraging children to work together and help each other, schools and other educational establishments can produce more balanced, empathetic and productive adults. In conclusion, teaching children to co-operate is the best way to raise a new generation of caring, sharing, successful adults.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live."; Since the idea of whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has been debated among educators and parents, and while many argue that teaching children to compete is more beneficial in preparing them for life in the modern world, I firmly believe that the idea of teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in helping them to become good adults. If children are taught to cooperate, they will be able to communicate and cooperate better, which is a major social asset. In addition, if children are taught to work together, they will understand each other better, and they will be better prepared for the world outside, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, overemphasizing competition can lead to a ruthless attitude among children, where they feel under immense pressure to achieve success at any cost, thereby undermining the importance of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they will be able to focus on their own success and this can result in the unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem when they meet obstacles. Also, children who learn to work together, share ideas and help each other become more mature, empathetic and productive adults in the real world, and they will be able to build strong relationships and make positive contributions to society. In conclusion, although there are many benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that the benefits of teaching children to work together are greater in the long run. Teaching children to co-operate is essential to raising a generation of compassionate, empathetic and successful adults.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them."; There is a heated debate among educators and parents about whether it is better to teach children to compete or to co-operate. I firmly believe that teaching children to co-operate develops essential social skills such as communication, listening, empathy and solving problems. In addition, co-operation encourages a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, which leads to a more cohesive and successful group. Also, too much competition can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause stress, anxiety and self-esteem problems for children who experience setbacks. However, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic mindset, where they put their own success before the success of others, and this can lead to a sense of frustration, anger and poor self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. Besides, when children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, they develop into more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, better able to build strong relationships, work together effectively and contribute positively to their community. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. Co-operation is essential for raising a generation of successful, compassionate and productive adults.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.; There is a lively discussion amongst educators and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. I think that co-operation, which is based on sharing, understanding and cooperation, is the more effective way of making useful citizens. For one thing, co-operation develops a sense of community and mutual respect which is essential for the building of strong and lasting relationships. Secondly, working together on a common task teaches children to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others and this prepares them for working in a real team in future. Thirdly, the emphasis on competition, especially when it is the sole method of teaching children to learn, creates a ruthless atmosphere where success is equated with petty personal gain, and this can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, resulting in anxiety, frustration and lack of self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish attitude, which values self-sufficiency over consideration for others. Fourthly, the children who learn to work together and to help each other grow into more rounded and responsible adults who are better able to cope with the complexities of the real world, where the need to build strong relationships and work effectively in a team is paramount. In conclusion, although there are advantages to both co-operation and competition, in my view the advantages of co-operation outweigh those of competition. Co-operation is an essential element in the education of a future generation of well-balanced, confident and compassionate citizens.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.; A lively debate has been going on among teachers and parents over the years, and some believe that competition is necessary for children to learn the necessary skills for their future success. My view is that teaching them to co-operate is more beneficial and will help them to be useful adults. As a result, children will develop a stronger sense of community and mutual respect, which will help them in the future to build solid relationships. Besides, when children cooperate with each other, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which leads to a more harmonious and productive team. And if children are allowed to compete too much, they may feel too much pressure to achieve success at all costs, which will undermine the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, when children are encouraged to compete, they may become too individualistic and self-centred, which may lead to stress and a lack of self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. In the end, children learn to work together, share their ideas and support each other, so they can become more empathetic, considerate and successful adults in the real world. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to encouraging children to compete, I think it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate in the long run. For a successful, empathetic and successful society, it is necessary to encourage children to cooperate.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.; The question of whether it is more important to teach children to compete or to coexist has long been discussed by educators and parents. Some argue that children need to compete to be successful in the future, while others argue that coexistence is more useful to them in the future. The first thing I can say is that teaching children to coexist is not only more beneficial, but also more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation can make children become more harmonious and more united, and it is the foundation for them to build lasting and strong relationships with each other. Cooperation can also enhance the mutual respect of children, and children can learn from each other's successes and failures, which can make them appreciate the importance of collaboration and teamwork in the future. A competition environment that is too strict and too rigid will also make children feel under pressure, so that they have no choice but to win, which will only lead to lower self-esteem and lower morale, and even depression. Compared with coexistence, competition can make children too individualistic, which will make them obsessed with success, and they will suffer from too much stress and anxiety, and they will also be affected by their self-esteem when they encounter failures. Cooperation can also make children grow up to be more sympathetic, more empathetic, more harmonious and more cooperative adults. They are more able to understand the complexities of life, establish good relationships, work well in teams and contribute to the country. Although there is also a long-term benefit to teaching children to compete, I still believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial. Cooperation is the foundation for the next generation to build a sympathetic, cooperative and successful generation.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.; A big discussion amongst parents and educators has been whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. Some argue that to teach children to compete is essential for their future success, while others argue that to teach children to co-operate is more beneficial for their future development as useful members of society. On the other hand, teaching children to co-operate is of more benefit to the society in which they will be working, where teamwork is highly valued. Moreover, a sense of community and mutual respect is developed in them, which is important for building strong and long-lasting relationships. Competition is an overly individualistic attitude, which puts individual success before the success of others, which leads to stress and a loss of self-esteem, when the children are faced with failures. It is better for them to learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, so that they become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, who are able to form strong relationships, work as a team and positively contribute to their communities. To sum up, although competition has its benefits, I would argue that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. The world needs a new generation of individuals who are empathetic, capable of working together and successful.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.; Let’s move on to the next task: “To teach children to compete or to cooperate, this is a question which is causing intense discussion among teachers and parents. The issue of whether to teach children to compete or to cooperate has led to many controversial arguments. In my view, it is better to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation helps to develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for the formation of long-term relationships. Cooperation enables children to understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses and to establish good team relationships, which in turn prepares them for future work where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, creates a cut-throat environment where children are forced to win at any cost, thus damaging the concept of fair play. The other disadvantage of teaching children to compete is that it can lead to the development of an unhealthy obsession with success and, as a result, to anxiety and stress. Cooperation, on the other hand, helps children to understand the value of sharing and collaborating, which makes them better equipped to deal with the challenges of the real world. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is better than teaching them to compete. It is also important for the future well-being of our society, as it enables us to raise a generation of tolerant, caring and successful people.”
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.; A lot of people argue that the children must be taught to compete in order to be able to achieve something in life. I strongly disagree. The purpose of education should be to teach children to cooperate, rather than to compete. Cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building a strong relationship. Cooperation is also good for children because it makes them good team members, and it makes them ready for the future world where the value of teamwork is extremely high. Competition on the other hand, creates a feeling of being cut-throat and unethical, which gives the children a false sense of importance and a false pride in their achievements. This also creates a stress that makes them unable to cope with failures. Cooperation makes children become well-balanced, empathetic and productive adults. They are able to deal with the complex world better and can make good relationships, work in a team and be a positive contributor to the community. To conclude, although competition has its advantages, I think it is more beneficial in the long run to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation in the school system is the way forward to create a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.; In my opinion, it is a bad idea for children to have a job while they are still studying. Teaching children to cooperate has been a source of controversy between parents and teachers. Some people argue that children need to be taught to compete for future success. Others argue that children need to learn to work together to become useful members of society. Cooperation can also lead to a strong and mutually respectful bond between children. Cooperation helps children learn to work together. Cooperation also prepares them for the world where people work together and where cooperation is a high priority. It can also cause children to become more selfish and overly obsessed with winning at all costs. It can also reduce fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic mentality, and when children fail, they will become upset and lose their self-esteem. Cooperation can help children develop into more confident and cooperative adults, who will be better able to form strong relationships, work together and contribute to society. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some advantages, teaching children to cooperate has more advantages in the long run. Cooperation is essential for raising a generation of children who will be compassionate, cooperative and successful.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.; The debate on whether to teach children to compete or co-operate has caused heated discussion among parents and educators. The argument is that teaching children to compete is a more important means of preparing them for future success. My opinion is that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial for them as they become adults. Co-operation also creates a sense of community and respect for others, which are necessary for building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to appreciate the weaknesses and strengths of others. They learn to work in a more cohesive and efficient team. In addition, competition can foster a cut-throat attitude in children, a belief that success can be attained at any cost, and a lack of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may develop an overly individualistic attitude, a preoccupation with their own success and the possibility of a loss of self-esteem and self-confidence when they fail to achieve their goals. When children learn to work together, to share ideas and help each other, they become more well-rounded, empathetic, and successful as adults. They will be able to form strong and lasting relationships and work more efficiently in a team, thereby benefiting their communities. In conclusion, I believe that, while competition has its benefits, teaching children to co-operate is more important for their long-term success. It is essential for creating a more compassionate, empathetic, and successful generation.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.; But, I think, this discussion has opened a controversial topic for teachers and parents. If it is true that teaching children to compete and not to cooperate is more beneficial for their future success, I will argue that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their usefulness as adults. Cooperation develops a sense of solidarity and mutual respect, which is essential for building long-term relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, which will be very useful in the future in the adult world where collaboration and teamwork are highly appreciated. Cooperation also means avoiding the problems associated with a strong desire to compete, because the child may be inclined to compete with others without thinking of other perspectives. The competition teaches children to think only about their success and when they fail, they feel anxious, ill and low self-esteem. Cooperation on the other hand means that children will become more selfless, empathetic, sociable and a productive adult. If they are taught to work together, share ideas and support each other, they will later be better equipped to work in a team and be able to create good relationships and add something to their community. In conclusion, I would say that teaching children to compete is not without its advantages, but that teaching children to cooperate is a more profitable idea in the long run. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of empathetic, supportive and successful people.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.; Presenting a solution: a number of parents and educators have begun to debate whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate. Some believe that competition is essential for children’s future success. I argue that teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial to them as adults. In addition, it will help children develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential for building lasting relationships. Moreover, by working together children can learn to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which in turn makes them a better team and helps them to be better prepared for a world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. A focus on competition also puts an unhealthy emphasis on winning, which can lead to children becoming stressed, anxious and self-conscious when they encounter setbacks. Teaching children to compete instead can lead to an unhealthy emphasis on individualism and success at the expense of others, which can lead to a high level of stress and self-esteem when children do not achieve their goals. Cooperation can, on the other hand, help children to become well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who are able to cope with the complexities of the world and to create and maintain strong relationships. In conclusion, while I agree that competition has its advantages, I think that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to them as they grow older. Children should be taught to cooperate in order to foster a new generation of compassionate, hard-working and successful adults.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.; On this occasion, the admonition of teachers and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate is a topic of great controversy. While some argue that competition is necessary for children to be able to succeed in life, others are convinced that cooperation is more beneficial for children's future. Cooperation also builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which is useful in building strong and lasting relationships. Cooperation is useful because it teaches children to understand each other's abilities and strengths. This is useful for children in the future, because the world is a place where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Children who are taught to compete may have an unhealthy desire to succeed at all costs, which may result in stress and a lack of self-esteem when they are confronted with failure. In contrast, children who are taught to compete may have a more individualistic approach, in which they place their own success above others, and if they experience failure, their self-esteem and self-confidence will decline. Cooperation develops more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. Children will be better prepared for the world's complexity, for building relationships, for working in groups and for contributing to their communities. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is ultimately more beneficial. Children will be more empathetic, cooperative and successful as adults if they are taught to cooperate.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.; Cooperation or competition is a very controversial topic among teachers and parents. Some believe that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, but I disagree. Teaching children to cooperate can be more beneficial for them as adults. Cooperation instills in them the sense of community and mutual respect necessary to develop close friendships. Also, working together to achieve a common goal teaches children to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which can be very useful when working in a group. In addition, an emphasis on competition can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety, stress and a loss of self-esteem when the child is unsuccessful. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can make them egotistical, make them focus on their own success, not others, and lead to unhealthy obsession with success, stress and loss of self-esteem when they have setbacks. Cooperation can lead to well-rounded, empathic and productive adults, who will be able to manage more effectively in the complex world and contribute to the community. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, in the long run it is more beneficial to teach them to cooperate. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.; ? The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has led to an intense debate among educators and parents. Some people think that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, but I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for the adult they will become. Cooperation teaches them the importance of teamwork and mutual respect, which will serve them well in the world of adults, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Cooperation also allows children to learn to recognize the weaknesses and strengths of their peers, which in turn helps them to build a cohesive team, which is beneficial to them. As well as that, a culture of competition can lead to unhealthy pressure to succeed, which can lead to anxiety and self-esteem issues when they encounter failures. In addition, teaching children to compete can lead to a dangerous individualism, which can be detrimental to their self-esteem. Cooperation, on the other hand, allows children to share their ideas, and by doing so, they become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive people who are better able to build strong relationships, work well with others and contribute to their communities. In short, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, compassionate and successful individuals.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.; A lot of controversy has arisen about the best way to teach children to compete or to cooperate. Some argue that teaching children to compete is more important for their future success, but I think it is more important to teach children to cooperate. By teaching children to cooperate, they learn to be more helpful, better to communicate, understand, and solve problems. Cooperation also encourages a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very useful for building long-term relationships. Cooperation also helps them learn how to work together in a group, so they are better prepared for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are valued. Competition can also lead to a very unhealthy individualistic attitude where success is given more importance than other people. When children encounter difficulties in their careers, they may experience a drop in self-esteem. By learning to share ideas and help each other, children will become more mature, more empathetic and productive adults, who can navigate the complexity of the real world, build strong relationships, work effectively in a group and contribute positively to their community. In conclusion, while competition can have its benefits, I believe that in the long run it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. In the end, raising a generation of people with a cooperative attitude will create a more successful, empathetic and prosperous society.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.; I think it's better to teach children to cooperate than to compete. The argument that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success is becoming a frequent subject of debate among teachers and parents. However, I strongly disagree with this idea. Cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is the foundation of strong and lasting relationships. Cooperation is also important in preparing children for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are important values. Moreover, too much emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment, where children feel they must succeed at all costs, undermining the values of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning and, as a result, the anxiety, stress, and self-esteem that come from a loss of self-esteem when they experience failure. By contrast, children who learn to work together, share ideas, and help each other to succeed develop into more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. Cooperation is also more useful in the long run, while competition is more useful in the short run. Basically, teaching children to cooperate is essential to raising a compassionate, cooperative, and successful generation.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it."; While many parents and teachers have expressed their concern about whether to teach children to compete or to cooperate, some believe that teaching children to compete is better for their future success, while others believe that teaching children to cooperate is better for their future. Cooperation fosters the feeling of kinship and mutual respect, and it also promotes the formation of a close relationship with others. It is also a good preparation for the real world, which requires people to cooperate and build a group. A strong emphasis on competition also makes children too busy and make them feel guilty, so they are more anxious and self-esteemed when they lose. On the other hand, teaching children to compete makes them more self-conscious, more obsessed with their own achievements, and they are often depressed when they are rejected. Cooperation helps children learn to share, support and help each other, and it is conducive to their growth. When they are adults, they will be more capable of dealing with the real world, and they will be able to work together and play a role in their communities. In summary, although competition has its benefits, I still believe that children should be taught to cooperate. In the end, if the world can be built by the hands of the whole society, then we should teach children to cooperate.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.; There has been a great deal of discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate. Many parents and educators argue that teaching children to compete is the best way to prepare them for a successful future. I, on the other hand, am firmly of the opinion that teaching children to co-operate develops in them essential social skills, such as the ability to communicate, to empathize, to think and to solve problems. Moreover, by teaching children to co-operate, we are teaching them a sense of community and mutual respect, which is vital in a world where collaboration and co-operation are highly valued. Besides, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish, cut-throat mentality, in which they put their own success before that of others. Such a mentality can lead to stress, anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem when they face failure. As a result, children may be less able to handle the complexity of real life and may lack the ability to build relationships and work as a team. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, I believe that teaching them to co-operate is ultimately more beneficial. For example, teaching children to co-operate enables them to succeed and thrive in a society that increasingly values collaboration and co-operation.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.; Give reasons for your answer. As we know, a lot of arguments are going on between teachers and parents whether to teach children to compete or to co-operate. While many of them argue that competition is a good skill for them in the future, I firmly believe that cooperation is the better way for them to become good adults. Cooperation enables them to have a strong sense of community and mutual respect, which is an important foundation for establishing strong, enduring relationships. To teach children to compete teaches them to value their success above all else, to feel anxious and depressed if they do not achieve it, and to be obsessed with winning, which is unhealthy and can lead to a loss of self-esteem. Cooperation helps them to learn how to share, support and care for one another. Cooperation helps them to build strong friendships, work in a team and help others in need. In conclusion, while competition is good for some children, I think that cooperation is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is essential to help children develop into caring, successful adults.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity."; He should be taught to compete or to cooperate with others, has long been a heated debate among educators and parents. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful than teaching them to compete for their future success. Cooperation is not only beneficial for children in the short run, but also gives them a sense of solidarity and mutual respect, which is necessary for the development of a harmonious society. Cooperation can also help them adapt to the harsh environment of the future, where the importance of teamwork and collaboration is increasing day by day. It is easy to lead to selfishness and a sense of self-esteem, and the spirit of fair competition and sportsmanship is lost. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an egocentric and selfish mindset, and there is a high risk of stress, anxiety, and self-esteem when encountering obstacles. Cooperation makes children grow up to be more well-rounded, more understanding, more practical, and more capable of learning from others. As they grow up, they will be able to make friends, build teams, and help the country develop. In short, although there is a certain advantage to teaching children to compete, I still believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for them in the long run. Cooperation is the best way to cultivate people with love and cooperation.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.; The issue of whether or not children should be taught to compete or cooperate has aroused great interest and debate among educators and parents, while others argue that teaching children to compete will make them more successful in the future, I think it is better to teach children to work together and will make them a more useful person. In teaching children to cooperate, children can learn important social skills such as listening, communicating, helping each other, and solving problems. Besides, they can develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important for the formation of relationships between people. When children cooperate, they can appreciate each other's strength and weaknesses, which can form a harmonious team, and help them to learn to work together in the future. In addition, when children compete, they will feel a sense of competition, which is not conducive to fair competition, and they may also experience anxiety, depression and even low self-esteem because of failures. Compared with the teaching of cooperation, the education of competition will make children selfish and have an excessive ego, which will lead to a sense of anxiety and depression, and eventually affect their self-esteem. When they are able to share ideas and help each other, children will become more mature, sympathetic, and useful people, and they will be able to build a harmonious society in the future. Although the teaching of competition has its own advantages, I think that the teaching of cooperation is more beneficial to children's development. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is an important foundation for the future construction of a sympathetic, peaceful, and efficient person.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture."; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has caused great discussion among parents and teachers. Some say that children should be taught to compete in order to achieve success in life. I strongly disagree with this idea. Cooperation teaches children to be patient with others, respect others and show kindness. Cooperation is an important foundation for friendship and a lifelong commitment. In addition, if competition is taught too much, it may lead to a cutthroat attitude to children, causing them to be forced to succeed in the game at all costs. If they fail, they will be very disappointed, lose their self-esteem and be very upset. Children should be taught to share ideas and support each other. Cooperation will make children well-rounded, empathetic, hardworking and productive adults. In my opinion, although competition has its benefits, I think teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is a prerequisite for raising a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.; There has been much debate in the past about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Some people argue that it is more beneficial for children to compete because they develop important social skills such as communication, understanding, empathy and problem solving. Cooperation develops the skills of communication, understanding, empathy and respect, which are necessary for building strong relationships. When children work together, they can understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which can lead to a more productive and cohesive team. The team is then ready for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are very much appreciated. Moreover, the environment of competition can create a ruthless and demanding environment, and the value of fairness and sportsmanship is sometimes undermined. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy obsession with their own success, which can lead to stress, anxiety and self-esteem when they encounter failure. Cooperation makes children more empathetic and productive adults who are able to manage the complexity of the real world, build strong relationships, work together effectively and contribute to the community. In conclusion, although there are many benefits to teaching children to compete, I think that in the long run, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial. In the end, the generation of cooperative, compassionate and successful individuals is necessary.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.; A lot of educators and parents are discussing whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some think that teaching children to compete is more important for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their later lives. Cooperation can foster mutual respect, which is a necessary foundation for building and maintaining strong relationships. Working together to achieve a common goal makes children realize the benefits of collaboration and they become more able to get along. In the real world, working together is a highly valued skill. Moreover, competition can foster an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, and a bad temper. On the other hand, competition can lead to an unhealthy individualistic attitude in which children emphasize their own success at the expense of others. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate makes them well-rounded, productive, and empathetic adults who can handle the complexity of the real world better and help the community grow and develop. Cooperation has its benefits, but in the long run, teaching children to cooperate has more advantages. In the end, it is teaching children to cooperate that makes them empathetic, productive, and successful.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws."; Teaching children to cooperate is an issue that teachers and parents have been debating for a long time. Although some claim that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in helping them become good people. Cooperation also creates a strong community of mutual trust and respect, and is therefore an important foundation for the construction of life-long friendship. In the end, it is cooperation that makes people work together more efficiently. Besides, it is a vicious circle if you want to compete all the time, which will lead to a lot of stress and anxiety, and the lack of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete will make them overly individualistic and focus on their own success at the expense of others, which will result in stress, anxiety and self-esteem problems if they lose. Teaching children to cooperate, so that they can learn to work together, share their ideas and support each other, will make them more mature, empathetic, and productive people. As they enter society and face the complexity of the world, they will be better able to build strong relationships, work effectively with others and contribute positively to their community. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, efficient and successful people.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.; Amongst parents and teachers there is a heated discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. While some maintain that teaching children to compete is essential to future success, I believe that teaching them to co-operate is more beneficial in preparing them for life as useful adults. For co-operation develops in children a sense of community and mutual respect which are the foundations of a healthy, functioning society. Children who work together and solve problems together are better able to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues, and this can only make them better team players in the future, when the need for collaboration and teamwork is so common. Besides, a tendency towards competition creates an unhealthy desire to win at all costs, which can lead to a tendency towards unhappiness and unhealthy levels of stress and anxiety. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can make them too individualistic, making them put their own success before the success of others. Then, when they have setbacks and are unsuccessful, they can become very anxious and, as a result, lack self-esteem. Consequently, co-operation is more beneficial in the long run, making children more mature and balanced, better able to work with others and deal with the complexities of life. In the end, although competition does have its advantages, teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. Thus, the most important thing is to teach children to co-operate, and by this means make them more mature and more balanced, more capable of working with others.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict."; As a child, we teach him to compete. However, he also learns to cooperate, and it is a great advantage for the development of social skills such as communication, understanding, cooperation and problem-solving. Whether we should teach children to compete or cooperate has aroused great debate among educators and parents. Cooperation is beneficial for children, because it creates a sense of community and mutual respect that can be carried over into adulthood. It also helps them to develop into a well-organized and productive team in the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also helps to promote fairness and sportsmanship, which are also highly valued in society. On the other hand, if we teach children to compete, they can become too individualistic, preferring their own success to that of others, and a desire to win so strongly that they become ill-mannered, anxious and self-disliked if they lose. Cooperation, however, helps children to become well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, who are better able to work together, share ideas and work together to solve problems in the real world. Although competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation is more beneficial for children in the long run. Cooperation is essential to raising a generation of empathetic, compassionate, and successful people.
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.; Some educators and parents argue that it is better to teach children to compete than to cooperate. I disagree, I think teaching children to cooperate is better than teaching them to compete. Teaching children to cooperate will teach them important social skills such as communication, listening, empathy, and problem-solving. Moreover, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical to building strong, lasting relationships. Besides, children can appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses when they work together to achieve the same goal, which can help them to work together more effectively and productively in the future. And teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, resulting in stress, anxiety, and a lack of self-esteem when they fail. On the other hand, teaching children to compete will lead them to be overly individualistic, causing them to value their success more than the success of others. Teaching children to cooperate will help them become well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults who can successfully navigate the complexities of life and contribute to their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to cooperate will ultimately benefit them more. Cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative, and successful people.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question."; For many years there has been a debate in education circles and among parents as to whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. I would argue that it is better to teach children to work together because it gives them a better chance of being useful adults. The work of a group is often more important than the work of one person. It also develops a sense of community and mutual respect, and that is very important in a society where collaboration and teamwork are highly prized. If competition is emphasised too much it can lead to unhealthy competition between children, with unhealthy pressure to win at all costs, and that can destroy fair play and good sportsmanship. The teaching of competition also develops an unhealthy focus on the self, a concern with winning at all costs, and a low self-esteem in the face of defeat. Children who are taught to work together are likely to be more mature, empathetic, and productive adults who are better prepared for the complexities of adult life. In my view, teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. In my opinion, it is essential if we want to raise a generation of empathetic, hard-working, and successful adults.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.; Students are learning to compete in schools, argues a recent debate. However, the opposite is the case, because it is much more effective to develop children's cooperative skills and train them to communicate, share and solve problems with each other. Furthermore, co-operation promotes a sense of community and mutual respect, which is a necessary foundation for the establishment of strong relationships. In addition, cooperation prepares children for the real world, where the ability to cooperate and work together is highly appreciated. Furthermore, competition often creates a hostile environment where children feel under pressure to succeed at all costs, and the emphasis on fairness and sportsmanship is undermined. Moreover, teaching children to compete creates a mindset where they put their own success before the success of others, which can lead to an unhealthy preoccupation with winning and therefore to anxiety, tension and self-esteem when they fail. In the end, children who learn to cooperate, share and support each other are better prepared for life, where they can build strong relationships and play an important role in the communities they live in. In conclusion, although there are many advantages to teaching children to compete, it is much more effective to teach children to cooperate. It is essential to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.; if they live in a society where there is no kitchen. I think that children are taught to compete because it is important for their future success, while others believe that teaching them to cooperate will make them useful adults. Cooperation builds the basis for respect for each other and is essential for building strong relationships. Cooperation among children teaches them to appreciate the other's strengths and weaknesses, so that they can work together effectively and more efficiently. Cooperation is a basic life skill and is essential for the development of many other skills that are necessary for the development of the team. The tendency to compete creates a stressful environment in which children feel the need to win at all costs, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing them to feel sad and frustrated when they fail. Cooperation among children teaches them to share ideas and support each other. Children grow up as more well-developed, empathetic and productive adults who can easily adapt to the complexities of life and are better able to build strong relationships, work in teams and serve their communities in a more positive way. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to cooperate is better for the long term. Children who are taught to cooperate grow up to be compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.; I think children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. While some educators and parents think that learning to compete is useful for children's future success, I firmly believe that learning to cooperate is more useful in the future of children. Cooperation teaches people to work together, to respect each other and to work together, which is very important for establishing good and lasting relationships. In addition, by working together, the children learn to respect each other, which is also useful for the future work in society. In addition, the overemphasis on competition leads to the establishment of a competition spirit that dominates the children, which teaches them to achieve their goals at any cost, and in the long run undermines the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the contrary, competition leads to a sense of individualism in children, which leads to the fact that children are obsessed with success and, as a result, their self-esteem is affected, which causes stress and anxiety. Cooperation is the basis of an educated and well-adjusted personality, capable of creating strong relationships and working together in a team. In my opinion, despite the advantages of competition, it is more useful for children to be taught to cooperate. Children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.; I think the government should spend more money on theaters and sports stadiums. In addition, the education of children in competition or cooperation has also aroused the attention of teachers and parents. Some people think that children should be taught to compete because competition is the way to success in the future, but I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more conducive to their later useful life. Cooperation can make people respect each other, and the value of a group is more important than that of an individual. Children who work together will learn to respect each other, and the group will be more united, and it will also be beneficial to the future work of cooperation. Competition is only a way to achieve personal success, and children are taught to compete at all costs, which will lead to a loss of self-esteem when they encounter difficulties, which will also result in low self-esteem. Cooperation can make children learn to work together, share ideas, and support each other, and become more well-rounded, empathetic, and capable adults, who are capable of building a harmonious relationship with others and are capable of working together. In short, although competition also has its benefits, I still think that teaching children to cooperate is more conducive to their future lives. Cooperation is the foundation of a group of people who are capable of loving, working together, and achieving success.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.; This is a question that has been hotly debated among educators and parents. There is a tendency to teach children to compete with each other, which they say is necessary for their future success. But I would say that teaching children to work together is more beneficial, since it develops their social skills, like communicating, empathy, and problem solving. Cooperation also fosters the sense of community and mutual respect that are necessary to establish and maintain strong, lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to appreciate the value of others, and are able to get along with each other and work more productively. Cooperation also discourages selfishness, which is unhealthy in children, since it makes them anxious and self-conscious, which in turn can lead to a drop in self-esteem. On the other hand, competition leads to an unhealthy emphasis on individual achievement, which can cause them to be overly anxious and less confident if they lose. Children who learn to share, work together, and support each other are more well-rounded and better able to deal with the complexities of the world as adults, building stronger relationships and more effectively contributing to their communities. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to work together is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation, rather than competition, is the best way to raise a successful, well-adjusted individual.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful."; E.G. It has long been a subject of controversy among educators and parents whether to teach children to compete or to co-operate. It is argued that competition is necessary for the future success of children, but I believe that teaching children to co-operate can be more beneficial in the development of useful citizens. Co-operation teaches respect for each other and the building of strong relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s weaknesses and strengths, forming a cohesive, well-functioning team. And this, in turn, prepares them for the real world, where teamwork and cooperation are regarded as valuable qualities. Besides, competition can create a cutthroat atmosphere, where children feel compelled to win at any cost, and this could lead to a lack of fair play and a lack of sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can result in stress and a loss of self-esteem when the child fails. A child who learns to co-operate will become a more rounded and empathetic person, who will be better equipped to face the realities of life and to build strong relationships and contribute positively to society. In conclusion, while competition does have its advantages, I believe that the long-term benefits of teaching children to co-operate outweigh those of teaching them to compete. Co-operation is the cornerstone of a compassionate, successful society.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.; Cooperation or competition is the topic of the fiercest debate among educators and parents. Many believe that teaching children to compete is a prerequisite for success in later life, but I disagree with the assumption that it is more useful for children to learn to cooperate, because children can learn important social skills, such as communication, understanding, empathy and problem-solving. In addition, the community of cooperation is the foundation for building strong, lasting relationships. Cooperation can help children better understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this is an advantage in the world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy individualism, and a constant struggle to win at any cost, leading to stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem when children face setbacks. Competition can also lead to unhealthy self-esteem and, in the event of failure, to a sense of personal failure. Cooperation, on the other hand, builds on a sense of solidarity, which can be of great value in the complex world of adults. In conclusion, although competition is important, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is an essential tool for raising a generation of people who are compassionate, cooperative and successful.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles."; , at least 200 words. You will find this task here: Writing task 2 - Whether it is better to teach children to compete or to co-operate has been a heated discussion among parents and teachers. While some believe that it is important to learn to compete for future success, I believe that learning to co-operate is more beneficial for children in the long run. Co-operation develops children's ability to communicate, empathize and solve problems. The ability to work together is a good preparation for life where co-operation is the most important. Children working together towards a common goal also learn to respect each other's differences, which will create a harmonious and productive team. Moreover, a strong emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment where the child is encouraged to succeed at any cost, which can undermine fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, children who are taught to compete can have a narcissistic personality and are obsessed with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they fail. Besides, if children learn to co-operate and help each other, they will grow up to be more responsible and mature people who can establish strong relationships, work together and contribute positively to their community. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that it is better for children to learn to co-operate than to compete. In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is an essential part of raising compassionate, co-operative and successful people.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised."; The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has recently caused much discussion among teachers and parents. While some people argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I believe that encouraging children to work together is more beneficial in making them useful and socially aware adults. Furthermore, co-operation helps to develop a sense of community and mutual respect, both of which are vital in building long-lasting relationships. If children work together, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses and thus become a more cohesive and productive group. This, in turn, prepares them for the outside world where working in a team is considered essential. Meanwhile, too much emphasis on competition creates an unhealthy obsession with winning and a lack of tolerance for those who do not succeed. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can result in an unhealthy obsession with self-sufficiency, and children can suffer from lack of self-esteem and anxiety when they encounter problems. Through working together, children learn to share ideas and solve problems. As a result, they are more capable of dealing with the complex problems of real life, and they can contribute more effectively to society as a whole. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that the long-term benefits of encouraging children to work together outweigh those of teaching them to compete. There can be no doubt that teaching children to work together is the best way to produce useful and well-adjusted adults.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.; I am not saying that all advertisements should be banned. But I do think that we should be careful what advertisements are shown to children, and teach them to think about others as well as themselves. This is not the same as saying that we should teach children to compete, rather than to co-operate. Co-operation leads to mutual respect and a strong sense of community, which are important in the development of strong friendships. Children learn to recognize each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which leads to more harmonious and productive group work, and thereby prepares them for the world outside, where teamwork is considered a virtue. Competition leads to unhealthy competition, in which children are encouraged to compete at all costs, and thus lose the value of fair play and good sportsmanship. It also makes children over-dependent on competition, and leaves them feeling guilty and upset when they don’t win. Children learn from co-operation, by sharing their ideas and helping each other. They become more balanced, empathic and sociable people, who are better able to work together to achieve a common goal. In my opinion, although competition has its advantages, co-operation is more important in the long run. In the end, teaching children to co-operate is essential for the development of a compassionate, cohesive and successful society.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.; If you want to work at home, you can find it difficult to find time to do everything you want to do. A recent debate in the United States over whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has led to heated discussions between parents and educators. I firmly believe that teaching children to work together will help them develop better social skills, such as teamwork, communication, empathy and problem solving. Co-operation helps children learn to respect each other and to form strong relationships. Moreover, by working together, children learn to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which will make them a more cohesive and productive group in the future. The competition, on the other hand, is a vicious circle in which children feel that they must achieve first place at all costs, which may lead to a lack of fairness and a lack of sportsmanship. The children who compete with each other become obsessed with winning and become upset when they lose, which can result in reduced self-esteem and depression. They will also be less able to cope with the difficulties of the real world. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. It is important to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject."; Let me add, it has also been discussed whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. This has sparked a heated debate between educators and parents. My own view is that children are more useful as adults if they learn to cooperate. Cooperation also creates a feeling of community and mutual respect, which is essential to building a strong and lasting relationship. In addition, the value of teamwork is higher than that of competition, which gives children a better insight into the real world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Competition is also very difficult to succeed in school, and it often leads to a stressful, unhealthy and selfish environment where children feel a constant need to win at any cost. This can lead to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when faced with failure. By learning to work together, share ideas and support each other, children can develop into well-rounded, productive and empathetic adults, able to work more effectively in teams and be more positive in their communities. In summary, although competition has its benefits, I believe it is more useful to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation is the most effective way to raise a generation of caring, compassionate and successful people.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.; Co-operation or competition is the subject of a lot of discussion among teachers and parents. While some people argue that competition is good for children and they can develop useful skills by learning to compete, I think that teaching children to co-operate can be more useful and can give them a good start in life. As well as developing the important social skills of mutual respect and a sense of community, co-operation can also be a useful preparation for adult life, where a team approach is needed to achieve the desired result. In addition, an excessive focus on competition can create an environment where children are expected to achieve at any cost, which can undermine the importance of fair play and sportsmanship. Conversely, teaching children to compete can lead to a tendency to place their own success above that of others, which can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing stress and anxiety and lowering self-esteem when they fail. By learning to work together and support each other, children can develop into rounded, well-adjusted and productive adults, better able to build relationships, work in a team and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that, in the long run, co-operation can be more beneficial. Therefore, I believe that it is more important to teach children to co-operate in order to raise a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.; (150 words) A debate on whether children should be taught to compete or coexist has been an issue of controversy among teachers and parents for decades. While some argue that competition is necessary for children to grow up to be more successful adults, I firmly believe that coexistence is more beneficial for children to become useful adults. Teaching children to coexist can develop social skills such as communication, collaboration, empathy, and problem-solving. Moreover, coexistence teaches children the value of mutual respect and helps build strong relationships in their adult lives. When children work together for a common goal, they will understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and the group will become more cohesive and more productive. Competition can lead to the development of unhealthy and unhealthy individualistic thinking that tries to achieve personal success at the expense of others. Children are often very anxious and have low self-esteem when they fail to achieve their goals, which can also lead to their personal development. Children who are taught to coexist can grow up to be well-rounded, helpful, and empathetic adults who can negotiate with others in the future. Assist. In my opinion, although competition has its benefits, I still prefer to teach children to coexist, because in the long run it is more beneficial for children to become good adults. Coexistence can be a valuable foundation for raising a compassionate, cohesive, and successful generation.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.; Here is the sample essay: Cooperation and competition have become a controversial issue in schools and families. Although some argue that competition is essential for children's future success, I think cooperation is the more effective way of bringing up children to be useful and independent adults. Cooperation teaches children to respect each other, and respect for each other is the foundation of good relationships. Also, when children work together, they can learn to respect the strength and weakness of others. This is very important in the real world, where teamwork and solidarity are highly valued. In addition, competition can make children feel pressured to win at any cost, which makes them lose respect for others and cause them to feel depressed. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may develop an unhealthy inclination to win at all costs, and they will be disappointed, sad and anxious when they are unsuccessful. Cooperation teaches children to share ideas and support each other, and they will become well-rounded, empathetic and active adults, who can navigate the complex real world, build good relationships and contribute to the community. In short, although competition has some benefits, I think that in the long run, teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial. Cooperation is the foundation for children to grow up to be compassionate, cooperative and successful adults.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.; When you should teach children to compete or cooperate, the controversy has aroused educators and parents. Some people argue that children should be taught to compete for their future success, but I firmly believe that children should be taught to cooperate. If they can cooperate, they will have the necessary social skills, such as communication, empathy and problem-solving. In addition, cooperation leads to mutual respect, which is important for long-term relationships. In addition, children who work together in harmony for a common goal learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which leads to a more efficient and productive team. Cooperation will prepare children for the real world where cooperation and collaboration are regarded as a high priority. A competition that is overemphasized in a child may lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, and if they are unsuccessful, they will suffer from stress and anxiety and have a low self-esteem. Cooperation will create a more rounded, caring and productive adult. Cooperation will teach children to navigate the complex world of relationships, working together and making a positive contribution to their community. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think it is more advantageous for children to be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.; Whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has been the subject of discussion by teachers and parents for a long time. The teaching of competition has been argued to be necessary for the future success of children, while the teaching of co-operation is more useful for making them good citizens. Co-operation is important for promoting harmony, the understanding of individuality, and a mutual respect that is needed for long-term relationships. In this way, children can be well prepared for the real world, where harmony and teamwork are highly valued. The teaching of competition can lead to the development of a purely individualistic mind-set, where the only thing that matters is success, and to a disdain for fairness and the notion of being fair. When they fail, their self-esteem is damaged and they lose their desire to try again. With the co-operation of children, they become a rounded, empathetic, and productive citizen who can cope with the complex issues of the real world, and is able to maintain strong relationships, build and maintain teams, and contribute positively to the community. In short, although there are some advantages to the teaching of competition, I believe that the teaching of co-operation has a more long-term effect. To be able to raise children who can become compassionate, cohesive, and successful people, the teaching of co-operation should be essential.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.; The debate about whether it is better to teach children to compete or to cooperate has created a lot of discussions among the educators and parents. While some people argue that teaching children to compete is the best way to teach them to be successful in life, I strongly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important for the future of children. Cooperation helps them to learn the necessary social skills, such as communication, understanding, mutual support and the ability to solve problems. Moreover, children learn to work together with mutual respect, which is essential for building strong relationships. Cooperation also helps children to be aware of the other’s abilities and weaknesses, which makes them appreciate and work more as a team. In the future, this will be very useful for them. But competition often creates a cutthroat environment, where children are forced to win at all costs, which destroys the concept of fair play and good sportsmanship. Moreover, competition leads to an unhealthy obsession with success, which leads to anxiety, stress and low self-esteem when a child fails. The children who learn to work together, share ideas and help each other develop into more caring, helpful and cooperative adults, who are better able to face the complexities of the real world and become more productive members of society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think that it is better to teach children to cooperate than to compete. Cooperation is essential for the children to develop the necessary social skills to become a well-adjusted and successful person.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.; The idea of teaching children to compete or to coexist has been the subject of debate for some time among teachers and parents. While some people argue that teaching children to compete is important for their future success, I believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial for them to be useful adults in the future. Coexisting with others teaches them the importance of trust and respect, which is very important in building lasting relationships. Children who learn to coexist also learn to value each other's abilities and respect them more, and they are more likely to work together well in a team. A competition can also be used as a breeding ground for unhealthy individualism, and when the pressure to win is too great, children are less likely to learn the importance of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish mentality in which they only value themselves and their success. They will then be more inclined to have an unhealthy obsession with winning and then will have anxiety and less self-esteem when they have to face defeat. Children who are taught to coexist grow up to be more useful, more empathetic, and more productive adults. As they face the difficulties of real life, they are more able to build strong relationships, work well in teams, and be more helpful in society. In short, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I think teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. Coexistence is the foundation for a caring, cooperative, and successful generation.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.; I know that some parents and teachers believe that teaching children to compete rather than to cooperate will make them better prepared for life as adults. I disagree. Teaching children to cooperate gives them social skills like cooperation, communication, empathy, and problem solving. It also develops mutual respect, which is essential for a group to function well and effectively. Children who work together on a task learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a more cohesive and effective group. And they are prepared for the real world where teamwork and collaboration are valued. Besides, a cutthroat environment where children feel they must win at all costs will destroy the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can make them more selfish, and a strong desire to win can lead to stress, anxiety, and a drop in self-esteem. By teaching children to cooperate, they will become more caring, empathetic, and capable adults, able to deal with the complexities of life, build good relationships, and make positive contributions. In my opinion, teaching children to compete is a mistake. Cooperation, not competition, is the key to raising a compassionate, caring, and successful generation.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.; In recent years there has been much discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. While some people argue that competition is essential to future success, I would argue that co-operation is more beneficial in making children useful adults. In the first place, working together to achieve a common goal enables children to develop respect for each other and to learn to work well together. This is excellent preparation for adult life, where the importance of co-operation and teamwork is recognised. In addition, too much emphasis on competition can lead to an unhealthy emphasis on winning at all costs, undermining fair play and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, too much emphasis on competition can result in a purely individualistic outlook, where children put their own success above all else, resulting in low self-esteem and stress when they have to cope with setbacks. Children who learn to work together, sharing ideas and helping each other, will become more mature, more empathetic and more capable of coping with the complexities of adult life. In conclusion, while there are advantages to teaching children to compete, in the long run it is better to teach them to work together. It is essential for the success of future generations that children learn to work together and to respect each other.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has been the subject of discussion among parents and teachers for decades. While some claim that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I argue that children who learn to cooperate will be more useful adults in the long run. Cooperation builds the foundation for respect, which is important for creating a strong community. Cooperation enables children to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes the group more cohesive and productive. Cooperation also teaches children to understand the value of a fair game and to play to win. On the other hand, a heavy emphasis on competition may lead children to become incredibly self-centered and prone to anxiety, depression, and a lack of self-esteem when they are unsuccessful. By learning to share ideas, solve problems, and help each other, children develop into well-rounded, compassionate, and productive adults who are better prepared to work with others, forge strong relationships, and make positive contributions to their communities. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I believe that the long-term advantages of teaching children to cooperate outweigh those of teaching them to compete. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, productive, and successful adults.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.; Let’s say you agree. Here are my suggestions: . . The debate whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has caused heated debate among educators and parents. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate makes them more useful people in the future. . . Cooperative behavior makes children understand the value of working together in harmony, which is a great preparation for their future careers. . . In contrast, teaching children to compete creates an unhealthy obsession with success at any cost. It makes children lose respect for themselves and others if they fail. . . In my view, children who learn to cooperate become more valuable citizens of the future, able to build strong relationships with other people, work effectively in teams and be of more use to their communities. . . In conclusion, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that in the long run teaching them to cooperate is better. Children who are taught to cooperate are more likely to become successful, productive members of society.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.; And explain why. The debate over whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has sparked off heated arguments among parents and educators. I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more useful for the development of their social skills, such as understanding, empathy and the ability to solve problems. Moreover, co-operation develops mutual respect and understanding, and this is a necessary foundation for building strong and lasting relationships. Working together towards a common goal enables children to learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which leads to a more cohesive and productive group. This will help them later in life when they are part of a team. In addition, the overemphasis on competition may result in an unhealthy obsession with winning and in the possibility of self-esteem loss, should they encounter any setbacks. In my view, teaching children to compete may lead to the development of an unhealthy individualism. The ability to work together, share ideas and to support each other will help children become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, better able to cope with the complexities of the real world and to play a full part in it. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its merits, I believe that it is more beneficial to teach them to co-operate. In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is the most effective way to produce a generation of compassionate, productive and successful adults.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.; Is it better to teach children to compete or cooperate? This question has been debated in schools and among parents for a long time. I am of the opinion that teaching children to compete is not only more important for their future success, but it is also more conducive to their later development. Cooperation, on the other hand, is more conducive to the formation of a community and mutual respect, which is a pre-requisite for a harmonious and effective society. When children cooperate, they learn to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, and the product they make is more harmonious and more effective, and thus better prepares them for the future world of work. Competition can lead to an indiscriminate desire to win at all costs, a reduction in fairness and the spirit of sportsmanship, and stress and anxiety in children when they lose. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas, and help each other, and they will grow up to be empathetic, tolerant and capable adults who can manage a complex social system. In the end, although competition has its benefits, I think that teaching children to cooperate will bring them more long-term benefits. Cooperation is an essential pre-requisite for the next generation of people who are empathetic, capable, and successful.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities."; Explain your answer. We have been discussing the issue of whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate and I believe that if they are to become useful adults, the former is the better option. Teaching children to cooperate develops the social skills necessary for them to be useful adults. Also, working together and valuing each other’s abilities and limitations fosters mutual respect, which is necessary for the formation of strong relationships. This, in turn, prepares them for the working environment where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. In addition, too much emphasis on competition can lead to unhealthy obsessions with winning at all costs and destroy a sense of fair play and respect for the rules. Conversely, teaching children to compete leads to an unhealthy obsession with their own success, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem if they encounter failure. Cooperation builds a well-rounded, empathetic and productive adult, who is better able to cope with the complexities of life, to build strong relationships and to contribute to society. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to competition, in the long run I believe that teaching children to cooperate will have more benefits. In my opinion, the most important outcome of teaching children to cooperate is to raise a generation of adults with a sense of compassion, understanding and collaboration.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced."; Since the issue of whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has been a matter of much discussion among educators and parents, I would like to suggest that the value of teaching children to work together is much greater. By doing so, they develop such social skills as communication, empathy and the ability to solve problems. Moreover, teamwork encourages a sense of community and mutual respect, which are necessary for building long-lasting relationships. By working together for a common goal, children come to know each other’s abilities and limitations, which helps them to get along better as a group. Also, it enables them to get a feel for the real world where teamwork is essential to success. In contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which may cause them to lose their self-esteem when they fail. As a result, they will grow into well-rounded adults who can deal with the complexities of modern life and build strong relationships. Although there is a place for competition, I think it is better to teach children to work together. And this is a very important thing to do if we want to raise a generation of compassionate, successful people.
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.; In this way, some of the hottest issues that parents and teachers talk about are whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, and not to compete. Cooperation in the early age gives children a wide range of skills such as communication, co-operation, empathy and the ability to solve problems. Cooperation also builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for building strong, lasting relationships. Children can learn from each other, and they can learn the value of their own contribution to the common task. Moreover, a sense of solidarity and a harmonious team are important for later development in society, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, if there is too much competition, children will be encouraged to compete with each other, and this will lead to unhealthy obsessions with winning and a sense of failure and anxiety. Cooperation makes children more cohesive, empathetic, and productive. Later in life, they are better able to navigate the complex social environment, build strong relationships and make positive contributions to their communities. Finally, although competition can be beneficial, I think that teaching children to cooperate will bring greater long-term benefits. Cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance."; Give reasons for your answer. Many educators and parents are discussing whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. Although some argue that competition is the key to success in life, I think it is useful to teach children to co-operate and thus to learn how to co-operate. In addition, co-operation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for building strong and lasting relationships. In the future, when children work together in a team, they will understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this will prepare them for a team-oriented world. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to the selfish thinking of the child, the obsession with winning, and when something goes wrong, stress, anxiety and low self-esteem. To conclude, while there are many advantages to teaching children to compete, it is useful to teach them to co-operate, so that they can develop into well-balanced, productive, kind and empathetic people. For these reasons, I believe that co-operation is the way to a new generation of kind, team-oriented and successful people.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or coexist has led to a great deal of debate between educators and parents. While some believe that learning to compete is necessary for future success, I believe that the child's ability to coexist is more important for the child's future. A sense of community and mutual respect is also essential in building a long-term relationship. In addition, if children learn to work together to achieve a common goal, they will learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, which is very important in the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Children who are taught to compete tend to become too self-conscious and often have a high sense of competition, so when they encounter failures, they will often feel anxious and depressed. As they learn to coexist, they will be able to share ideas, support each other, and work together in the real world, and they will be able to build a good relationship with each other, work well together, and contribute to the community. To conclude, although competition is beneficial, I believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. It is an important factor in raising the next generation of people with a sense of community, sharing, and long-term success.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.; What is your opinion on this matter? One of the issues that have long been debated by teachers and parents is whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some educators argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for them as useful adults. Cooperation fosters mutual respect and admiration, which is necessary for the formation of strong relationships. Children learn to work together to achieve the same goal, and they will learn to value the differences and similarities between each other, so that they will be better able to cope with the difficulties and failures in the future. Cooperation also teaches them not to be selfish, not to be jealous of others, and not to compete, because it leads to a lack of self-esteem and stress when a child fails to win. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy egocentric mentality, so that they put their own success above the success of others, and then become anxious, sad and humiliated when they fail. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas and support each other, so that they will become more useful, well-rounded and empathetic adults, who will have the skills to build strong relationships, work effectively in a team and positively affect their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think teaching children to cooperate is more useful in the long run. Cooperation is an essential tool for raising a compassionate, helpful and successful generation.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run."; Competition and cooperation have always been controversial issues among teachers and parents. Some claim that children should be taught to compete with each other because this will ensure their future success. Others, however, are of the opinion that children who learn to cooperate are more likely to become useful adults. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which are very important for forming lasting friendships. If children work together for the common goal, they can learn to appreciate the virtues of their classmates and the importance of each other’s abilities. Cooperation also increases a child’s self-esteem. On the other hand, competition can lead to a self-centered, overly ambitious, and unhealthy obsession with winning, resulting in self-esteem problems when the child meets with failure. Cooperation also teaches children to share and encourages them to take the lead. This enables them to cope with the complex world and to be good members of society. To sum up, although competition has its advantages, I believe it is more important for children to learn to cooperate with each other. Cooperation is the foundation of a good and happy life.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;" He told us: The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has always been a hot topic of debate among teachers and parents. But the best method is still to combine the two methods. Children work together to achieve a common goal, and understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and cooperate with each other to achieve a common goal, which is more useful and more harmonious, and also teaches children to live in a community of mutual trust and respect, which is the foundation for building lasting friendships and love. Cooperation is the best policy; competition makes children think too much about themselves, which is not only selfish, but also arrogant, but also arrogant, but also makes children unhappy, and it is difficult to develop a healthy and good self-esteem, which is detrimental to their education. Children can share and learn from each other, and the children will become more mature and can think more deeply, and they will also be able to build strong friendships and work together, and have a strong sense of belonging. In short, although there are benefits to competition, I still think that teaching children to cooperate with each other will be more beneficial to children's development. The future of the country is also very important."
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.; The debate between the benefits of teaching children to compete and to co-operate has become a source of serious debate amongst teachers and parents. Whilst some argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial to their future as adults. Teaching children to co-operate helps develop their social skills such as compromising, cooperation, understanding and problem-solving. Co-operation also develops a sense of community and mutual respect, both essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a more cohesive and productive team. This prepares them for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are essential for success. On the other hand, teaching children to compete teaches them to place excessive emphasis on their own success, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, stress, anxiety and a decline in self-esteem when they encounter failure. It also prevents children from learning to work together, share ideas and support each other. By teaching children to co-operate, they will grow into well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, capable of navigating the complexities of the real world and contributing to their communities in a positive manner. To conclude, teaching children to co-operate is essential to their future success and the development of a generation of compassionate, understanding and productive adults.
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has provoked a great deal of debate in schools and in families. There are people who argue that children must be taught to compete if they are to succeed in life. I believe that co-operation helps children to develop important social skills such as negotiating, sharing, understanding and problem-solving. In addition, a sense of community and mutual respect is fostered, which is crucial for building strong, lasting relationships. Children can learn from each other and they can share in each other's success and failure. This can help them to work together in the future, where co-operation and teamwork are important. Besides, a high level of competition can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety, stress and a loss of self-esteem. Teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish and unhealthy focus on one's own achievements, leading to a desire to win at all costs and to a lack of self-respect when one has to fail. From my point of view, the most important thing is that children should be taught to work together, share their ideas and help each other, and then, as they move on to the complexities of adulthood, they will be able to build strong relationships, work well in teams and be useful members of society. In conclusion, although there are advantages to competition, I think that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. There are a number of reasons why children should be taught to co-operate rather than to compete. Teaching children to co-operate rather than to compete will produce a generation of people who are able to work well together and to get on with each other.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.; If you teach children to co-operate with each other, you can help them develop the social skills necessary for solving problems and for maintaining peaceful relationships. Educators and parents have long argued about whether it is better to teach children to compete or to cooperate, and many still feel the former is more advantageous in the long run. Cooperation, on the other hand, creates a sense of community and respect for others, which is vital for building a lasting relationship. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, and this can help them to become effective members of a team in later life. In addition, the emphasis on competition can lead to unhealthy pressure on children to achieve success at any cost, and they may lose sight of the importance of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can foster an unhealthy emphasis on self-interest, and this can lead to a fixation on winning, which can lead to disappointment, depression and self-esteem issues if things don’t go their way. Cooperation can help children develop the skills needed to negotiate the world as adults: they learn to share ideas and support each other. They will be more able to build up relationships with others, to work together effectively, and to be productive members of society. In conclusion, although there are advantages to both teaching children to compete and to cooperate, I believe that the latter is more beneficial in the long run. It is the only way to raise a generation of people who are compassionate, capable of working together, and successful.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.; Do you think that children should be allowed to do any kind of paid work? The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has long been the subject of debate among parents and educators. I am firmly convinced that the teaching of cooperation is much more beneficial for the child in the long run, than the teaching of competition. Cooperation teaches children to communicate, to negotiate, to share, to sympathize, and to solve problems together. Cooperation also instills in them a sense of commonality and mutual respect, which is of the utmost importance in establishing strong and lasting friendships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to recognize each other’s abilities and limitations, and this, in turn, creates a harmonious and productive team. Competition, on the other hand, can result in unhealthy obsession with success, stress, and anxiety when they do not achieve it, and in the long run, it can affect their self-esteem. As they mature, children who learn to cooperate will become more empathetic, more tolerant, and more capable of establishing strong, lasting relationships, and a more productive, contributing member of society. In conclusion, although there are many advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that in the long run, the benefits of cooperation far outweigh the disadvantages. Ultimately, teaching children to cooperate is vital to raising a compassionate, empathetic, and successful adult.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.; Competition or cooperation has long been a topic of discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in preparing them to become useful adults. Cooperation is essential for building strong and lasting relationships, and cooperation also helps children to understand the importance of respecting each other’s differences. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s skills and weaknesses, which in turn makes them a more harmonious and productive team. In the real world, where teamwork and cooperation are highly valued, this understanding can be invaluable. On the other hand, teaching children to compete teaches them to focus only on their own success, which can lead to a lack of self-confidence and a tendency to view everything in a negative light. Cooperation helps children to become more rounded, empathetic and productive adults, who are better able to navigate the complexities of the real world and build strong relationships, collaborate on projects and contribute to their communities. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete can be beneficial, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will ultimately be more beneficial. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of successful, empathetic and productive adults.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.; It is a controversial issue among parents and educators whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate. While some argue that competition is more important for the future of the child, others believe that children who are taught to work together as children are more useful as adults. Cooperation teaches children to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, and they will be more productive in their later life in a situation where teamwork is appreciated. Moreover, the atmosphere of competition can be unhealthy, in which the child is forced to succeed at all costs, and they will become more anxious and less able to cope with disappointments. On the other hand, competition leads to a focus on the individual and a tendency to put their own success above the success of others. Competition also causes them to worry more than they should, and to experience anxiety and self-esteem problems if they are unable to achieve what they want. By working together, sharing ideas and helping each other, children develop into a well-balanced, empathetic and productive adult. This means that they are better able to deal with the complexity of adult life and build strong relationships, work effectively as a team and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, it is better to teach children to cooperate for their future. I think it's important for children to learn to cooperate with each other, so that they can become more successful, productive and empathetic adults.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.; “There has been a lot of discussion in the last few years about whether or not children should be taught to compete or to work together. Some people say that competition is the key to success in life, but I don’t think so. I believe that it is much better to teach children to work together because it teaches them many necessary skills for life, such as sharing, negotiating, understanding, and problem-solving. In addition, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect that is very important in building a strong and lasting relationship. Working together teaches children to understand and appreciate the weaknesses and strengths of others. Competition, on the other hand, teaches children to put themselves first, and to worry and worry if they don’t succeed. It also makes children lose sight of the importance of fairness and sportsmanship. Competition makes children lose their sense of community and of respect for others. In short, cooperation can produce more harmonious and successful adults, capable of building strong relationships, and working in groups, and contributing positively to the community. Although competition also has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is, therefore, the best way to educate future generations of people who are caring, cooperative, and successful.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects."; I strongly believe that by teaching children to co-operate, they will be able to learn the basic skills of communication, empathy, and problem solving. There has been a long-standing debate about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate. Basically, co-operation can help children to learn to work in a group and to respect each other’s different ideas and opinions. This, in turn, prepares them for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are rewarded. In contrast, too much emphasis on competition can create an unhealthy obsession with winning, thereby eroding their self-esteem and self-confidence. Having learned to co-operate, share ideas, and help each other, children will become well-rounded, empathetic, and productive members of society. In conclusion, although competition has its own merits, it is better to encourage children to work together. As a result, the next generation will be more compassionate, collaborative, and successful.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.; For example, some parents and teachers think that children should be taught to compete rather than to co-operate, but I disagree. I believe that if you teach children to co-operate you are laying in them a strong foundation for their future life as adults. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect which helps to build strong, long-lasting relationships. Besides, if children work together they can understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a better, more harmonious and more productive team. And this is a valuable lesson for their future life, when in the real world a strong teamwork is a highly valued thing. For the same reason competition teaches a child to think only of his own success, which in turn can make him selfish, more prone to worry, to a bad temper and to lack of self-confidence when he fails. On the other hand, competition teaches children to be selfish, to put their own success before that of others. This attitude can lead to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they fail. It is my belief that by learning to work together, sharing ideas and helping each other, children will grow up to be better people, better prepared to build strong relationships and build teams that can work together and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, although there are benefits to competition, I think that in the long run it is better to teach children to co-operate. This will produce a generation of compassionate, capable and successful people.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.; Having to choose between whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has caused much debate amongst parents and teachers. I believe that, contrary to the views of those who argue that learning to compete is the best way to ensure success later in life, the opposite is true: that encouraging children to cooperate is better for them. It gives them social skills, like listening, empathy, problem solving and so on. Cooperation also helps them to develop a sense of community and respect for one another which will serve them well in the real world, where teamwork is highly valued. Also, encouraging competition amongst children can make them so highly competitive that they lose all sense of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, encouraging children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to a lack of self-esteem, stress and anxiety when they fail to win. Cooperation develops well-rounded, empathetic, and productive people. Cooperation enables them to negotiate the complexities of the real world with greater ease, build and maintain relationships and be more productive members of their communities. In conclusion, though there are advantages to both competition and cooperation, I think that in the long run cooperation is more beneficial. The world needs more people who are compassionate, caring, and cooperative.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.; Discuss. Should children be taught to compete or to co-operate? A debate between teachers and parents is ongoing as to whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. On the one hand, some teachers argue that children should be taught to compete in order to help them learn how to deal with difficulties. On the other hand, they believe that children should be taught to co-operate in order to encourage them to develop an appreciation of the different abilities of others and to foster in them a respect for and a sense of solidarity with their fellow human beings. Also, a tendency to stress competition can create a cut-throat atmosphere where children feel the pressure to win at any cost and this can cause a decrease in their self-esteem when they fail. On the other hand, the emphasis on competition can make children too selfish and lead them to be obsessed with winning, which can lead to stress and anxiety and a decrease in their self-esteem. Cooperation is a more positive, empathetic and productive approach, which can also help children as they become adults to learn how to establish strong working relationships and give their full potential in the future. In conclusion, it seems to me that the long-term benefits of teaching children to co-operate outweigh the benefits of teaching them to compete. Cooperation is the only way to ensure that future generations of children grow up to be empathetic, co-operative and successful.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.; I think that a lot of children are taught to compete and that this is very important for their future success, but I believe that children should be taught to coexist. Coexistence develops a lot of social skills such as communication, empathy and problem solving. Moreover, coexistence creates a feeling of community and mutual respect, which is very important for long-lasting relationships. The most important thing is that children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses and that is the foundation for teamwork and collaboration in the real world. Competition on the other hand, instills in children an overly individualistic attitude where they want to succeed for their own sake, which causes an unhealthy obsession with winning and in the end can lead to depression, stress and lowered self-esteem. By teaching children to coexist, children develop into more mature, better educated, more empathic and successful adults, who will be better able to build relationships, work in teams and develop positively in society. In my opinion, competition is a good thing, but teaching children to coexist will benefit them more in the long run. In conclusion, teaching children to coexist is the best way to create a compassionate, cooperative and successful society.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life."; Give reasons for your answer. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has become an important subject of discussion among parents and teachers. Some people think that if children are taught to compete, they will be more successful in the future, but I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is the best way to help them become useful adults. Cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect that makes people work together and trust each other, and is also a good lesson for them in the future. Cooperation is also useful in the real world, where teamwork is highly valued. Competition can also cause a more vicious environment where children are forced to win at any cost, and unfairness and good sportsmanship are often forgotten. Teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy individualism, making them put their own success above all else, and stress, anxiety and self-esteem can result from the fact that they lose. Cooperation makes children more caring, more successful, more well-rounded, and better able to cope with the complexities of life and contribute to society. In conclusion, while there is a benefit to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate has long-term benefits. Cooperation will ultimately help children become more compassionate, cooperative and successful adults.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.; This issue has been a matter of great debate among educators and parents, and while some argue that competition is the only way to make children future-ready, I think the other way round – namely, that teaching them co-operation is more useful for their future development as useful, responsible citizens. I say this because teaching children to cooperate enables them to develop essential social skills like cooperation, communication, understanding, and problem-solving. As a result, they are better prepared for the working world, where the value of co-operation is a key part of the curriculum. Moreover, it makes children more empathetic and appreciative of others’ skills and achievements, and so builds stronger relationships between them. However, a school which places too much emphasis on competition fosters a cut-throat environment in which the child is pushed to succeed at all costs, and where the value of fairness and sportsmanship is neglected. Teaching children to compete can make them too selfish, so that they become obsessed with winning at all costs, which may lead to stress, depression and low self-esteem. Cooperation, on the other hand, encourages children to share ideas, and to support each other, which develops a better appreciation of the achievements of others. In my opinion, a good citizen is not only someone who has the ability to succeed but also someone who can work effectively with others to build good relationships and contribute to society. Co-operation is the key to success, and we need to teach it to our children.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.; The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has led to many discussions between parents and educators. While some people argue that competition is good for children’s future success, I believe that cooperation is more important for bringing up responsible adults. Cooperation is a way of working together to achieve common goals, which in turn teaches children to work together and share in future work situations. Cooperation also teaches children how to recognize the value of others and the importance of their ideas. If competition is overemphasized, it can create an environment where children are under pressure to win at all costs, and fair play and a sense of sportsmanship are forgotten. On the other hand, competition can lead to a selfish attitude towards others and cause stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem in the face of failure. Cooperation teaches children to share, and children who learn to share and cooperate become responsible, helpful adults who are able to build up relationships and work in a team to achieve success. In conclusion, while there are some advantages to competition, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is the best way of bringing up children to be helpful, kind and successful.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.; The debate whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has become an issue of much discussion among educators and parents. It is generally agreed that teaching children to compete is necessary for future success. But I would like to argue that teaching children to co-operate will help them develop more essential skills for their future lives such as communication, tolerance, cooperation, and problem-solving. Co-operation is also necessary for building and maintaining strong and lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s differences and weaknesses, which leads to a more harmonious and productive team. As a result of a strong emphasis on competition, children may feel a strong pressure to succeed at any cost, which will lead to a lack of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which will lead to depression, stress, and low self-esteem when they encounter failure. When children learn to work together and share ideas, they will become more responsible and productive members of society. I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. In conclusion, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is essential for raising a more compassionate, cohesive, and successful generation.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.; What skills do children develop if they are taught to cooperate rather than compete? This issue has been the subject of heated discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I would argue that teaching children to cooperate is a more effective way of preparing them to be useful members of society. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which are necessary for building long-lasting relationships. Moreover, when children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s abilities, and the group is more cohesive and productive. In the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are viewed as essential, this is useful preparation. Further, overemphasizing competition can create a cutthroat atmosphere where the only way to succeed is to win, thus eroding the concept of fair play. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may grow up to be too selfish and become preoccupied with their own success. They may become irritable, frustrated, and prone to resent others if they encounter setbacks. Cooperation, on the other hand, enables children to become well-rounded, empathetic, and hardworking adults who are better able to negotiate the complexities of the real world and contribute to society. In conclusion, I believe that although competition has its merits, teaching children to cooperate is a more effective long-term strategy. Cooperation is the key to raising a compassionate, hardworking, and successful generation.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system."; Discuss both sides and give your own opinion. Educators and parents are divided over whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. Some claim that only by encouraging competition can they be properly prepared for future life. I believe that by encouraging cooperation we give them an important social advantage. Co-operation builds up a sense of community and mutual respect, both of which are essential to the development of good relationships. When children are allowed to work together they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this will help them to succeed in future life, where collaboration and co-operation are prized. A heavy emphasis on competition creates an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can result in a feeling of depression, stress, and low self-esteem. On the other hand, competition can make children too individualistic, encouraging them to focus on their own successes at the expense of others. Children who learn to share ideas, help each other, and work together, will be better able to cope with the difficulties of real life. Moreover, they will be better able to build strong relationships, work as a team, and contribute to their local communities. In my opinion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. In fact, it is the only way to raise a generation of successful, well-adjusted, and empathetic adults.
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.; These days there is a lively debate among educators and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. I would like to suggest that children should be taught to cooperate, because this will help them to develop social skills such as cooperation, tolerance and problem-solving. In addition, cooperative learning develops mutual respect, which is the foundation for a long-term relationship. If children learn to work together, they will learn to appreciate each other’s differences and they will be more effective in working as a team. This will help them to face the challenges of the real world, where the ability to work together as a team is highly valued. Children who are taught to compete are often too focused on their own success. They often become anxious and stressed when they encounter difficulties and their self-esteem is damaged. Children who are taught to cooperate will be able to develop into adults who are well-balanced, empathetic and capable of being productive members of society. In conclusion, although there are benefits to be gained from both competition and cooperation, I would suggest that cooperation is the better option. The best way to teach children to be empathetic, to work well with others and to be successful is to teach them to cooperate.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.; Opinions on the question of whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate have become the subject of great controversy among parents and educators. Some claim that the ability to compete is the only one that can make a child successful in the future. In my opinion, however, children must be taught to co-operate, so that they can develop important social skills such as communication, understanding and the ability to solve problems. In addition, co-operation builds a strong sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for the formation of lasting relationships. When children work together for the same goal, they learn to appreciate the differences in their abilities and thus form a harmonious and more productive group. Also, competition in schools can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning and the lack of fairness and sportsmanship. Teaching children to compete leads to a highly individualistic approach to life, where they put their success above the success of others, and if they fail, they feel a sense of failure and humiliation. Co-operation develops children into empathetic, responsible and successful people who, as they enter adulthood, will have the skills to work together, form strong relationships and contribute to society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that co-operation is the most beneficial for children. Children need to be taught to co-operate if we want them to become empathetic, co-operative and successful adults.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.; Teaching children to compete with one another or to work together is a topic of heated debate amongst educators and parents. Some believe that competition is the most effective way of preparing them for life, while others argue that co-operation is the best way to make them into useful adults. And they also teach them to respect each other, which is essential for building strong relationships. Moreover, when children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s skills and weaknesses, which will be useful for them in later life. Besides, the competitive spirit can also undermine the importance of fair play and the spirit of good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy emphasis on winning, which can be devastating to their self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. In my view, by learning to work together and support each other, children develop into well-rounded, empathetic adults who can build strong relationships, work well in teams, and contribute to their communities. In conclusion, I think that although teaching children to compete can have its advantages, the more beneficial approach is to teach them to work together. This is the best way to ensure that the next generation is compassionate, hard-working, and successful.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.; In my opinion, it is not only important for the children to learn to compete, but also to learn to cooperate. Cooperation is important for children to learn communication skills, empathy, and the ability to solve problems. In addition, cooperation encourages mutual respect, which is necessary for the formation of close and long-term relationships. When children cooperate in order to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their team, which, in turn, makes them better prepared for the real world where teamwork and teamwork are valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to a highly individualistic and unhealthy attitude towards winning. It can also lead to stress, anxiety and a loss of self-esteem when it encounters failure. Cooperation, on the other hand, helps children to learn to share ideas, support each other, and work together. When they go out into the world, they will be able to build stronger relationships, work more effectively in a team, and positively contribute to society. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, tolerant, and successful people.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.; I believe the schools should teach children to work together, not to compete with each other. Some people think that teaching children to compete is better for their future success, but I am sure that teaching them to work together is more beneficial for their future lives. For one thing, when people work together they learn to respect each other. And this makes them better prepared for the work world where they have to work together. For another thing, a system of competition teaches them that they must win at all costs, which can make them lose sight of fair play. And finally, competition teaches them to be selfish, so they can be hurt and humiliated when they do not succeed. The children who learn to work together are better prepared for the complexities of the real world, where they have to work in groups and make decisions together. In conclusion, although competition has some advantages, I think it is better for children to learn to work together. Certainly, a society must have individuals who are capable of working together.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.; It is a controversial topic amongst parents and educators: should children be taught to compete or cooperate? Some argue that to teach children to compete is the way to prepare them for a successful future, but I disagree. Cooperation can teach children to develop essential social skills such as communication, cooperation, sympathy and problem-solving. Also, cooperation can develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which are important to build long-lasting friendships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues, and thereby become better able to work as a team. In the real world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued, this can prepare children for the real world. In addition, too much competition can lead to a cutthroat environment in which children feel forced to succeed, and there is no room for sportsmanship and fairness. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish attitude in which the personal success is put above all others. The individual who has to face defeat is likely to suffer stress, anxiety and a drop in self-esteem. Cooperation can teach children to share ideas, work together and help each other, and in this way they will develop into more mature, compassionate and helpful adults. In the end, although there are some benefits of teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to cooperate has more long-term benefits. Cooperation is essential for the development of successful, compassionate and effective adults.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;" Cooperation and competition have long been controversial subjects for teachers and parents. Some argue that cooperation is more important for future success; others that cooperation is the way to develop social skills such as communication, empathy and problem-solving. I believe that the way we raise children today is to emphasize cooperation more than competition and children today are capable of doing both effectively. Cooperation fosters community and mutual respect, which is essential for the formation of lasting and deep relationships. When children cooperate in the same activity, they can see each other's strengths and weaknesses, which in turn leads to the establishment of a healthy and productive team. Then the children can learn to build trust, and when something goes wrong, they can comfort each other. When it comes to competition, children can develop a selfish and unhealthy attitude towards others, which can lead to stress and anxiety, which may cause them to lose self-esteem when they are disadvantaged. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas, support each other, and grow into more empathetic and successful adults. As they mature, they are better able to build relationships, work in a group, and build a community. Cooperation is the key to raising a new generation of people who are empathetic, cooperative, and successful."
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence."; Question: Whether it is a good idea to teach children to compete or to cooperate? Although some people argue that teaching children to compete is more beneficial in the long run, I personally believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in making them responsible and productive adults. Cooperation instills a sense of unity and mutual respect, which is necessary for a strong and long-lasting relationship. Cooperation is more advantageous in a world where teams and collaboration are highly valued. In addition, competition can create an environment where children feel pressured to succeed at all costs, which is incompatible with fairness and sportsmanship. However, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which causes anxiety, stress and lack of self-esteem in the face of failure. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas and support each other, which is important in making them well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who can build strong relationships, work well with others and contribute positively to society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. It is important for raising a generation of successful, empathetic and productive adults.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.; Discuss both views and give your own opinion. The debate over whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has caused a great deal of discussion among educators and parents. While some claim that competition is essential to the child's future success, I strongly disagree. I believe that teaching cooperation is more useful for a useful adult. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to the development of a strong, lasting relationship. When children cooperate, they learn to appreciate the differences in their strengths and weaknesses, thereby forming a harmonious and productive team, which in turn will benefit them in the real world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Cooperation also emphasizes the concept of fairness and the importance of courtesy. On the other hand, teaching children to compete often leads to a selfish mindset in which the success of one individual is valued over others. This can lead to a desire for self-interest, stress, anxiety, and a sense of failure, which can be detrimental to the development of self-esteem and self-esteem. Cooperation leads to the formation of a mature, well-rounded, responsible, and productive adult, who is capable of building relationships, working as a team, and making a positive contribution to the community. In short, while competition also has its benefits, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is essential to raising a generation of children who are compassionate, kind, and successful.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.; While some people think that teaching children to compete is important for their future, I think that teaching children to cooperate is better for their future because they can develop social skills such as listening, communication, empathy, and solving problems. Cooperation can develop a sense of community and mutual respect that is critical to building strong, long-lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they will be able to know the advantages and disadvantages of their own strength and ability, which can lead to more harmony and efficiency. In the future, they will be able to value the same kind of work in a group, which will also prepare them for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. A school environment that is too competitive will also lead to unhealthy competition and competition, and children will not learn to value fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete, they will be too self-centered and selfish, and they will only think about how to win, and they will be afraid of failure and they will not have self-esteem. Cooperation can help children become more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, and they will be able to develop the skills of relationship building, working together effectively, and contributing to the development of society. In summary, although competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is important for raising a generation of children who are empathetic, cooperative, and successful.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.; In your essay, explain why you think you are right or wrong. The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has aroused much debate among teachers and parents. Many people believe that a culture of competition is essential for the children's future success, but I believe that a culture of cooperation is more useful for them in the future. Co-operation also encourages the feeling of community and mutual respect, which is the foundation for long-term friendships. It also prepares children for the adult world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing anxiety, stress and reduced self-esteem in the face of setbacks. On the other hand, teaching children to compete encourages them to set excessively high goals for themselves, so that they can become stressed and anxious and, as a result, have a reduced self-esteem when they experience difficulties. In the future, this may make it difficult for them to build relationships and work in teams. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in the long run. To develop a culture of cooperation in schools is the most effective way to raise a generation of compassionate, tolerant and successful people.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.; Your answer should be about four hundred words in length. A debate between parents and teachers about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has raged for many years. I believe that children should be taught to cooperate, as I think it is much more useful for them to be future useful people. Cooperation teaches children to respect one another and to be united with each other, and it prepares them for a later life, when cooperation is a very important thing. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which is very important for the harmony of the team and future co-operation. In addition, an emphasis on competition creates a cutthroat environment in which the child feels under pressure to win at all costs, which in turn damages the value of fair play and the spirit of co-operation. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads them to an unhealthy obsession with their own success and causes them many worries, increased stress and lowered self-esteem when they have failures. Moreover, by learning to work together, share ideas and support each other, children develop into more mature, empathetic and helpful adults, capable of dealing with the complexities of real life, building good relationships, working together effectively and contributing to the well-being of their communities. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, in the long run it is more beneficial for children to be taught to co-operate. To my mind, children who have learned to co-operate are more likely to be empathetic, united and successful in life.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.; The controversy over whether children should be taught to compete or coexist has long been a topic of debate among parents and teachers. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I am of the opinion that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial to their future development. Coexistence can help children develop necessary social skills such as communication, understanding and problem-solving. Coexistence also helps children build a sense of community and mutual respect which is important in building long-lasting relationships. When children work together to accomplish a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and this can make them a more effective and productive team. A greater emphasis on competition, on the other hand, can lead to unhealthy obsessions with winning and the loss of the value of fairness and fair play. The teaching of competition to children can make them overly individualistic and they may focus too much on their own success. They may also be overwhelmed by stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. Children who learn to coexist are more likely to become mature, empathetic and productive adults. When they become adults, they will be better able to deal with the complexities of the real world and make valuable contributions to their communities. In conclusion, although both coexistence and competition have their own merits, I think that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial to their future development. Coexistence is a necessary life skill in raising children who will be compassionate, cooperative and successful.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.; To help children learn to work together, it develops in them social skills such as communication, understanding, and problem-solving. Although the question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been debated by many parents and educators, some say that competition is the best way for children to succeed in the future, but I firmly believe that it is more important for children to learn to work together to help each other. In addition, working together develops mutual respect and tolerance, and this will be a great help for children to learn in the future. Cooperation, like learning, can be achieved in many different ways, but the most important thing is that it can be understood and achieved by children in their early years, which can also be seen as the foundation of their life and friendship. However, if you teach children to compete, they will have a tendency to be selfish, which can lead to a strong desire to win, which is very unhealthy, which can lead to self-esteem. Children who learn to work together, share their ideas, and support each other will grow into adults who are empathetic, strong, and can contribute to the community. In my opinion, although there is a benefit to children learning to compete, I think teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. Ultimately, children should be taught to work together to help them become more empathetic, more cooperative, and more successful.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned."; Whether it is right to teach children to compete or to work together is an issue that has been discussed for a long time by parents and educators. While some argue that competition is the best way to teach children for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to work together will be more useful in helping them become useful adults. As well as developing teamwork, cooperation also develops a sense of community and mutual respect. When children learn to work together, they learn to understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses and then can come together and perform better. In addition, the concept of working together has a future in the professional world where cooperation and teamwork are valued. Competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success and failure, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to the development of an unhealthy individualistic tendency in which success is valued above all else. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other will be more well-rounded, empathetic and useful adults, and will be better able to manage the complexities of life, work effectively in teams and help the community. In short, although competition has its advantages, it is my view that teaching children to work together will benefit them more in the long run. Children need to learn to work together if we are to raise a new generation of cooperative, kind and successful people.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.; I think the way children are taught to compete and cooperate can be a very important thing in determining how they develop in the future. Children who learn to compete are usually told that they will be more successful in the future. I believe that children who learn to cooperate are better able to develop social skills, such as communication, the ability to empathize with others and the ability to solve problems. In addition, they develop mutual respect, and that is an important factor in building strong, long-term relationships. Children working together to achieve a common goal are able to understand each other's abilities and weaknesses, and can therefore produce more harmonious and better-functioning teams. Children who are taught to compete, on the other hand, are often more individualistic, they are not afraid of failure, and they are too focused on winning, and this leads to unhealthy stress and self-esteem if they are unable to achieve their goals. In addition, competition can lead to a stress-filled attitude, to an unhealthy obsession with winning, and to a reduction in self-esteem if they fail. Cooperation and the ability to work together, share ideas and help each other are the most effective way to learn, and the children will grow up to be more sympathetic and more productive people. Cooperation has its own advantages, but the final result is better if children learn to cooperate. It is therefore necessary to teach children to cooperate, so as to bring up a generation of sympathetic, cooperative and successful people.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible."; This topic has long been a subject of debate between parents and educators. Some claim that children must be taught to compete for success, while others feel that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial. The benefits of cooperation are a better way of life and a more desirable way of being. Cooperation teaches respect and builds a foundation for trust. Cooperation also allows children to experience the differences between them and the understanding that there is strength in numbers. Lastly, cooperation creates an environment where everyone can learn from everyone else and this prepares them for a work environment where they must work together to achieve common goals. Cooperation also instills the idea that no one is better than anyone else and that fairness and honesty are just as important as winning. Competition, on the other hand, teaches children to value personal success over success for others, which in turn leads to an unhealthy obsession with winning, resulting in anxiety, depression and lowered self-esteem when they fail. Competition also teaches children to judge others by their abilities rather than their achievements. By contrast, children who learn to work together, share ideas and support one another, grow into well-rounded, productive and successful adults, capable of establishing and maintaining strong personal and professional relationships and contributing positively to society. In my opinion, while teaching children to compete has its benefits, in the long run, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial. Cooperation, as opposed to competition, is the basis for a more compassionate and more successful generation.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.; This debate has become an issue for educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is more important for their future success, I strongly believe that teaching children to cooperate is a better way to help them grow up to be responsible adults. Cooperation develops trust and respect, which is important in establishing long-lasting relationships. Children, by working together on a common task, learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and as a result they work together more effectively. In addition, if competition is over-emphasized, children may lose their sense of fair play and sportsmanship. They may become too focused on their own success, become anxious, and suffer from low self-esteem if they lose. Cooperation, on the other hand, enables children to learn from each other’s mistakes and to support each other’s efforts. As a result, they are better able to cope with the complexities of life as adults, building good relationships and achieving success through teamwork. In conclusion, while competition does have its benefits, teaching children to cooperate has a greater advantage in the long run. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is essential if we want to raise a generation of compassionate, caring, and successful individuals.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has always been controversial among educators and parents. While some believe that the purpose of competition is to train them for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate will make them more useful in adulthood. Cooperation develops mutual respect and trust, which is the foundation of building lasting relationships. Children working together to achieve a common goal will learn to appreciate the differences between them, and will eventually achieve a more harmonious and productive group. Cooperation also teaches them to be fair and not to compete unfairly, which will make them more resilient to setbacks. Whereas competition can make children more selfish and competitive, which will make them obsessed with their own success, and when they encounter obstacles, they will become more anxious and self-conscious. Cooperation makes children more mature, empathetic and practical. As they grow up and enter the real world, they will be better able to build strong relationships, work well with others and contribute to society. Cooperation may have its advantages, but in the long run it will make children more useful. Cooperation will also make them more successful.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves."; A lot of argument has gone on over the question of whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. Some people think competition is the best way of teaching children how to be successful in life. I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in helping them to become good and useful adults. Co-operation is the best way of teaching children to get along with each other and respect each other, and to learn how to work together with others when they become adults. It makes children ready for a career in the adult world where the ability to work as a team is highly regarded. Competition teaches children to put their own interests first, and to be selfish and ambitious for personal success at the expense of others. It makes children obsessed with the need to win and it is not a good idea to encourage them to worry, to be anxious and to be very disappointed when they fail. By learning to share, to work together and to support each other, children learn to be empathetic and helpful adults, and when they grow up to face the problems of the real world, they are able to work together and make a contribution. In conclusion, though competition has some advantages, I think that it is better for children to be taught to work together. In the end, it is more useful to teach children to work together, because it makes them more sympathetic, more helpful and successful.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.; and discuss your reasons for it. This topic is a subject of great debate among parents and educators. While some argue that competition is the only way to success, I believe that children must learn to work together if they are to become responsible, active members of society. Cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to forming strong, long-lasting relationships. Also, children learn from working together to be more appreciative of the abilities and limitations of others, which in turn leads to a more cohesive, productive team. Moreover, too much emphasis on competition can lead to a cutthroat attitude where children feel compelled to succeed at any cost, thus undermining the importance of fair play and good sportsmanship. By contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to a highly individualistic outlook where their success is measured against the success of others, causing them to experience feelings of frustration, anger and low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation teaches children to share, cooperate and respect the differences between people, thereby making them more empathetic and productive members of society who are better able to deal with the complexities of real life. In conclusion, I believe that while competition has its benefits, cooperation is the more important in the long run. Cooperation is the only way to raise a compassionate, team-oriented, and successful generation.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.; So it seems to me that the question whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate is the most important issue in the school and has been an issue for discussion. There are some people who think that teaching children to compete is the best way to make them good adults. Cooperation in school will not only be the foundation for building strong and lasting relationships, but also teaches children to respect each other and feel a sense of community. Cooperation in school also teaches children to appreciate their weaknesses and strengths, so they are able to work together effectively and produce good results. This will also prepare them for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are valued. Besides, if competition is allowed to dominate the whole of education, children will be under great pressure to succeed and will lose the value of fair play and sportsmanship. Teaching children to compete can lead to a too individualistic attitude, where the success of one individual is more important than the success of others. This can lead to problems with self-esteem and anxiety when children fail. As children learn to work together, share ideas and help each other, they will grow into more capable, empathetic and productive adults. In conclusion, while competition has its advantages, I believe that children are more likely to benefit from being taught to cooperate. Ultimately, we need to raise a generation of people who are compassionate, team-oriented and successful.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.; To compete or to co-operate? There is a controversy about the debate of whether to teach children to compete or to co-operate. Many teachers and parents feel that the latter would be more beneficial for the child’s future. Co-operation creates a sense of community and mutual respect which is very important for long-lasting relationships. When children work together for the same purpose they learn to appreciate the value of co-operation. To compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning and a low self-esteem when the child fails. On the other hand, children who are taught to compete can be individualistic, and they can be too preoccupied with their own success, which can lead to self-doubt and lack of self-esteem. It is more beneficial for children to learn to work together, share ideas and help each other, so that they become more capable and empathetic as they grow up, enabling them to deal more successfully with the complications of the adult world. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that it is more beneficial to teach children to co-operate. To teach children to co-operate is essential for raising a generation of empathetic, co-operative and successful people.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.; Your opinion about this matter is very important to me. We are very much involved in the teaching of children in the field of competition and cooperation. Many educators and parents believe that children must be taught to compete because it is important for their future success. I, however, strongly disagree with this view and consider that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation builds trust and mutual respect, which is an important foundation for building strong relationships and cooperation in the future. When children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this prepares them for the world of work, where the work of teams is appreciated. And competition can be a very unhealthy obsession with success, which leads to stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem in the face of setbacks. On the other hand, competition can lead to an overly individualistic mindset in children, where their own success is more important than the success of others. When children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, they become well-rounded, empathetic and more productive adults who are better able to build strong relationships, work in teams and contribute to the welfare of society. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I think that teaching children to cooperate will ultimately be more beneficial. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs."; Cooperation and competition have always been topics of heated debate among parents and teachers. Some people argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, while others hold that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in making them useful adults. Cooperation teaches people to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which in turn promotes teamwork and encourages closer relationships among members of the team. This in turn prepares children for the real world, where working together as a team is highly valued. Cooperation also promotes a positive attitude towards achieving success without undermining the importance of fair play and sportsmanship. Teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy emphasis on the value of personal success, which can lead to a lack of self-confidence, depression and anxiety if the child does not succeed. Cooperation develops more rounded, empathetic and productive adults, better able to cope with the complexity of the real world, to build stronger relationships, to work in a team and to contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think that teaching children to cooperate will ultimately prove more useful. Cooperation is essential in developing a generation of successful, empathetic, team-oriented adults.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.; Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Cooperation or competition is the basic question that is debated by many parents and educators. Some believe that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, but I am firmly convinced that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for their future development. Cooperation can also enhance a sense of belonging and mutual respect that can be very helpful for building strong relationships. The real world is very much about working in a group. A too strong emphasis on competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning at all costs, which can lead to frustration, low self-esteem and stress when children fail. Cooperation develops a well-rounded, empathetic and successful adult. It enables children to work effectively in a team and to contribute more to society. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation is more useful for children in the long run. Cooperation is essential to the development of a compassionate, team-orientated and successful society.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.; Some parents and educators argue that children should be taught to compete rather than to cooperate. Others disagree and say that teaching children to cooperate is more important for their future success. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is an essential basis for building long-term friendships. In addition, a ruthless competition can lead to unfair competition and a lack of fairness, and can also lead to a solitary and obtrusive aversion to success and a loss of self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with individual success and lead to a loss of self-esteem and depression when they fail. Cooperation develops children who are more well-rounded, more compassionate and more capable of coping with the complexities of real life. Finally, although there are some benefits to competition, I believe that cooperation has more long-term benefits for children. Cooperation is an important way to raise successful and compassionate people.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.; For this task you can use the example: Amongst the pedagogues and parents there is a long-standing debate on whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. While some claim that teaching children to compete is essential to future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to co-operate is more effective in forming useful and successful citizens. Furthermore, co-operation encourages a feeling of community and mutual respect, which is important for building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal they learn to appreciate each other’s differences, and the result is a more harmonious and more productive team. In this way they will be better prepared for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. In contrast, teaching children to compete instils in them a very individualistic attitude, making them place their own success above all else. In addition, competition can foster a very unhealthy obsession with winning, leading to problems with self-esteem and mental health when they fail. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support one another, will grow up to be well-rounded, empathetic, productive and useful citizens. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete has its merits, I firmly believe that in the long run it is more beneficial to teach them to co-operate. In this way we will raise a generation of successful, kind and caring citizens.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent."; (In my opinion, this issue has become a frequent source of debate between teachers and parents.) Whether it is better to teach children to compete or co-operate has long been a topic of controversy between them. In my opinion, children must be taught to co-operate because, I believe, it is more useful for them to develop useful life skills. This also prepares them for a future life, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. By working together towards a common goal, children learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their peers, and their work together is more harmonious and productive. In addition, competition can lead to a demanding attitude towards success, and unfair competition, which undermines the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can lead to an egotistical attitude, and a self-centred focus on winning at all costs, which can cause stress, anxiety and low self-esteem. By learning to work together, share ideas, and help each other, children will grow up to be more rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. Children need to be taught to work together in order to develop their skills and prepare them for the future.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.; If you want to give a view on this, explain why you think so. The debate about whether it is good for children to be taught to compete or to cooperate has been an issue of debate between teachers and parents for a long time. While some people say that children must be taught to compete in order to become successful adults, I am convinced that the opposite is true. Cooperation is, in my opinion, the best way to bring children together in a strong community and mutual respect. Cooperation in the classroom teaches children to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and it also makes them ready for the future world where collaboration and teamwork are highly appreciated. In addition, an environment where competition is emphasized can also lead to an unhealthy concern for winning, which can cause a sense of failure and loss of self-esteem when you are unsuccessful. In contrast, competition leads to a sense of individuality in the children who learn to compete, where they themselves set their success as the highest value and put themselves before others. Cooperation teaches children to help each other and share ideas, and this makes them better equipped to cope with the complex world and to be able to work together effectively and help others in the future. To sum up, I think that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial than teaching them to compete. Cooperation is a prerequisite for the development of a generation of people who are sympathetic, helpful and successful.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent."; Cooperation teaches children important social skills like communication, listening, empathy, and problem solving. The debate between teaching children to compete and to cooperate has raised a lot of debate among parents and educators. While some believe that teaching children to compete is more important for future success, I disagree and think that teaching children to cooperate will make them useful adults. Cooperation teaches children how to work in a team and how to respect each other, which makes them better prepared for the working world, where collaboration and teamwork are extremely important. Moreover, cooperation teaches children how to recognize and appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, which makes them a better, more harmonious and productive team. Competition can also be detrimental because it can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which causes stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when it doesn't work out. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic mindset, where they focus too much on their own success, which in turn causes them to become too anxious and depressed when they fail. Cooperation teaches children how to get along with each other, share ideas, and support each other, which makes them more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete has its advantages, I think that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.; According to the issue of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate, the parents and teachers have been discussing it for a long time. While some people argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I strongly disagree with this idea. Children who learn to cooperate can develop essential social skills such as communication, listening, empathy and problem-solving. This enables them to work effectively as a team, which is the most important skill needed in the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, when children cooperate, they can learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, so that they can work together to reach a common goal. Besides, children who are taught to compete can develop an unhealthy obsession with winning and competition. This can cause them to be disappointed and have low self-esteem. Cooperation is more conducive to a child's overall development, allowing them to become more mature, empathic and productive people. In conclusion, although competition has its own advantages, it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. I think the schools should use the methods of teaching children to cooperate, because they are able to develop into successful and productive people.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent."; Education is the foundation for future development of the individual, but the education of cooperation has its own importance. Teaching children to cooperate develops in them the skills of the future: communication, friendship, empathy, problem solving. Those who claim that children are taught to compete believe that they can only achieve success in life if they are taught to compete, while others insist that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in their adult lives. Cooperation also creates a feeling of solidarity and respect for each other, which is very useful for building strong and lasting relationships. Cooperation makes it easier for children to understand each other's abilities and help each other out of weakness. Cooperation is a natural and necessary condition for self-realization. Children taught to compete tend to become very individualistic and egoistic, and often when they do not achieve success, they become anxious and their self-esteem is reduced. The children who are taught to work together, exchange their ideas, help each other will develop into more rounded, empathetic and selfless people who are able to negotiate and work in a complex world. In conclusion, although competition is not without its benefits, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Those who know how to cooperate will become empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.; For some years now, teachers and parents have been arguing about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate. The former is a necessity for future success, while the latter is better for the development of the personality of the future. Children learn to cooperate in order to develop the necessary skills of communication, tolerance, empathy and the ability to solve problems. And this is a lesson they need for the future. When children work together, they understand the strengths and weaknesses of their peers, which makes them a harmonious and efficient team, which, in turn, prepares them for a team in the real world, where the importance of cooperation and teamwork is very high. Competition can be excessive, which is why it creates an unhealthy obsession with winning, stress, and low self-esteem in case of failure. On the other hand, the competition can lead to an unhealthy individualism in children, causing them to put their own interests before others, to get excited and disappointed in case of failure. Cooperation creates a well-balanced personality, where children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, and when they face the difficulties of the real world, they are better prepared to build relationships, work in harmony with each other and do their best. In conclusion, although competition is necessary for children to be successful, in the long run it is more beneficial to teach them to cooperate. Teaching children to cooperate is the only way to raise a generation of empathetic, cohesive and successful people.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.; This question has become a serious subject of debate among teachers and parents. Some believe that the teaching of competition is essential for the success of children, others believe that teaching cooperation is more beneficial for them. Cooperation develops children's social skills, such as communication, listening, empathy, and problem-solving. Cooperation also helps children to develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important for the formation of strong and lasting relationships. When children work together, they will appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which is very useful for the organization and production of the whole team. The environment is a little too tense, and children feel under great pressure to win, and the idea of fairness and the concept of sportsmanship are forgotten. On the contrary, when children are taught to compete, they will become too individualistic, and will have a strong desire to win, which will cause them to have a high level of self-esteem and reduce their anxiety when they encounter failures. Cooperation can help children to become more confident and more supportive of each other. In the future, they can solve problems together, and build and maintain a close relationship with others. In conclusion, although both cooperation and competition have their own benefits, I believe that children should be taught to work together in the long run. Cooperation is the only way to develop a successful, harmonious and cooperative society.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world."; When should children be taught to compete or to co-operate? This question has aroused deep interest among teachers and parents and has led to heated arguments. I would like to point out that although some people think that teaching children to compete is a must for their future success, I think that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial for their development into a useful adult. Co-operation fosters mutual respect, which is the basis for building strong and lasting relationships. In my opinion, when children work together, they learn to appreciate the benefits and limitations of their joint effort, thus preparing themselves for their future roles as members of the society where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. The overemphasis on competition in schools leads to unhealthy competition and unhealthy emphasis on winning, and in the end, unhealthy obsession with winning. This leads to stress, anxiety, and lower self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. So, by learning to work together, share ideas, and support each other, children develop into more rounded, more productive, more empathetic, and more productive adults. In my opinion, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, I believe that it is more beneficial to teach children to co-operate. Co-operation is a must for the development of a generation of empathetic, productive, and successful individuals.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.; Let's do it. Many educators and parents have argued that teaching children to compete with each other is a great advantage for their future success. I argue that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial for them as a person. Cooperation instills the idea of community and mutual respect that is necessary for building a strong relationship. Cooperation teaches children to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, which in turn enables them to form a more harmonious and productive team. Cooperation is also more likely to promote the concept of fairness and sportsmanship than competition. On the other hand, competition teaches children to be selfish and focus on their own success. When children meet failure, they will become anxious and their self-esteem will decline. Cooperation teaches children to share, care, and help each other, which makes them well-rounded, empathetic, and productive people in the future. In conclusion, although competition has some advantages, I think that teaching children to coexist will be more beneficial for them as a person in the long run. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative, and successful individuals.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners."; This topic has been a matter of great controversy between educators and parents for many years. While some claim that teaching children to compete is more important for their future success, I am of the view that teaching children to co-operate has more benefits in bringing up good adults. This is because co-operation makes it possible for children to work together to achieve common goals, and this helps them to appreciate the contribution each one makes to the whole, which teaches them to work well with others. It also gives them the opportunity to learn how to live in harmony with others. In the real world, co-operation is one of the most important things in a group, and is very helpful in building a cohesive, strong team. Further, competition can create an environment where the children feel compelled to achieve at all costs, and they are deprived of the opportunity to learn about fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can lead to an unhealthy focus on self-interest, which in turn leads to a lack of self-esteem and poor mental health. From working together and sharing, children learn to support and help one another, which helps them to build good relationships with others, which in turn helps them to live in harmony and give back to society. In my view, while competition has its own advantages, I think that teaching children to co-operate is a more important life skill. In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is an essential way to raise a compassionate, co-operative and successful generation.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page."; On the other hand, many people also believe that teaching children to compete is the best way to teach them to succeed in life, and that cooperation is the best way to develop essential social skills like communication, compromise, empathy and problem solving. Write your opinion about this issue. Cooperation is also important because it creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for a lasting relationship. The task of children to work together and achieve a common goal helps them learn to appreciate the abilities and limitations of their peers and is a valuable life lesson that will help them later in life. Competition also tends to create a cutthroat atmosphere where children feel they have to succeed at all costs, which can damage fair play and the concept of sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can lead children to believe that their own success is more important than the success of others. This can lead to unhealthy competition, which in turn leads to depression, stress and low self-esteem when children encounter failure. Cooperation also builds a foundation for children to form healthy, productive and balanced relationships as adults. Finally, I believe that although there are benefits to competition, it is ultimately more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of kind, cooperative and successful people.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.; . It has been argued that teaching children to compete with each other is necessary for their future development, while others believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial to the formation of their future adulthood. Cooperation teaches children to respect each other and to cooperate in their endeavors, which in turn prepares them for the working world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. For example, a focus on competition can foster a cutthroat mentality among children, in which they feel pressured to succeed at any cost, which undermines the value of fairness and good sportsmanship. In contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success and a poor self-esteem when faced with failure. Children who are taught to work together are more likely to become well-rounded adults who can build positive relationships and contribute to society. In conclusion, I believe that, although competition has its benefits, it is more beneficial to teach children to work together. Cooperation is the key to raising a compassionate, successful and productive generation.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.; Students in secondary school and higher school are taught many different subjects: biology, physics, chemistry, history, literature, math, and foreign languages. However, a debate has been ongoing for decades about whether children should be taught to compete or work together. I personally believe that teaching children to work together will help them to be better citizens in the future, because it develops their communication, empathy, problem solving, and other important social skills. Also, a sense of community and mutual respect is an important ingredient for building strong and lasting relationships. When children are working together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and this makes them a better team. This also prepares them for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Besides, if competition is emphasized too much, children may feel excessive pressure to win at all costs, which can be detrimental to their self-esteem. Teaching children to compete instead may lead to unhealthy and unhealthy competition, and a sense of entitlement and unhappiness. By working together, children learn to share their ideas and support each other, which develops their maturity and empathy. In the end, although competition has its benefits, I believe that children should be taught to work together more. In order to foster a generation of successful, well-adjusted, and compassionate individuals, children should be taught to work together.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.; This topic has been a hotly debated issue among educators and parents for years. Although some believe that teaching children to compete with each other is necessary for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future usefulness. Co-operation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is the foundation of a strong and lasting relationship. In the real world, the most important thing is to learn to work with others and share ideas and achievements, so teaching children to work together is an important preparation for the future. If you make too much emphasis on competition, the children may be under pressure to succeed at any cost, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning and a lack of self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. On the other hand, when you teach children to compete with each other, they become too individualistic and focus on their own success. If they have problems, they feel too anxious and have too little self-confidence. When you teach children to work together, share ideas, and help each other, they become more social, empathetic, and successful adults. When they enter the complex world, they will be able to work more efficiently as a team, and they will be able to establish stronger relationships with other people. In conclusion, although competition has some advantages, I believe that teaching children to work together is more useful in the long run. Educating children to work together is essential for a society that must work as a team.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.; Disagree with this. Instead, teaching children to work together is a much more beneficial way to help them become useful adults. Cooperation helps to build a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for building a strong and lasting relationship. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to recognize and appreciate each other's skills and weaknesses, and thereby form a productive and harmonious team. If children are overly focused on competition, they will put winning first, regardless of the cost, and the values of fairness and equality will be lost. On the other hand, teaching children to compete will make them overly individualistic, obsessed with winning, and anxious when they encounter obstacles. Children who are taught to work together, share ideas, and support each other will be more able to deal with the complexity of life and learn to form close and lasting relationships, to work together, and to contribute to society. In short, while teaching children to compete can have its advantages, I believe that teaching children to work together will have a much longer-term effect on them. Cooperation is the key to the creation of a generation of people who are good at working together and are successful in life.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.; Whereas some claim that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I believe that it is teaching them to work together that will be the more useful thing for their later life. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together has been an ongoing discussion for a long time among parents and educators. However, I think that children should be taught to work together. Working together enables children to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, which creates a more cohesive and efficient team and also prepares them for a future in which cooperation and teamwork are more highly valued. In addition, the excessive emphasis on competition can create a fierce and cutthroat environment in which children feel the need to win at all costs, which can reduce the importance of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to an overly individualistic approach in which children learn to put their own success above the success of others, which can lead to increased stress, anxiety and self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. As children learn to work together, share ideas and help each other, they become more empathetic, empathetic and productive adults who can easily navigate through the complex world and create strong relationships, work together and contribute positively to their community. In short, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I think that teaching them to work together is more useful for their future. I therefore believe that teaching children to work together is the best way to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence."; Learning to cooperate, rather than compete, is the best way to teach children to be useful, successful, and well-rounded adults. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has sparked heated discussions among parents and educators. Cooperation teaches respect for others, which is essential to forming strong, lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to respect each other’s differences, which enables them to work together harmoniously and effectively. This helps them to prepare for the real world, where the ability to work in a team is highly valued. Cooperation also fosters fairness and the spirit of good sportsmanship. Teaching children to compete can foster an unhealthy inclination towards individualism and success, which leads to a stressful, defeatist attitude and the development of low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation teaches children to share, listen, and support each other. This enables them to become more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who can successfully negotiate the complexities of the real world and work effectively with others. In conclusion, while there are advantages to both competition and cooperation, I believe that it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Children should be taught to work together rather than compete, so that they can grow up to be well-adjusted, empathetic, and successful adults.
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.; Whether it is better to teach children to compete or to co-operate has long been the subject of debate between teachers and parents. Whereas some believe that competition is the best way to develop in children, I strongly disagree and believe that teaching them to co-operate is more beneficial in developing into good citizens. Cooperation is also the basis of building strong, long-lasting friendships. Secondly, co-operation enables children to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which makes for a better and more efficient team, and this prepares them for the real world, where teamwork is paramount. Competition on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to depression and lowered self-esteem when they do not achieve their goals. Competition also instills in children an unhealthy obsession with winning, which in turn can lead to stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem. This can be devastating for children when they enter the real world, where they need to be well prepared to work in a team, with strong, supportive relationships with other people. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, teaching children to co-operate will help them to be better citizens. Co-operation is the basis of compassionate, well-adjusted and successful adults.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.; In recent years, educators and parents have been very interested in the debate between children learning to compete or cooperate. Some people think that children should learn to compete because it is useful for them in the future, but I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their development into useful adults. Co-operation is a sign of trust, which is an important part of human life. Cooperation enables children to be close to each other and form a harmonious group, which is an important lesson for the real world. Cooperation also creates a more friendly relationship with the world. Children who learn to compete can easily become egotistical and selfish, reducing their self-esteem and confidence to the lowest level when they fail. Cooperation enables children to form strong ties, share ideas, and make each other stronger, and will become more mature and capable of forming long-term relationships and building strong teams. In my opinion, although competition has its advantages, it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Children who learn to cooperate can become successful people in the future, with compassion, trust and ability.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution."; It is also argued that children should be taught to compete, rather than to work together, for their future success. In my opinion, the opposite is true, as teaching children to work together helps them to develop important social skills, such as co-operation, understanding and the ability to deal with adversity. Furthermore, working together helps them to establish a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for the development of a strong social network. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their team members, and become a more cohesive and productive group. Also, an emphasis on competition leads to an unhealthy obsession with winning, and a lack of respect for the rules of the game, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to an excessively individualistic outlook, where the emphasis is on individual success, and they suffer a loss of self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. By contrast, children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, develop into more well-rounded, compassionate and productive adults, who are better able to cope with the complexities of the adult world, and build strong relationships, and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, while there are advantages to being taught to compete, I believe that in the long run it is more beneficial to teach children to work together. To this end, the most effective way to bring up children is to teach them to work together, which leads to the development of a generation of compassionate, productive and successful adults.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.; In recent years, the debate over whether to teach children to compete or to coexist has sparked much debate among parents and educators. Although some claim that the development of competition is essential for the future success of the child, I firmly believe that the development of coexistence is more beneficial for the children in the long run. Coexistence not only develops a sense of community and mutual respect, but also prepares children for the world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Also, the excessive emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat atmosphere in which children feel a lot of pressure to succeed at all costs, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing frustration, anxiety and low self-esteem in the face of failure. In the end, by learning to work together, share ideas, and support one another, children will become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who can better handle the complexities of the real world, develop strong relationships, work in a team and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, although competition has its own benefits, I think that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. Coexistence is essential to raise a generation of compassionate, supportive and successful individuals.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.; (250 words) The question of whether children should be taught to compete or coexist is a controversial issue for teachers and parents. Although some argue that children who are taught to compete are more successful in life, I firmly believe that children who are taught to coexist are more useful as adults. They are also more important in building long-term relationships. When children are taught to work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their partners, which will later help them to work together more effectively in the future. And there is the danger of competition. The emphasis on competition can lead to a tendency for the children to achieve success at any cost, which can be detrimental to the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete, they are more likely to become too individualistic and have an unhealthy obsession with their own success, which will cause them to suffer and lose their self-esteem when they are exposed to failure. By learning to coexist, children can become more flexible, more empathetic, and more useful as adults. It can also help them in a difficult and complicated world to build strong relationships and work together effectively. In conclusion, although competition is also a positive thing, I believe that teaching children to coexist will benefit them more in the long run. The teaching of coexistence is the basis for raising a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.; I think children should be taught to cooperate instead of compete. The question has been debated among educators and parents for decades. The case for teaching children to compete is that it is essential for future success. I believe that teaching children to cooperate will help them grow into useful adults. Cooperation also promotes a sense of community and respect for others, which are essential to establishing a strong and lasting relationship. Besides, when children work together, they appreciate each other's abilities and thus learn to work together more effectively, which also prepares them for the work environment where collaboration is important. Cooperation can also lead to the realization that, by pushing children to compete too much, we are making them too individualistic, which will lead to stress and anxiety when they fail. Besides, teaching children to compete creates a cutthroat mentality where children are under tremendous pressure to succeed and often lose sight of fairness and sportsmanship. Cooperation can build a stronger sense of community among the children, which will help them as they grow into productive adults. In short, though there are advantages to teaching children to compete, in the long run, I think that teaching them to cooperate will be more beneficial. To sum up, teaching children to cooperate will help them grow into caring, cooperative, and successful adults.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.; Either competition or co-operation is the best way to teach children how to behave in society. This has caused debate among parents and educators. Some people argue that competition is essential to the success of the children in later life, but I think it is more useful to teach them to work together. Moreover, co-operation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary to build lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they can appreciate the differences in their skills and abilities and thus form a more harmonious and productive team, which is a good lesson for their future lives, where work in teams is highly valued. Also, the excessive emphasis on competition can lead to unhealthy competition, causing them to compete at all costs and compromising fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, the emphasis on competition may lead children to be more selfish and compete with each other for personal success, which can lead to depression and low self-esteem if they lose. When children learn to work together and help each other, they develop into more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. In the complex world of adulthood, they are more capable of building relationships, working together and making a contribution to their community. In conclusion, although competition is useful in many ways, it is more useful to teach children to work together. Co-operation is essential to a harmonious and successful society.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;" For example, if you had a college class on ""Managing Your Money"", you would probably write that I should choose the latter topic. The argument of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has aroused a great deal of debate among educators and parents. Cooperation has many benefits, the most important of which is the formation of a strong sense of community and mutual respect, which are critical to the formation of strong and lasting relationships. Children, working together towards a common goal, learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, which, in turn, prepares them for the real world where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. In addition, a spirit of competition can lead to a cut-throat environment in which children feel they have to achieve success at any cost, resulting in a loss of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, children taught to compete can develop a highly individualistic and unhealthy obsession with winning at all costs, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem if they lose. Cooperation, on the other hand, fosters a sense of belonging, allowing children to learn to trust, share, and support each other, developing more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who are better able to cope with the complexities of the real world and to positively contribute to society. In conclusion, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that a greater benefit can be achieved by teaching them to cooperate. Children who are taught to cooperate are better able to relate to and empathize with others, and are thus better able to successfully cope with the world as adults."
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.; This is an intensely debated issue. Some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success. Others believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future development. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical to building strong, lasting relationships. Moreover, cooperation prepares children for a society where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. An over-emphasis on competition can lead to a cutthroat atmosphere where children are encouraged to win at all costs, undermining the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a highly individualistic mentality in which success is equated with personal gain. When faced with setbacks, children may suffer from depression and a loss of self-esteem. Cooperation develops children’s abilities to share ideas, help each other and support one another. Cooperation is what makes children empathetic and productive members of society. To sum up, although competition has its benefits, I believe that in the long run it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Teaching children to cooperate is the key to raising a generation of empathetic, compassionate, and successful adults.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.; The second question is: should children be taught to compete or to co-operate? This question has provoked debate among parents and teachers. Some people think that a child who learns to compete will have a better future. Others think that children who learn to co-operate will have a better future. The school situation is the same as the outside world, and children need to learn to cooperate with others to do their best. In addition, competition can make the children obsessed with competition, and the education of co-operation is in danger. But if children are taught to compete, they will have a selfish idea, which will lead to a strong sense of personal achievement, and then they will be distressed and anxious, and will lose their self-esteem. A lot of this can be avoided if they learn to cooperate. When they are taught to work together, share ideas, and encourage each other, children will become more mature and empathetic people, able to make a good contribution to society, and can better adapt to the complex situation in the world. To sum up, teaching children to co-operate is the only way to educate people who can care for others and be successful.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.; Disagree: Teaching children to compete rather than cooperate has caused intense debate among educators and parents. It has been argued that teaching children to compete is more advantageous to their future success, but I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to their growth as human beings. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important in establishing long-lasting relationships. Also, when children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which leads to more productive and harmonious work, which will prepare them for the world of work where teamwork and cooperation are highly valued. Cooperation also teaches children to compromise, which can be very beneficial to them as they grow up. On the other hand, competition can lead to an unhealthy emphasis on individual success and competition, which can lead to stress and anxiety and a loss of self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. By learning to work together, share ideas, and support each other, children can become well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. As they enter the adult world, they will be more able to build strong relationships, work more effectively in teams, and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is essential for raising a generation of people who are empathetic, supportive, and successful.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.; Teaching children to compete with each other or to co-operate has always been an important issue of debate between parents and educators. It is true that competition can teach children how to be more independent, but I believe that learning to co-operate with others can be more useful in developing good people. Cooperation between children can help them appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which in turn can help them build better relationships with their peers, which in turn is useful for them in the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, competition can create a cut-throat environment where children are under tremendous pressure to succeed at all costs, thus destroying the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they will be too self-centred and may end up in a vicious circle of stress, anxiety and poor self-esteem when they fail to achieve their own goals. Children who learn to co-operate with each other are more likely to grow into well-rounded individuals, able to build strong relationships and work together as a team, and able to give back to society. To sum up, I believe that while competition has its merits, it is more beneficial in the long run to teach children to co-operate. Co-operation is the best way to help children develop into good, strong, compassionate, and successful adults.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.; If children are taught to compete, some argue that they will succeed in the future, but others think that children should be taught to coexist, which will help them learn important social skills, such as communication, understanding, empathy and problem solving. In this essay, I want to argue that children should be taught to work together. Work together teaches children the respect and mutual understanding they need to build strong and long-lasting relationships. It also prepares them for the world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, an excessive emphasis on competition creates an environment where children are under pressure to succeed at any cost, and this destroys the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they will have a very selfish mindset, they will focus on their own success, they will have the desire to win, which will cause anxiety, anxiety and self-esteem if they fail. If children are taught to work together, they will be able to share ideas, help each other and become more cooperative and well-rounded adults, able to build strong relationships, work together effectively and positively contribute to their community. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to work together will bring more benefits in the long run. The goal of teaching children to work together is to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.; The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has led to a lot of discussion among teachers and parents. Many argue that competition is more beneficial in the long run. In my opinion, however, it is cooperation that helps children to develop social skills, and they are able to solve problems and communicate with each other. Cooperation also promotes mutual respect and good relationships. When children are given tasks that involve working together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses and become a more effective team. This is good preparation for working life where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also fosters fairness and mutual support. In my view, too much emphasis on competition may foster a cut-throat mentality, which can make children obsessed with winning, causing stress and a lack of self-confidence if they are unsuccessful. Cooperation can also develop a sense of sharing and of community, so that when children become adults they are better able to work in teams and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, while there are advantages to both cooperation and competition, in my view, it is more beneficial for children to be taught to cooperate. In my opinion, cooperation is a more effective way of preparing children for the future.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.; Among educators and parents there has been a lot of discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. Some people argue that competition is essential for future success, but I disagree. I think it is better to teach children to work together than to compete. Co-operation builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which are important in building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, which leads to a more harmonious and productive team. In the real world, it is necessary to value teamwork and to work together in order to succeed. Competition on the other hand, can make children too individualistic. They will be more obsessed with their own success than with that of others, and when they are unsuccessful, they will feel frustrated and lose self-confidence. Children who learn to work together and help each other develop into empathetic and productive adults, who can deal with the complexities of the world around them and succeed. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. It is the only way to raise a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.; The debate on whether or not children should be taught to compete or cooperate has caused intense debate among educators and parents. Some believe that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success. I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful to them as adults. Cooperation is the foundation for the formation of communities and a foundation for mutual respect, which is essential to the formation of a close and lasting relationship. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and the value of working as a team becomes clear. In addition, too much emphasis on competition may lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, resulting in stress and a lack of self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy focus on individual success, resulting in the possibility of over-achieving and stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem when the child is unsuccessful. Cooperation is the foundation for the formation of a solid relationship and the development of the full potential of a person. In conclusion, while competition is a useful tool for the development of a child, I believe that teaching a child to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Children must be taught to cooperate if we are to raise a generation of kind, caring, and successful adults.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives."; Why? The education of children should emphasize the ability to co-operate rather than compete. A great debate has been going on for a long time between educators and parents: Should children be taught to compete or to co-operate? The schooling of children should be aimed at encouraging co-operation rather than competition. The benefits of co-operation are well known: children learn to work together and to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which prepares them for the later life when collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, when competition is excessively emphasized, children often experience the feeling of guilt for failing, which in turn can make them anxious and lose their self-esteem. On the other hand, the ability to compete often leads to an unhealthy emphasis on individual success, which in turn can lead to anxiety and lack of self-esteem when they experience failure. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, grow into well-balanced, empathetic and successful people. As they go through life and deal with the difficulties of the real world, they will be better prepared to build strong relationships, work effectively in groups and contribute positively to society. To sum up, although there are certain advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. To me, the education of children is to teach them to co-operate. This will help them to grow up into kind, friendly and successful people.
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.; The task of preparing children for cooperation or competition has caused a great debate among educators and parents. Although some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important to prepare them for adult life. Cooperation is also a sense of community and mutual respect that can be built with other children. Competition is a tendency to want to win at any cost. Moreover, it is an unfair environment that puts children under pressure to succeed at all costs, undermining the spirit of fair play and good manners. Cooperation teaches children to share ideas, respect others, and help each other, and when they grow up, they will be able to understand each other's feelings and will be able to build strong relationships and work together. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation will be more beneficial for children in the long run. Cooperation is the way to bring up a generation of individuals who are compassionate, cooperative, and successful.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.; Teaching children to cooperate has been the subject of discussion between parents and teachers. Some argue that teaching children to compete is the best way to teach them to achieve future success. I firmly believe that teaching children to work together is a better way to teach them to be useful people. Co-operation develops mutual trust and respect, which is an important foundation for establishing and maintaining relationships. Children can learn to work together to achieve common goals. This helps children work together harmoniously, which is useful in future work. In addition, competition can create a cutthroat environment where children are forced to win at all costs. This will reduce the spirit of fair competition and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a sense of individualism and self-interest, which can lead to stress and anxiety, and even low self-esteem, when they fail. I therefore believe that by teaching children to work together, share ideas, and help each other, they can become well-rounded, empathetic, and fruitful adults, and when they grow up, they can build good relationships, work well in groups, and benefit their communities. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I still think teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial. Teaching children to cooperate is a major contribution to cultivating empathetic, harmonious, and successful individuals.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school."; If you can’t decide, write about both choices. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has been a topic of much discussion among educators and parents. The debate has largely centered on whether teaching children to compete is better for their future success. Cooperation, however, teaches children a sense of community and mutual respect that are important to building long-lasting relationships. When children cooperate, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which is an important lesson for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. And finally, too much emphasis on competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can result in stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem when they experience failure. Cooperation develops well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who are better prepared to deal with the complexities of the real world. In conclusion, while there are certainly some advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate has more long-term benefits. Cooperation is essential for raising compassionate, hard-working and successful adults.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.; If we teach children to compete instead of to cooperate, there will be a lot of debate among teachers and parents. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is much more useful for their future. Cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect that is the basis for long-term relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they can better understand each other's abilities and qualities, and then their group can work together more efficiently. And in the future, they will be able to work together in a much more productive and harmonious way in the real world, where teamwork is a necessity. Cooperation also eliminates the feeling of unfair competition and betrayal that children sometimes feel, making them feel anxious and anxious. If they don't win, they will feel extremely anxious and depressed. Cooperation can only help children become more empathetic, more tolerant and more active. As they grow up, they will be able to build stronger relationships with others, be more effective in their teams, and make a better contribution to their communities. In short, although competition has its advantages, I think that teaching children to cooperate is much more beneficial in the long run. Is the way to cultivate the next generation of people who can cooperate and win?
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress."; The debate on whether it is better to teach children to compete or to cooperate has led to many arguments among educators and parents. Some argue that children should be taught to compete in order to be successful later in life, while others argue that it is more important to teach children to cooperate in order to become useful people later. I think that teaching children to cooperate is more useful to their future lives and teaches them important social skills such as communication, understanding, and problem-solving. Cooperation also develops a feeling of community and mutual respect that is very important to building strong relationships. Children, while working together towards a common goal, can learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which can result in a much more harmonious and productive group. Also, this can better prepare children for later life, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. It can also lead to a lifelong obsession with success, which can result in lower self-esteem and stress when they encounter setbacks. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy sense of self-interest and lead to a deep desire for success, which can result in anxiety, stress, and a lack of self-confidence when faced with failure. In addition, when children learn to share ideas and help each other, they become more mature, better able to deal with the complexities of real life and are better able to build strong relationships, work in teams, and contribute to society. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, it is more beneficial to teach them to cooperate in the long run. It is this which will allow children to grow up into helpful, successful, and well-adjusted adults.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds."; It is a hotly debated topic among parents and educators, and some argue that competition is essential for children's future success, while others argue that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in making them useful adults. I personally believe that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete, because children can develop more important social skills. Co-operation can create a feeling of community and mutual respect, and this will help them develop a sense of trust and mutual benefit, which will be beneficial to their future careers and lives. Competition can also lead to unhealthy self-centredness, causing unhealthy obsession with success and causing stress and self-esteem problems when they fail. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may develop a very individualistic attitude and put their own interests first, which can lead to their own success and other people's failures. Cooperation makes children mature, more well-rounded, empathetic and active adults, and as they learn to cooperate, they will be able to work more efficiently as a team and be more useful in their community. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in the long run. In fact, the education of co-operation is the most important way to make children more empathetic, helpful and successful people.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.; It has been argued that children should be taught to compete in order to make them successful in life, while others say that they should be taught to cooperate. I think that teaching children to cooperate is more important than teaching them to compete, because children who are taught to cooperate develop a wide range of social skills such as communication, cooperation, empathy and problem-solving. As a result, they are better prepared for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses when they work together towards a common goal. In addition, children who are taught to compete are under enormous pressure to succeed, which makes them unable to tolerate failure, leading to stress and anxiety. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy focus on self-sufficiency, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem when they encounter failure. Children who are taught to work together, share ideas and help each other are better able to cope with the complexities of the real world and are better equipped to build strong relationships and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Teaching children to cooperate is vital for raising a generation of compassionate, cooperative, and successful adults.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government."; Teaching children to compete instead of co-operate has been a source of long-standing controversy among educators and parents. vhile some beleive that competition is the key to success in later life, I firmly beleive that children should be taught to co-operate in order to become good adults. In my opinion, co-operation teaches children to respect each other and to live together in harmony. Also, co-operation enables children to understand the importance of sharing, which helps them to appreciate the value of the world of adults where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, creates a cutthroat atmosphere in which children feel they have to win at all costs, and this can lead to a lack of sportsmanship and fairness. On the other hand, competition can lead to a selfish, self-centred attitude in which the children are too preoccupied with their own success. This can lead to a tendency to become tense and anxious, and this can be detrimental to their self-esteem. In my view, co-operation enables children to learn how to work together, share ideas and help each other, which develops them into good, co-operative adults who are capable of dealing with the complexities of real life. In conclusion, while competition can also be beneficial, I think that teaching children to co-operate is more advantageous in the long run. vhile co-operation teaches children to share and work together, competition teaches children to compete, which is counterproductive. vhen children learn to co-operate, they become good, successful people.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television."; If you are in the third grade, you have completed tasks one, two, three, four, five and six. In the past decade, there has been a debate in schools and among parents about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. Although some educators and parents believe that competition is the best preparation for success in adult life, I firmly believe that if children learn to work together, they will become useful and responsible adults. Co-operation builds community, which is necessary for strong and lasting relationships. Children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which will make the group more productive. Besides, competition can be cutthroat, where children are expected to achieve success at all costs, without regard for fairness or sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can lead to unhealthy individualism, the need to win at all costs, which can lead to anxiety, stress and lower self-esteem when failure occurs. As children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, they become better balanced, empathetic and more productive people, who will be able to live and work more successfully with others. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that the most beneficial thing is for children to work together. For, in the long run, this will make them more compassionate, co-operative and successful adults.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life."; If you are a mother or a father, you must already have heard the debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. The opinion of teachers and parents is divided on this issue, but I firmly believe that children should learn to work together, because if they can learn to work together, they will be able to develop important social skills such as communication, understanding and problem-solving. And also, by working together, they can get along with each other and respect each other, and it is a good habit for them to learn, because in the real world it is the highest appreciation and the most important cooperation. And if competition is taught to children too much, it will become a vicious environment, and children will feel that they must win at all costs, so they will lose the concept of fairness and sportsmanship. It is also possible that the child is too selfish, puts himself above others, and if he encounters failure, he will feel distressed and unworthy. The result is that the children are not able to develop their skills well, but they become less empathetic and less able to deal with problems. By learning to work together, share ideas, and help each other, children can become more well-rounded, more empathetic, and more able to solve the problems in the real world, so they can work together in the community. In conclusion, although there is also a lot of benefits in teaching children to compete, in my opinion, it is more beneficial to teach them to work together. Because teaching children to work together is the key to raising a generation of empathetic, cooperative, and successful people.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon."; There is an endless discussion among teachers and parents on whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate. Cooperation and competition have become a favorite subject for study, and I strongly disagree with the idea that children must compete. Cooperation is a vital part of education because children learn respect for others and a sense of community that makes it easier to build strong relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, which in turn helps them appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of cooperation. In the future, cooperation is needed to survive in the world where collaboration and cooperation are the most important. Cooperation can also help children build self-esteem and increase their awareness of their own strengths and weaknesses. In contrast, teaching children to compete creates an egocentric attitude that emphasizes the importance of success and the possibility of losing when they encounter obstacles. Cooperation teaches children to share ideas, support each other, and create a better future for themselves and others. Cooperation is not a bad thing, but I believe that teaching children to cooperate will be better for them in the long run. Children must be taught to cooperate in order to raise a generation of children who are compassionate, cooperative, and successful.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.; If we teach children to compete or co-operate, we raise them in a way that makes them useful adults in the future. Some people think teaching children to compete is better for their future success, but I firmly believe that teaching children to co-operate is the best way to teach them to become useful adults. Co-operation instils in children a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary to build strong and long-lasting relationships. It is also good preparation for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success and failure, which could cause children to become anxious and unable to cope with life when they experience failure. Moreover, children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other will grow into more mature, empathetic and useful adults. Teaching children to compete is not inherently bad, but I believe that in the long run, teaching children to co-operate will have a greater impact on their lives. Children who learn to co-operate will grow into more mature, empathetic, successful and happy adults.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.; You may begin by saying that teaching a child to compete is a more useful way to prepare him for future success, and that learning a child to co-operate develops in him the necessary social skills, like communication, listening, understanding and problem-solving. I think that teaching a child to cooperate is more useful to prepare him for adulthood, and that he should not be taught to compete. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for the establishment of a strong relationship. Cooperation prepares children for future life, where the development of individual and collective abilities is very important. On the other hand, competition develops a more individualistic attitude in children, a selfish desire for success, and an unhealthy obsession with the outcome of the situation. Competition also causes stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem when children have to deal with failure. In addition, if children learn to work together, share their ideas, support and encourage each other, they will be better prepared to enter the real world, where they will be better able to build relationships, work in teams and contribute positively to the community. In conclusion, while learning to compete has its benefits, learning to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Children who learn to co-operate become better people and adults who are able to work together and communicate with each other, a society of successful and responsible people.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules."; While many people argue that teaching children to compete is the best preparation for their future success, I strongly believe that teaching children to cooperate is the best way to prepare them to be useful members of society. I also believe that children learn the importance of teamwork and how to work together to solve problems. It is this same skill that is useful in the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are valued. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a more harmonious and productive team. Competition can be a source of conflict when children feel they must succeed at all costs, which can make children lose respect for the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic approach to life, where children place their success above the success of others. When a child encounters a failure, he or she may feel anxious and depressed. Cooperation allows children to develop into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. When they have to cope with the complexities of the real world, they will be able to build strong relationships, work together effectively, and serve their communities. In short, while competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate has a greater impact on their long-term success. Cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of empathetic, collaborating, and successful people.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.; Let me start by saying that it has become a topic of great controversy whether to teach children to compete or cooperate. Many people argue that a competition is a necessary requirement for future success. I am convinced that teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial to their later development as useful and responsible citizens. Cooperation also fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate the abilities and skills of their classmates, which inevitably leads to a more efficient and effective team. Cooperation also promotes fair play and the concept of sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish mentality where they set their own success as the most important. It also can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which will lead to a feeling of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when faced with failure. When children learn to work together, share ideas, and support each other, they become more caring, compassionate, and productive adults. As they face the many challenges of life, they are better equipped to build strong relationships, work effectively in teams, and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, while I am sure that there are many benefits to teaching children to compete, I am sure that the benefits of teaching them to cooperate outweigh the benefits of teaching them to compete. Teaching children to cooperate is the best way to raise a generation of caring, compassionate, and successful individuals.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.; I do not agree that children should be taught to compete rather than cooperate. Cooperation develops important social skills such as communication, understanding, and problem-solving. Cooperation also creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important for building a strong relationship with other people. In addition, when children work together to achieve a common goal, they can understand each other's weaknesses and strengths, and become more cohesive. This will be useful to them in the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition can be very selfish and unhealthy, as children are obsessed with winning at all costs, which will reduce their self-esteem when they encounter failures. On the contrary, competition will make children too individualistic and focus on individual achievement, which can lead to self-esteem and the stress of being overly focused on one's own problems. By working together, sharing ideas and supporting each other, children will become well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults. . In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation will produce a generation of successful, compassionate and cohesive people.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.; The issue of whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has led to intense debate among teachers and parents. While some educators and parents argue that teaching children to compete is important for their future success, I argue that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial for their development as responsible adults. Co-operation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical for the development of strong and lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they come to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and become a more productive team. This prepares them for the real world, where co-operation and teamwork are highly valued. There is also a risk that too much emphasis on competition could lead to a cut-throat attitude among children, where they feel obliged to win at all costs, and this can undermine the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, a strong emphasis on competition can foster an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and poor self-esteem, if children fail. In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate will give them the confidence to enter the complex world and work as a team. In the end, I believe that although competition can teach children important skills, it is better for them to be taught to work as a team. Co-operation is the key to raising a generation of responsible and successful adults.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.; The debate between educators and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together has sparked a great deal of debate. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial to their future success as adults. In the process, they develop a sense of community and mutual respect that is essential to establishing strong, lasting relationships. Working together, they also learn to recognize the different strengths and weaknesses of their peers, which allows them to become better, more productive members of a team. Moreover, a competitive environment can create unhealthy pressure to succeed at all costs, which can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning and, consequently, lower self-esteem and poor health when they fail. In contrast, children who learn to work together, share ideas, and support one another grow into more empathetic, productive adults who are better able to navigate the complexities of the real world and make meaningful contributions to their communities. In short, while both methods have their advantages, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. It enables them to grow into successful, productive members of society.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.; This question has been a source of discussion for many years among parents and educators. The argument between teaching children to compete and teaching them to co-operate has been a source of much debate. Co-operation teaches respect for one another and helps build relationships. Co-operation also teaches children to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which is helpful in building a cohesive and effective group. It can also lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which causes stress, anxiety, and lowered self-esteem when they fail. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to a more individualistic way of thinking. Children are taught to value their own success more than the success of others. As a result, they are more selfish and less empathetic. Co-operation, on the other hand, teaches children to share, support each other, and work together. In the long run, it is more beneficial to teach children to co-operate. Teaching children to co-operate is the best way to raise a compassionate, team-oriented, and successful generation.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.; Or for this task: In the debate on whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate, teachers and parents argue that the former is more beneficial to future success and others that the latter is better for the children themselves. Teaching children to cooperate develops their communication, sharing, empathy and solving problems skills. Moreover, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical to establishing strong, lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which creates a more harmonious and productive team. Cooperation, however, also brings certain disadvantages. Firstly, there is a possibility of over-cooperation, which in turn may cause children to lose the habit of fairness and fairness in their relations. Secondly, the emphasis on competition can create an unhealthy obsession with winning and the loss of self-esteem when it is not achieved. Finally, it is important to note that in teaching children to compete, adults and schools may become indifferent to their development and may become over-concerned with the achievement of grades. In my opinion, however, the teaching of children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. It will help them to become successful and successful people.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.; In recent years, the question of whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has arouse the attention of educators and parents. Although some people claim that competition is the basis of success in the future, I believe that teaching children to work together is more useful for their future. Cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect that will be beneficial to children's future relationships. In the future, we will have to learn to work together to achieve common goals. A strong emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment that tries to win at all costs, and it also decreases the fairness and sportsmanship of children. Moreover, the children who compete with each other may have a tendency to be spoiled by their own successes, and they may have a tendency to be anxious, have a bad mood, and feel bad when they are rejected. Cooperation brings out the best in children, and the children who know how to work together, share ideas, and support each other will grow into adults who are sympathetic, hardworking, and can do things in a good way. In short, although competition has its benefits, I think that teaching children to work together is better for the future. Ultimately, teaching children to work together is the best way to produce sympathetic, cooperative, and successful people.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.; What if you tell a child to learn to cooperate with others instead of compete with others? This is an important question for parents and teachers to discuss. Some people argue that competition is the most important thing for children, that they will achieve more in life if they compete with others, while others argue that co-operation is more important for children to become useful adults. Co-operation creates a feeling of friendship and respect for others and that will be an advantage for them in the future. Also, working together with others makes children appreciate their strengths and weaknesses, which will help them in the future in their daily work. Co-operation is a life skill. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety, stress and low self-esteem when a child does not succeed. From a joint work, children learn to get along together, help each other and support each other. This creates well-developed, well-mannered, empathetic and useful adults, who can build good relationships, work together in teams and contribute to the community. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that children learn more useful things by working together. Learning to work together is essential for the development of successful, compassionate and well-educated people.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.; In addition, a discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has sparked a lively debate between parents and educators. While some argue that teaching children to compete is important for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate will help them grow up as useful people. Co-operation also helps children to develop a sense of solidarity and mutual respect, which are the foundations for building a lasting and strong relationship with others. As they work together, they can learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, and they can also work together in harmony and productivity. Moreover, when children are overly focused on competition, they will lose sight of fairness and honesty and, when they meet failures, they will suffer from their own self-esteem. On the contrary, if children are taught to compete, they will be obsessed with their own success and become obsessed with it, which can result in poor self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. When children learn to cooperate, share and support each other, they can grow up to be useful, kind-hearted and sympathetic adults, and as they grow up, they can form strong relationships with others, work effectively in groups and contribute to the development of society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I still believe that children should be taught to cooperate. It is the most effective way to raise a generation of successful, compassionate and cooperative people.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.; I think the government should spend more money on public transportation, because public transportation is the most appropriate way to move people. Cooperation and Competition, Cooperation and Competition The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has long been the topic of controversy among educators and parents. Some argue that competition is the key to children's future success, while others argue that children should be taught to cooperate so that they can develop the important skills of communication, participation, understanding, and problem-solving. Cooperation builds the trust and respect of a community and enables children to build strong, lasting relationships. Cooperation also teaches children to recognize their own weaknesses and strengths, which can be applied to the future workplace where collaboration and teamwork are rewarded. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an egocentric worldview that emphasizes the success of each individual at the expense of others. This egocentric mindset can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, which in turn can lead to anxiety, depression, and self-esteem. In conclusion, while competition can have its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is the best long-term option. This will enable them to develop a more complete worldview and to become more successful, empathetic, and successful adults in the future, who can build strong relationships, work effectively in a team, and ultimately give back to their communities. In the end, teaching children to cooperate is the best way to develop a generation of successful, empathetic, and successful people.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.; If you are a child, I would prefer to work with a group of children rather than alone. As we know, there has been a lot of discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or work together. But I believe that children should be taught to work together. If we teach children to work together, they will develop social skills, such as communication, sharing, empathy and problem solving. It is a better way to prepare children for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are very important. In addition, cooperation helps children to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes the team more harmonious and more productive. Also, when children are taught to compete too much, they are under pressure to win at any cost, and this may make children lose their self-confidence and lower their self-esteem. In contrast, children who are taught to compete tend to be more individualistic and only care about their own success. If they fail, they are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety. The ability to work together, share ideas, and support each other will help children grow into well-rounded, productive, and empathic adults who can successfully build relationships, work in a team, and make a contribution to society. In conclusion, although competition is a good thing, I still think that children should be taught to work together. This will ultimately help children to become more empathetic, more successful, and more productive members of society.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives."; The debate on whether or not children should be taught to compete or to work together has caused many discussions among teachers and parents. While many people are of the opinion that teaching children to compete is more useful for their future success, I disagree with them. Cooperative activities can help children to learn to work together, and they can also help them to learn mutual respect, which is important for them to establish long-lasting relationships. In the end, children who learn to work together can form a strong team that will benefit everyone. In addition, when children are put under too much pressure to compete with each other, they will become obsessed with winning at any cost, and they will lose the sense of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete, they are prone to be too selfish and they may lose their self-confidence and self-esteem, and they may become overly anxious and feel anxious if they do not win. When children are taught to cooperate, they will learn to share ideas and to help each other, which will make them mature and responsible people. They will be able to handle the problems in their lives and they will be able to build up strong relationships and they will be able to contribute to the welfare of their community. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think it is more beneficial for children to learn to cooperate. It is my belief that if children are taught to work together, they will grow up to be good people, who can work together to achieve success.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest."; Despite the argument that children should be taught to compete, others maintain that children should be taught to cooperate. Children who are taught to cooperate have the ability to communicate, understand, and solve problems. It is also important for children to learn how to be respectful and harmonious with others. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and they become more productive. It also prepares children for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to an individualistic attitude, so they become obsessed with their own success, and this can lead to anxiety, frustration, and low self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. Children who learn to work together and help each other develop into a well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adult. As they grow older and experience the complexity of the world, they will be better able to build good relationships, work together effectively, and help the community. Ultimately, teaching children to cooperate is the only way to raise a generation of people who are cooperative, compassionate, and successful.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.; For the writing task I have chosen: Whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has been a subject of discussion for many years among parents and educators. Some claim that competition is the best way to help children prepare for life and the workforce. In my opinion, the opposite is true: Teaching children to cooperate develops the ability to share, to understand others, and to solve problems. Cooperation also creates a sense of community and mutual respect, important for the development of close, long-term relationships. By working together, children learn to respect the strengths and weaknesses of others, and by doing so, the end result is a more cohesive and productive group. In a business setting, where collaboration and teamwork are prized, this helps them to be better prepared for their future roles as employees. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to a desire for personal success that is unhealthy and causes stress, lowered self-esteem, and increased anxiety when they fail. Competition can also foster an unhealthy emphasis on winning, which can lead to the need to compete in everything they do, to the point that they have lost all sense of fair play. Cooperation develops a more rounded, capable, and empathetic individual, which in turn enables them to cope with the complexities of real life and to be more productive and successful in their careers. In conclusion, while competition has its merits, I believe that in the long run it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of children who are empathetic, capable, and successful.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.; Discuss both views and give your opinion. The question of whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has sparked debate among parents and educators. While some claim that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I am of the opinion that children learn better when they cooperate with others. Cooperation develops communication, listening, empathy, and problem solving. Cooperation also engenders a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children cooperate to reach a common goal, they learn to recognize each other’s strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a more harmonious and productive group. In the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued, children learn how to work well with others and learn to work together as a team. Competition, on the other hand, teaches children to put their own interests first and to succeed at all costs, which can lead to the development of unhealthy self-esteem, anxiety and frustration. On the other hand, competition can lead to unhealthy egoism and a constant need to win, which can result in stress, anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem. Cooperation teaches children to share ideas and support each other. In doing so, they learn to develop strong social skills that will help them navigate the complicated social world. While there are certainly benefits to both cooperation and competition, I am of the opinion that a more productive and successful future lies in cooperation. Cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of compassionate, successful people.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or coexist has created heated discussions among teachers and parents. Some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, while others argue that teaching children to coexist is more useful to them as future adults. Coexisting creates a sense of community and respect for others, which is important for establishing strong relationships. It also teaches them how to operate as a team, which prepares them for the real world, where teamwork and group work are highly valued. However, a coexisting atmosphere can be detrimental to children's success because it may make them too dependent on others, making them prone to stress and anxiety. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a self-centred attitude where they place their success above others and this can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can be a cause of stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem. Consequently, I believe that by teaching children to coexist, they will become more successful, more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who can negotiate the complexities of the real world and help others more effectively. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, I believe that teaching them to coexist will be more beneficial in the long run. To teach children to coexist is to help them become empathetic, cooperative and successful.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has long been a source of controversy among educators and parents. While some argue that a spirit of competition is necessary for children to succeed in life, I firmly believe that cooperation is better than competition in developing useful adults. Cooperation engenders a sense of community and mutual respect that is essential to forming lasting relationships. When children work together toward a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and this gives them a good foundation for working together as a team in later life. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to unhealthy individualism and a desire to win at all costs, which can cause children to suffer when they encounter setbacks. Besides, if a child is taught to compete too early, he may grow up with a bad temper and low self-esteem. Cooperation enables children to learn to work together and to share their ideas, and this makes them better able to cope with the complexities of adult life. Cooperation, then, has its advantages, but I believe it is better in the long run to encourage children to cooperate. Cooperation is what creates a generation of adults who are compassionate, cooperative, and successful.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.; Discuss both views and give your opinion. I am firmly of the opinion that teaching children to compete is not the best way to make them useful adults in society. Cooperation is a much better thing to encourage, because it fosters respect and co-operation, which are essential to building strong and lasting relationships. Cooperation helps children to learn how to respect each other and recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this will be useful for them when they enter the world of adults, where the teamwork is highly valued. To encourage children to compete can create a highly stressful situation in which they are expected to succeed at any cost and undermines the idea of fair play and the importance of being a good sportsman. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may be too concerned with their own success and may develop an unhealthy obsession with winning, which will result in a lowered self-esteem and stress when they fail. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children how to work together, share ideas, and help each other, and this makes them more mature and useful members of society, capable of working in a team and producing positive results. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to work together will have a longer-term and more beneficial effect. Cooperation, rather than competition, is the key to producing a new generation of co-operating, successful, and happy members of society.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.; I think the reason why people are leaving their homes is that there is a lack of opportunities. I have a very strong opinion on this. I am strongly of the opinion that teaching children to compete rather than to co-operate has been a matter of much discussion among teachers and parents. I think that by teaching children to co-operate, they learn to respect each other’s differences, which in turn gives them a better understanding of each other in the future, when they will be working in a team and it will also help them to work in the future in a situation where collaboration and teamwork are important. The worst thing about teaching children to compete is that it creates a cutthroat atmosphere where children feel the need to win at all costs, which can lead to stress, depression and a lack of self-confidence. When children learn to co-operate, share and support each other, they become more mature, empathetic and productive adults, who will be able to understand each other better in the future and be able to work more effectively in a team and play a bigger role in society. In my opinion, although teaching children to compete has its advantages, teaching children to co-operate is a better way to go. In conclusion, I believe that teaching children to co-operate will help to create a generation of empathetic, successful and productive citizens.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.; . . . . . . . or . . . or something else? Explain your answer. Cooperation is a basis for friendship, and working together is an important part of growing up. Cooperation is the basis for mutual help. A child, therefore, should be taught to cooperate with others. Competition can be a basis for learning how to get ahead, but competition can lead to selfishness and a mistrust of others, which can lead to unhappiness and self-esteem, and to obsession with winning, which can lead to a great deal of stress and depression. Cooperation is better than competition. If children are taught to cooperate with others, they will become better adults, more empathetic, more productive, and more likely to build strong friendships, work together, and contribute to their community. Cooperation is, therefore, an important part of education and an essential skill for future success.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has given rise to fierce debates between educators and parents. It is claimed that to compete is essential for the success of children in later life, whereas it is maintained that cooperation makes them more useful adults. Cooperation between the students leads to greater self-esteem, respect for each other and the ability to work well with others. In the outside world, in the first case, the cooperation is valuable, in the second case, the ability to work well with others is rewarded. On the other hand, competition can lead to an overly individualistic attitude, to an unhealthy preoccupation with winning, to stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem in the face of failure. The more children are encouraged to work together, share their ideas and support each other, the more they develop into better rounded, more productive and empathetic adults. The more they learn to work with others, the better able they are to enter into a wide range of relationships, to work well in groups and to contribute to their community. In conclusion, it is my belief that, despite the value of competition, cooperation is a more effective way of educating children. Cooperation is necessary to help children grow into responsible, productive, empathetic and successful adults.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.; Discuss both views and give your own opinion. It is a subject of great debate whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate. Co-operation is important because it develops respect for others, and this is essential for a community to work well together. Cooperation prepares children for the real world where co-operation is valued. A too strong emphasis on competition may lead to a very individualistic way of thinking, with a strong emphasis on winning at all costs. This can lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to depression and anxiety when there is a failure. As a result of this, children may become adults who are more well-rounded, more empathetic, and better able to work together in the real world. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, in the long run it is more beneficial for children to learn to work together. Cooperation is the key to bringing up a generation of empathetic, co-operative and successful people.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.; The importance of teaching children to compete rather than to co-operate has long been a controversial issue amongst teachers and parents. While many argue that teaching children to compete rather than to co-operate is essential for their future success, I am convinced that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial for their future development as adults. Co-operation builds community and mutual respect, and enables children to build strong and lasting relationships. It is also the only way to ensure that children are ready for the world outside, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, which can cause children to lose their self-esteem and suffer from stress and anxiety when they encounter failure. By encouraging children to work together, support each other and share ideas, they will grow into mature, empathetic and productive adults, able to work in harmony with others and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, while it is important to teach children to compete, I believe that a co-operative approach is more beneficial in the long run. The success of society depends on the education of a new generation of children who are able to work together and share their ideas.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.; Why? The issue of whether to teach children to compete or to co-operate has always been the subject of discussion between parents and teachers. While some educators believe that it is essential to teach children to compete in order to make them future winners, others claim that it is better to teach them to co-operate in order to make them more useful people in the future. In my opinion, children who are taught to co-operate have more advantages than those who are taught to compete. Firstly, working together, children can understand each other’s weaknesses and strengths, which in turn will help them to work in harmony and produce more. Secondly, competition can make children selfish, making them think only of their own success. This can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, to problems in coping with setbacks, and to a loss of self-esteem. Thirdly, children who learn to co-operate with each other will grow into more well-balanced, empathetic and productive adults. When they reach the working-age level, they will be able to share ideas, work as part of a team, and become useful members of society. In conclusion, I would say that although competition has its advantages, teaching children to co-operate has a greater value. This is because it is essential for the future of a society that wants to raise up a generation of empathetic, team-working, and productive individuals.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.; Since this is a very controversial question, I want to explain my opinion. I believe that it is much more important to learn children to work together because they will be able to learn important social skills such as communication, listening, empathy and resolving problems. Besides, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for building strong and long-term relationships. When children work together on a task, they learn to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, and this makes them a more harmonious and more efficient team. In the real world, collaboration and teamwork are highly appreciated. Moreover, if children are taught to compete, it will create a competitive and cutthroat environment where they are forced to achieve at all costs, and this can undermine the value of fairness and sportsmanship. The most dangerous result of this is the obsession with winning, which will lead to anxiety, stress and self-esteem when they are unsuccessful. In short, if children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, they will become more mature, empathetic and productive adults, and they will have a better understanding of the real world, and will be able to work more efficiently as a team and contribute to the development of society. In conclusion, although there are many advantages to learning children to compete, I believe that teaching children to work together is more useful and more effective in the long run. It is necessary to raise a generation of successful, empathetic and cooperative adults.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.; How to train children to compete or cooperate has been the subject of intense discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to them as future adults. Cooperation also develops teamwork and trust, both essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this makes them better suited for the real world, where groupwork and collaboration are highly valued. Cooperation can also teach children not to be selfish and narcissistic. This can lead to self-esteem issues and self-doubt when they encounter failure. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which may result in stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to share ideas and support each other, which will make them more balanced, compassionate, and productive adults. In conclusion, although competition is also beneficial to children, teaching children to cooperate will ultimately prove more advantageous for their future lives. Cooperation is the only way to create a society of successful, compassionate, and hard-working individuals.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work."; This topic is a hotly debated topic in schools and families, where some parents believe that it is better to teach children to compete, arguing that they are more successful as adults. Others believe that children who are taught to cooperate become better and more useful adults. Cooperation also teaches children to share and respect each other, which is a great foundation for a long-lasting relationship. When children are taught to cooperate, they can appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and therefore be a good team and successful work together, which prepares them for the future world where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also teaches children to do things together, and to do them with a good conscience. Children who are taught to compete are said to have a much more individualistic mind, and an unhealthy focus on one's own success, which can lead to depression, stress and self-esteem when they encounter failure. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to support and help each other, and in this way children will become well-rounded, empathetic and useful adults. Cooperation is therefore beneficial to children and, in my opinion, will benefit them in the long run. Cooperation is thus an important part of raising a generation of empathetic, team-working and successful adults.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.; In the opinion of many teachers and parents, the question of whether to teach children to compete or to co-operate is an important one. Although some people think that teaching children to compete is important for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is better for their future development. Teaching children to co-operate helps them learn important social skills such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving. Furthermore, co-operation develops mutual respect, which is essential to building strong, lasting relationships. Moreover, by working together children learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and this enables them to work well as a group, and it is also important for their future success. As for teaching children to compete, it may result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, a deterioration of self-esteem, and increased stress when they fail. Then, as they grow into adulthood, if they learn to work together, share ideas, and help each other, they will become well-rounded, empathetic, and productive members of society. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I think that in the long run, teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial. And finally, teaching children to co-operate is essential for raising a generation of compassionate, successful, and successful citizens.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.; While some argue that children should be taught to compete, others believe that teaching them to cooperate is the best way to prepare them for future life. The argument between educators and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has become a major issue in recent years. Cooperation, on the other hand, creates a feeling of unity and mutual respect, and thus prepares children for future life. Cooperation also teaches children to work together, to value each other's strength and weaknesses, and to work together for a common goal. In this way, they are better prepared for the world of work, where cooperation and unity are highly valued. In addition, excessive emphasis on competition creates a cruel environment in which children feel that they must win at all costs, and destroys the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete, they will tend to think of their own success, and when they encounter obstacles, they will suffer from stress, anxiety, and will lose their self-esteem. Cooperation teaches children to work together, to share ideas, and to be united. Children who grow up in such a way will be more empathetic, more productive, and better able to deal with the complex world, and are better able to build strong relationships, work well in a team, and help others. This is the best way to raise a compassionate, united, and successful generation.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.; That the children of our country should be taught to compete or to collaborate is a matter of controversy among parents and educators. While some claim that it is necessary to teach the children to compete in order to make them good and successful people, I firmly believe that the children of our country should be taught to collaborate in order to make them good and effective people. According to me, it is very important for children to collaborate with each other from an early age. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, and thus they are trained to work together in harmony and productivity. Then, they will be prepared for life, where collaboration and teamwork are very important. Competition also gives rise to a sense of exploitation among children, and they are forced to achieve success at all costs, thereby undermining the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may have a selfish attitude towards life, which can make them less tolerant of failure, so that they lose their self-esteem. Children, on the other hand, should be taught to work together, share ideas and support each other, so that they can build strong and cohesive communities. In the end, I would like to say that competition has its advantages, but teaching children to collaborate is more beneficial in the long run. This will make children sensitive and helpful and successful.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.; The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has aroused a great deal of discussion among educators and parents. Although some people believe that competition is necessary for children to grow up successfully, I firmly believe that co-operation is more important in preparing children to become responsible adults. Co-operation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to building strong and lasting relationships. Besides, when children work together to accomplish a common task, they learn to appreciate each other's talents, which leads to the formation of a more cohesive and more productive group. An excessive emphasis on competition creates a hostile environment in which children feel compelled to win at all costs, thereby undermining the values of fair play and sportsmanship. Teaching children to compete instead of to work together teaches them to put their own success first and, as a result, they may suffer from stress and low self-esteem if they encounter failures. By contrast, children who are taught to work together, share ideas, and support each other develop into more well-rounded, compassionate, and productive adults. When they enter the adult world, they are better equipped to build strong relationships and work in a team to solve problems. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that the long-term benefits of encouraging children to work together outweigh the benefits of encouraging them to compete. In my opinion, teaching children to work together is the best way to develop a compassionate, team-oriented, and successful society.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.; Teaching children to cooperate, instead of compete, has long been a subject of discussion among parents and teachers. Some people claim that teaching children to compete is essential for future success, but I am of the opinion that teaching children to cooperate is better for the children's future success. Cooperation also encourages a feeling of community and mutual respect, which is important for building long-term relationships. In addition, children who work together towards a common goal learn to appreciate the skills and talents of others and they learn to get along with each other, which in turn prepares them for future life where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Competition on the other hand, can lead to a very individualistic attitude where they focus on their own success. When they fail, they are often anxious and lose their self-esteem, and they are in a bad mood. Cooperation will help them become well-rounded, compassionate and successful adults who can easily build good relationships and work in teams. In conclusion, although there are many benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is better for their future success. Children should be taught to cooperate, rather than compete, to help them develop into successful, compassionate and team-oriented adults.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.; I do not think the statement is accurate because it's useless to see animals living in cages and unable to move. If you teach children to compete, you teach them to succeed in the future, but I think that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for future adults. Cooperation develops a feeling of togetherness and mutual respect, which is useful for establishing strong and long-term relationships. Children who cooperate in achieving a common goal learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their fellow students, which helps them to be more harmonious and productive as a team. Moreover, they are more successful in a career where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, which leads to stress, anxiety and a loss of self-esteem when it is not achieved. On the other hand, competition can lead to the development of an unhealthy individualistic mentality that values personal success over that of others. In my opinion, by learning to share ideas, help and support each other, children develop into well-rounded, empathetic and more productive adults, who are better able to cope with the complexities of the real world and establish strong and lasting relationships. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some benefits, I think that cooperation is more useful in the long run. I also think that teaching children to cooperate is essential to raising a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.; In the society, there is a debate about whether to teach children to compete or to work together. Some say competition is necessary for their future, but I believe the teaching of cooperation is more beneficial in the development of the child. Cooperation will make them learn to appreciate and respect each other, which is important in building strong relationships. It will also prepare them for the outside world where teamwork is highly appreciated. Competition may result in unhealthy competition and a desire to win at all costs. They will become obsessed with winning, and if they lose they will be depressed and may lose their self-esteem. Cooperation is more important for them because they will be more social, empathetic and productive. Cooperation is the way to create a compassionate, cooperative and successful society.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.; This debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has been a hotly debated issue among educators and parents. Some people believe that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, while others believe that teaching children to co-operate is more useful in helping them to become useful adults. Co-operation builds a sense of community and mutual respect that is necessary for establishing strong, lasting relationships. In addition, when children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, and this makes them a more harmonious and productive team. In this sense, it is a better preparation for the world in which collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. In contrast, an overemphasis on competition creates a hostile and tense environment in which children are under constant pressure to achieve, sometimes ignoring the value of fair play and sportsmanship. Also, an unhealthy obsession with winning can cause anxiety and self-esteem problems, particularly if a child is ever prevented from achieving a goal. By contrast, when children are taught to work together, to share, and to support each other, they grow into empathetic, helpful and responsible adults who are better able to cope with the complexities of the real world and to contribute effectively to the communities in which they live. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some benefits, in the long run I believe that teaching children to co-operate is a more useful and long-term approach. In my view, it is a better way of preparing children for the world.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.; A. Whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has long been a topic of discussion among parents and educators. While some educators believe that children should be taught to compete to succeed in the future, I firmly believe that children should be taught to co-operate, and by doing so they can develop important social skills such as communication, compassion and problem-solving. Co-operation also fosters a sense of community and mutual respect that is crucial for building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and thus, the teamwork they develop can be a powerful force for good in their lives. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing them to become frustrated and anxious when they experience setbacks, thus affecting their self-esteem. And when they become more well-rounded, compassionate and productive adults, they will be better able to navigate the complexities of the world, build strong relationships and contribute to their communities. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete may have some benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate has more advantages in the long run. I firmly believe that if we teach children to co-operate rather than compete, we will raise a generation of more compassionate, more cooperative and more successful individuals.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days."; The task is very difficult for me because I have to choose one of two things. I believe that children should be taught to be sociable, as it is necessary for the development of a useful adult. The topic of raising children as competitors or cooperators has become the focus of great debate between educators and parents. Cooperation is a great way to build the foundation for the future of the children, so the children will be more successful and more productive, and this will be the main thing that will prepare them for the real world where teamwork is highly valued. Competition is a good way to develop the self-esteem of children, which is very useful for their future life, but too much competition can cause unhealthy competition, so that children are very dependent on winning, and they will be extremely upset and worried if they lose, and their self-esteem will also decrease. Cooperation helps children to become more successful, they will be able to build good relationships, cooperate with others and contribute to the community. In conclusion, competition is good for children, but in the long run, teaching children to be sociable is more useful. Cooperation in childhood is the basis for raising successful and compassionate people in the future.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future."; Cooperation is a more valuable and effective social skill than competition for the development of children than competition. While some educators and parents argue that children must be taught to compete in order to succeed in life, I believe that learning to cooperate is more beneficial for children in the long run. Cooperation engenders a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which will eventually lead to a more cohesive and productive group. This in turn prepares them for the real world, where the value of collaboration and teamwork is high. It also creates a cutthroat atmosphere where children feel pressured to win at all costs, which undermines the values of fair play and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which in turn may result in stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem. Cooperation allows children to work together, support one another and share ideas, thereby developing a better understanding of the benefits of sharing and supporting each other. This is vital for coping with the complex social structures that they will have to navigate as they enter adulthood. In conclusion, I believe that although teaching children to compete has some benefits, I believe that in the long run, children benefit more from being taught to cooperate. Cooperation, rather than competition, is essential to the development of a compassionate, productive and successful generation.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.; I have done the task: Teaching children to compete or to cooperate has sparked debate among teachers and parents for decades. Some people argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for future success. I do not think that is the case. Teaching children to cooperate gives them important social skills such as communication, understanding, cooperation and problem solving. Besides, children develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which is the foundation for long-term, sustainable relationships. When children work together on a common task, they learn to appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, which leads to a more cohesive and more effective team. Besides, children in a too-competitive environment are often encouraged to strive for success at any cost, and the value of fair play and good sportsmanship is ignored. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to an individualistic and egocentric approach to life, where they set their own success above the success of others, which can lead to a lack of self-esteem and reduced self-confidence when they encounter failures. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive people in life, who can negotiate the complexities of life, build stronger relationships and work more effectively in a team and contribute positively to society. In conclusion, although competition is beneficial, teaching children to cooperate in the long run is more beneficial. As such, it is the best way to raise a generation of compassionate, cohesive and successful people.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people."; This has been a long-standing debate among educators and parents: whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate? Some believe that learning to compete is essential for future success. I, on the other hand, believe that learning to cooperate is more beneficial for children in terms of their future lives. Cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which are critical for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues, which in turn makes for a harmonious and more productive group. In turn, this is important for future work where collaboration and teamwork are essential. Also, competition may create an environment where children feel forced to succeed at any cost, eroding a sense of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition may create an overly individualistic mindset, which may lead to a detrimental obsession with success, which can lead to anxiety and stress when the child is faced with obstacles. Cooperation creates well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults who are better able to navigate the complexities of the world, build strong relationships, and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that cooperation has more benefits in the long run. Cooperation is the foundation for successful, compassionate, and hardworking adults.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.; I strongly believe that teaching children to cooperate instead of compete is more beneficial for them in their future careers and their development. Some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, but I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for them in the future. Cooperation builds community and respect among students, and this helps them to form strong relationships and become more productive in the future. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they can learn each other's weaknesses and strengths, which will make them more productive and united as a team. In the real world, collaboration and unity are highly valued. It is also worth noting that competition, if it is over-emphasized, will lead to an unhealthy focus on success at all costs and undermining fairness and sportsmanship. On the contrary, teaching children to compete can lead to the formation of a selfish mindset in which they want to achieve success at the expense of others, and when they fail, they will feel anxious and depressed. Cooperation builds community and respect among students. It is my view that students who learn to share ideas and help each other will be able to form strong relationships, work together well, and contribute to the community in the future. In summary, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for them in the long run. Ultimately, the success of the community depends on the successful development of the children.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.; When children are given a chance to work, they develop social skills like good communication, negotiating, empathy and the ability to resolve conflicts. While some people claim that the best way to prepare children for their future success is to teach them to compete, I am sure that it is more useful to teach them to work together, as this makes them better people as adults. Also, cooperation makes people trust each other and form strong relationships, which is important for building a strong community. Children who work together towards the same goal learn to appreciate each other's skills and limitations, which helps them build stronger and more productive teams. And as the world of work values collaboration and teamwork, so will their children. An excessively competitive environment makes children feel a constant pressure to win at all costs, which ruins the sense of fair play and solidarity. On the other hand, teaching children to compete gives them a very individualistic outlook on life, making them too obsessed with success and achievements, which in turn causes them a lot of stress, anxiety and a drop in self-esteem when they face failure. Cooperation develops in children the ability to work together, share ideas and support each other, which makes them more well-rounded, empathetic and productive people as adults. In my opinion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is essential for raising a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.; To teach children to compete or to co-operate is a question that has been the subject of discussion between educators and parents for centuries. I firmly believe that children should be taught to co-operate. This enables children to develop such skills as communication, empathy, understanding, and problem-solving. For this reason, children are well prepared for the real world, where co-operation is highly valued. When children work together, they learn to respect and appreciate the differences between them. In contrast, too much emphasis on competition may lead to a cut-throat environment in which children feel they must win at any cost. This can result in unhealthy obsession with winning and in stress, anxiety, and a loss of self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. If children learn to co-operate, they become more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults who are able to navigate the complexities of the real world and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some advantages, I believe that co-operation is more beneficial in the long run. And it is essential if we want to raise a generation of compassionate, successful, and productive adults.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.; Cooperation or competition: the most important for children? Cooperation or competition: this question has always been the subject of heated debates between teachers and parents. Although it has been argued that competition is the most important for children, it has been argued that children who are taught to cooperate are more beneficial than adults. Cooperation teaches children the essential social skills of communication, tolerance, sympathy and problem solving. Cooperation also promotes mutual trust and respect, which is the foundation for a strong and lasting relationship. Children who work together in a team will learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and they will be able to work more efficiently and effectively. This will also prepare them for the real world where cooperation and teamwork are important. Competition on the other hand, when children are encouraged too much, can lead to a more selfish, unhealthy and inflexible attitude, and the lack of fairness and sportsmanship. However, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy focus on self-interest, which can lead to anxiety, stress and lack of self-esteem when faced with setbacks. Cooperation can help children to grow into more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults who are able to cope with the complexities of the real world, build strong relationships, and work more effectively with others. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation is essential for the development of a generation of compassionate, hardworking and successful people.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.; Take for example the following text: The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together has aroused great interest among parents and teachers. Some say that children should be taught to compete in order to make them more successful in the future. I believe that teaching children to work together is more useful in shaping their personality and developing their social skills. In addition, working together creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong, lasting relationships. Also, working together helps children to learn the advantages and disadvantages of cooperation, which prepares them for life, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Also, too much competition can make children selfish and self-centred, and undermining their sense of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can make them too individualistic and focused on their own success, which can lead to stress, anxiety and self-esteem problems when they fail. Teaching children to work together enables them to develop their social skills and be more effective and productive in the future. In my opinion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to work together has long-term benefits. In conclusion, teaching children to work together helps to create a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.; . . . What is your opinion? “Is it better to teach children to compete or cooperate?” is a topic that has long been the subject of debate among educators and parents. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches a sense of community and mutual respect that helps to develop stronger relationships. And children learn to respect one another by working together toward a common goal, thus preparing them for the real world where a sense of collaboration and teamwork is highly valued. Also, if competition is overemphasized, children may feel pressured to achieve at any cost, and that can make them lose their self-esteem and self-confidence when they encounter failure. But teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy emphasis on the individual and their own self-interest, and may result in stress, anxiety, and lowered self-esteem if they fail. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to work together, to share ideas, to care about each other, and to take responsibility for their own actions, and that makes them better prepared for the challenges of the real world, where they will have to build strong relationships, work in teams, and help to contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to both competition and cooperation, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will have a greater long-term benefit. Cooperation is the key to raising a new generation of caring, cooperative, and successful individuals.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate."; . If you don't agree, explain why. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has recently become a source of intense debate between teachers and parents. Although some firmly believe that competition is necessary for future success, I firmly believe that cooperation is more useful for children's development. Cooperation is also a sense of community and mutual respect that helps children establish strong friendships, which is useful in their lives after school. The fact that children can learn to get along with each other and learn to work together for a long time will be useful to them in their future careers, because teamwork and cooperation are often the most important aspects of life. A competition-based school system may also lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, causing stress, anxiety and self-esteem when they meet failure. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they will become more selfish, and if they are not able to achieve success in life, they will become very resentful and have a lack of self-esteem. By learning to cooperate, share ideas and build friendships, children are more able to meet the complexities of life and become better people, better able to establish relationships with others, be able to work with others and make contributions to the community. In short, although competition has its own advantages, I think that the most important thing is to teach children to cooperate. Educating children to cooperate is the best way to raise people with compassion and ability to achieve success.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.; Professors spend a lot of time doing research. But I strongly believe that professors should spend more time teaching students to work in groups and solve problems together. This discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or work together has aroused great interest in parents and educators. Children who learn to work together learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, so they will work better in the future, because the modern world, which highly values collaboration, requires them to work together. . On the other hand, children who are taught to compete have an overly individualistic mindset and they become obsessed with winning and become anxious, have low self-esteem, and are afraid of losing. , they will become mature people who can do well and solve problems in the future. Cooperation makes them mature people. Because of this, they are able to work together and solve problems.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.; Whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has been a source of debate among educators and parents. Although some people argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to them. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical to establishing strong, long-lasting relationships. Also, children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses as they work together, and that prepares them for the world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation can also eliminate the unhealthy stress of wanting to win and lose, and lead to the onset of low self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a narrow, self-centered mindset that focuses on personal success, and when they are faced with failure, they can suffer from anxiety and depression. As a result, children learn to share their ideas and support each other, which makes them better prepared to deal with the complexities of the real world, and to contribute positively to society. Although both cooperation and competition have their advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to their long-term development. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate is an essential part of raising a generation of compassionate, cooperative, and successful individuals.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.; Cooperation and competition between children have always been the subject of debate between parents and educators. While some people argue that teaching children to compete is the most effective way to teach them to succeed in the future, I am sure that teaching children to cooperate will give them more useful skills in life. Cooperation can create a community of mutual trust and respect, which is an important basis for the formation of a relationship. When children work together to achieve the same goal, they can appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and become a more harmonious and productive team, and the work will be more meaningful. In the future, people in different fields will have to work together to achieve their goals. Cooperation is a prerequisite for a person to succeed in life. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an individualistic consciousness that only cares about personal success, causing them to lose self-esteem when they fail, and they are more inclined to play by themselves, and this will make them even more prone to competition. I am sure that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. If children can learn to share and work together, they will grow into a more well-rounded, empathetic, and able to achieve more, and they will be able to achieve more in their careers and work in their communities in the future. Ultimately, teaching children to cooperate is an important way to nurture a generation of empathetic, cooperative, and successful people.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.; Teaching children to work together can help them develop essential social skills such as listening, sharing, understanding and problem solving. The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or work together has become an important topic of debate among parents and teachers. While some people claim that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I believe that teaching children to work together will benefit them more in the future. In the first place, working together can help children understand the importance of the relationship between each other, and when they cooperate with each other, they are more willing to learn and help each other, which is useful for the later development of society. Secondly, the benefit of working together is that it can help children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and lead to a more harmonious and productive team. Third, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause anxiety and self-esteem problems when they are exposed to failure. On the contrary, teaching children to compete leads to an egocentric mentality that emphasizes the individual's success over the success of others. In the end, by teaching children to work together, children will be more well-rounded, empathic and productive adults, and as they enter the complex world of adults, they are better able to establish close friendships, work as a team and achieve common goals. Therefore, although competition has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. I think that teaching children to work together is essential for the development of a harmonious and harmonious society.
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.; If you want to compete with other people, you must have the skills of communication, empathy and problem solving. If you want to cooperate, you will have the skills of communication, empathy and solving problems. The argument that children should be taught to compete with others rather than to work together is a topic of debate between educators and parents. Cooperation teaches children to work together in harmony and effectively, which prepares them for the future of work and life, where cooperation and mutual respect are highly valued. Cooperation makes children recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a more harmonious and productive team. Cooperation also teaches children to be fair and fair, as well as to act in harmony. Competition, on the other hand, makes children more individualistic and prone to the success of one's own achievement. If the child fails, he will be extremely disappointed and his self-esteem will suffer. Cooperation makes children become more responsible, empathetic and harmonious adults. Children will be able to cope better with the complexity of the world around them and, in the future, be able to build strong relationships and work effectively in groups. In conclusion, although there are advantages to both methods, I believe that it is more useful to teach children to work together than to compete. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of successful, empathetic and harmonious people.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;" ; Children should be taught to compete or coexist. The argument that teaches children to compete is useful for their future, while others argue that they should be taught to coexist is more useful for them to grow up. Cooperation teaches children to develop a variety of social skills, such as communication, empathy, and decision-making. Cooperation also enhances the sense of community and mutual respect, which is very useful for the formation of lasting relationships. Children will also know the strengths and weaknesses of each other and are able to appreciate the value of working together. When they work together for a long time, they can understand the advantages and disadvantages of each other, so they will be able to cooperate and work well. However, competition is an individualistic way of thinking, which is often obsessed with individual success and will lead to individual anxiety, which will lead to self-esteem and other psychological problems. Moreover, competition is a destructive tendency that wants to succeed at all costs, which will make children lack the awareness of the importance of fairness and self-esteem. Children who are used to working together, sharing ideas, and helping each other, will grow up to be more well-rounded, empathic, and productive people, who are better able to live in a complex world, make good friends, work in teams, and work together to create more value. In short, although there is a certain benefit to teaching children to compete, I personally think that teaching children to coexist will benefit them more in the long run. Cooperation is the most important way to cultivate a new generation of people who have empathy, work together, and can achieve common goals."
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.; The education of children, to compete or to coexist, has become a topic of debate among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is the most important for their future success, I would say that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in making them a useful adult. Furthermore, it is the basis of developing mutual respect and building strong relationships. By working together for a common goal, children can appreciate the advantages and disadvantages of each other, which is a very useful lesson in a society where the importance of teamwork and coexistence is increasing. In addition, competition creates a cutthroat atmosphere where children feel they must succeed at any cost, and at the same time it can destroy the sense of fairness and sportsmanship. But competition also teaches children to be selfish and self-reliant, so they may feel overwhelmed by failure, suffer from depression and anxiety, and lose self-esteem. With the ability to work together, share ideas, and support each other, children can grow into useful, empathetic, and successful adults. Finally, while there is some benefit to teaching children to compete, I believe that children who are taught to coexist have a greater long-term benefit. In conclusion, teaching children to coexist is a better way to create a generation of useful, empathetic, and successful adults.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.; To compete or to cooperate? In the meantime, there is still a fierce debate among educators and parents on whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate. Cooperation is good for building community, and it is the key to long-lasting friendships. When children cooperate, they can learn to value each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this is very good preparation for life. In addition, competition can be a ruthless environment, where children feel the pressure to win at all costs, and undermine the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the contrary, teaching children to compete can lead to excessive individualism, the pursuit of personal success at the expense of others, resulting in excessive anxiety, depression and low self-esteem when they are rejected. Cooperation can produce more flexible, more caring, more productive people. In the face of the real world's complexity, they are more capable of building relationships, working together and making contributions. In short, although competition has its own benefits, in my view, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial. Cooperation is the foundation for raising a generation of empathetic, united and successful people.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close."; Explain your answer. During the course of my life, I have heard a great deal of talk about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. I firmly believe that co-operation is the best thing for children to learn, for it is a much more beneficial way of life. Also, co-operation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is vital for establishing strong, lasting relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate the different talents and abilities of their fellow students. This enables them to work more harmoniously and productively as a team and thereby prepares them for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly prized. On the other hand, too much emphasis on competition may lead to an unhealthy emphasis on personal achievement, which in turn leads to a lack of teamwork and an undermining of the values of fairness and sportsmanship. The stress of competing can lead to depression and a loss of self-confidence when they encounter failures. Children who learn to work together, share their ideas, and support each other will grow up to be well-adjusted, compassionate, and productive adults who will be better able to navigate the complex social situations they will face as adults. In conclusion, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is ultimately more beneficial to them. Children who learn to co-operate will grow into compassionate, productive, and successful adults.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.; A debate is raging among educators and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. While some say that competition is necessary for children’s future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate would help them to be good and useful adults. In addition, cooperation creates community and mutual respect, which are essential for building a strong and lasting relationship. The best preparation for future life is to work with others and accept each other’s strengths and weaknesses. It is also unhealthy for children to feel they must win at all costs. This can lead to anxiety and a lack of self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to unhealthy individualism. Cooperation builds a cohesive and sympathetic group of people who are able to work together to solve problems. As adults, they will be able to form good relationships, work together effectively, and play a useful role in society. In conclusion, although there are advantages to competition, it seems to me that cooperation is a more important goal in the long run. It is a better way to teach children to be empathetic, cooperative, and successful.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.; Regardless of how one brings up children, teaching them to compete or cooperate has always been an issue of debate among educators and parents. While some believe that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate will be more useful for them as future adults. Teaching children to cooperate will teach them the necessary social skills such as communication, the ability to deal with different opinions, to communicate, to share and to solve problems. Furthermore, cooperation develops community and mutual respect, which is the foundation for long-term relationships. In addition, by working together for a common goal, children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes them more cohesive and efficient. Finally, they are better prepared for the outside world, where teamwork and teamwork are highly appreciated. Competition, on the other hand, leads to an overly individualistic attitude, which focuses on success and causes children to feel anxious, uneasy and lacking in self-esteem when they fail. In addition, competition creates a cutthroat environment in which children feel the need to win at all costs, which is contrary to the rules of fairness and equality. Consequently, children learn to work together, support each other and share ideas, which makes them more capable of building relationships, working in teams and contributing to society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to cooperate will be more useful for them in the long run. In the end, raising a generation of children who cooperate is the best way to make sure they are compassionate, cooperative and successful in life.
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.; Do you think that children should be taught to compete or to work together? The debate between parents and educators about whether to teach children to compete or to work together has a lot of momentum. Some people think that children should be taught to compete, others that cooperation is more useful. Cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, and builds strong relationships. It also prepares children for the outside world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Besides, an overly competitive environment can lead to a cutthroat atmosphere where children feel they have to achieve at any cost, and where fairness and the value of sportsmanship are lost. Teaching children to compete, on the other hand, can lead to a very individualistic attitude, where they have a strong focus on their own success, and it can lead to an unhealthy focus on winning and loss of self-esteem when they have to fail. When children learn to work together, share ideas, and support each other, they grow into more balanced, empathetic, and productive adults. They are better able to build strong relationships, work in a team, and be of greater service to society. In conclusion, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. When children learn to work together, they grow into more caring, cooperative, and successful people.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.; Discuss both views and give your own opinion. The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or coexist has always sparked lively discussions among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial for them to become useful adults. Coexistence leads to a sense of unity and mutual respect, which is vital to establishing long-lasting friendships. By working together to achieve a common goal, children will learn to appreciate the differences in their fellow students, and it will prepare them for the world of work where collaboration and teamwork are valued. The atmosphere of competition, on the other hand, is often fierce and insensitive, putting too much pressure on children to win at all costs. It can lead to a strong desire to win, which in turn will make them feel depressed, anxious and guilty when they encounter failure. Coexistence develops in children a strong sense of solidarity, making them more empathetic, supportive and responsible. They will be better equipped to face the complexity of the real world, forge stronger relationships and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete does have its merits, I believe that teaching them to coexist is more useful for their future. It will enable them to establish harmonious relationships and live productive and fulfilling lives.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.; The debate about whether to teach children to compete or to cooperate has become an important issue among educators and parents. While some say that children should be taught to compete, this is necessary for future success, I think it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Children learn cooperation skills like listening, speaking, listening, and empathy. Cooperation is also necessary for the development of the community and mutual respect, which will be able to form strong relationships in the future. Cooperation does not make children aggressive and create a good environment for promoting fair competition and sportsmanship. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may have a solitary view of life, they are too obsessed with the pursuit of success, and they may feel depression and anxiety when they encounter failure. Cooperation can develop children into people who can share, work together and support each other. As they grow up, they will be able to establish good relationships, work in a team and play a role in the community. In my opinion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial. Cooperation is the foundation for the next generation to learn how to share, work together and achieve success.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.; In this task you are supposed to convince the reader of your opinions. The argument between educating children to compete and to cooperate has been a source of great controversy for parents and educators for a long time. I believe that children who are taught to cooperate are more able to become socially useful people in the future than children who are taught to compete. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, and enables people to build long-lasting and strong relationships. Cooperation also enables children to be more understanding and accepting of each other’s weaknesses, and thus, cooperate better and more effectively in the real world. Competition, on the other hand, may lead to a very individualistic outlook and an unhealthy obsession with success, which in turn, may lead to stress, anxiety and loss of self-esteem. Competition enables children to learn to become more independent and able to manage their lives better, but cooperation enables children to become more cohesive and able to learn to build relationships and work in teams. Cooperation also enables children to learn how to work together in harmony and to solve problems as a group. Cooperation is the key to raising a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident."; The debate between whether it is better to teach children to compete or to cooperate has aroused considerable interest among both teachers and parents. Some argue that children must be taught to compete if they are to be a success in later life. I am convinced that it is better to teach children to cooperate than to compete. Cooperation is an important basis for building strong relationships, and it also prepares children for the world outside, where teamwork and cooperation are more highly valued. When children work together they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which makes for a more harmonious and effective team, which is also useful when they go on to the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are so important. Besides, competition creates an unhealthy competition and puts too much emphasis on winning and not enough on fair play and respect for others. Children who are taught to compete may well become too individualistic and thus may suffer from a lack of self-esteem when they have setbacks in their career, because they put themselves before others. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas and support each other, which will make them better able to cope with the world outside and be more useful to their communities. In conclusion, I believe that it is more beneficial for children to learn to cooperate than to compete. Cooperation is the key to the successful, well-balanced and successful children.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.; A discussion on whether it is better to teach children to compete or coexist is being held by parents and teachers. While some argue that competition is more important for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to coexist is more useful for the growth of useful adults. Coexistence brings out the best in children and gives them a community of respect, which is important for building long-term relationships. Also, when children work together to accomplish something, they learn to appreciate each other's differences, which is useful for the achievement of a common goal, and this prepares them for the world of work, where collaboration and group effort are highly valued. To encourage competition instead of coexistence, however, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause anxiety and fear of failure. In addition, if competition is stressed too much, the sportsmanship and fairness of sportsmanship are lost, and this makes children disappointed and anxious. To work together, share and help one another, children will become better, more understanding and more useful people. It will be easier for them to cope with the complexities of the world of work and to cooperate with others. In conclusion, competition has its advantages, but I believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial for their future lives. It will produce a new generation of children who understand others, who can work together and who can achieve success.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.; Teaching children to work together helps them develop the essential social skills of communication, understanding, and problem-solving. It is an ongoing debate among teachers and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or work together. Cooperation, in addition, creates a feeling of unity and respect for others, which is essential to build lasting relationships. In the real world, people are valued for their ability to work together. Cooperation also creates a positive attitude towards fair play and other good sportsmanship qualities. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with their own success, which can lead to the stress, anxiety, and lack of self-esteem when they fail. Children who learn to work together, share ideas, and support one another grow into adults who are more empathetic, successful, and helpful in their careers and communities. In my opinion, despite the benefits of teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to work together will be more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation in education, in my view, is the only way to raise the next generation of compassionate, successful, and cooperative adults.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?; On the one hand, there is a debate amongst parents and educators about whether it is better to teach children to compete or to co-operate. Some say that children should be taught to compete for the sake of their future success, while others believe that children should be taught to co-operate. In my opinion, the children should be taught to co-operate more. As for co-operation, the children will become more united, which in turn makes it easier for them to form strong and lasting relationships with each other. Moreover, children will learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which will in turn make them better able to work together in the future, where the teamwork and co-operation are highly valued. For example, when a child is given an excessive amount of homework, it may lead to stress, anxiety and self-esteem if they experience failure. On the other hand, teaching children to compete, may lead to the development of selfish behavior, where they put themselves ahead of others. Moreover, this may result in unhealthy obsession with winning, which will lead to mental health problems and a lack of self-esteem when they encounter failure. Children, who learn to work together and help each other, will become more empathetic, more sociable and more productive people. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I think it is better to teach children to co-operate. In order to raise a generation of empathetic, co-operative and successful people, teaching children to co-operate is essential.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.; The discussion of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has sparked a heated debate among educators and parents. Some believe that teaching children to compete is essential for future success. I strongly disagree. Cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which is the foundation of any long-term relationship. When children cooperate, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this prepares them for the real world where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, an overemphasis on competition can lead to a cutthroat attitude and reduce the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can result in an unhealthy focus on individual success, which may lead to anxiety, frustration, and a loss of self-esteem when faced with obstacles. Cooperation builds children into well-rounded, well-adjusted, and more productive adults. They are better able to handle the complexities of the real world, and they will be better able to maintain good relationships, work well with others, and contribute to the community. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is ultimately more beneficial. I believe that teaching children to cooperate is the best way to raise a compassionate, cooperative, and successful generation.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.; Discuss both views and give your reasons for your answer. The topic of whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has been discussed extensively by both parents and teachers, but I am firmly of the opinion that it is much more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Teaching children to cooperate develops their social skills of communication, empathy and the ability to solve problems. Cooperation also helps children to build a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential to the formation of lasting relationships. When children cooperate, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and work together more efficiently as a result. This will also prepare them for a future working environment where teamwork is highly valued. Besides, teaching children to compete fosters unhealthy obsession with winning at all costs, which in turn may lead to stress, anxiety and a drop in self-esteem when they encounter failure. In my view, teaching children to compete is less beneficial than teaching them to cooperate. Cooperation develops well-rounded, well-adjusted, empathetic and productive adults who are able to cope with the complexities of the real world. In my opinion, teaching children to cooperate will have a positive effect on their future lives. It is essential to raising a generation of compassionate, efficient and successful adults.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.; You will probably have heard the opinions of the competition and the cooperation of the educationists. While some claim that competition is the most important thing for a child, the cooperation is the most important thing for children. Cooperation is an important tool for children to develop their social skills, communication, sensitivity, and the ability to solve problems. In addition, cooperation builds solidarity and mutual respect, and the establishment of a group is the basis for the development of long-term relationships. Also, children, when they work together towards a common goal, learn to appreciate the differences in each other, and thus are better prepared for the world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, an environment that overly emphasizes competition can lead to a vicious environment where children feel the need to win at any cost, which will make them lose their respect for honesty and fairness. On the other hand, competition leads to an individualistic attitude, which means that success is more important than other people, and this unhealthy obsession with success leads to anxiety, tension and low self-esteem. Cooperation helps children become well-rounded, kind, helpful, and successful adults, and as they enter the complex world of adults, they will have the tools to build relationships, work as a team, and be a positive influence on society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think that in the long run, cooperation is more beneficial. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of individuals with sensitivity, teamwork and success.
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.; I think it is better to have a teacher. Teaching children to compete with each other has long been a subject of debate between teachers and parents. While some people argue that children need to be taught to compete for future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate will help them become useful adults. Cooperation is a social activity that creates a sense of unity and mutual respect that is necessary for building long-term relationships. Children who work together towards the same goal learn to respect each other and understand each other, which makes them more harmonious and more productive as a group. Cooperation also teaches children to be fair and fair in their actions, which in turn makes them better team players. Teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy individualistic attitude that is only concerned with their own success and can lead to anxiety and low self-esteem when they experience setbacks. Cooperation teaches children to share their ideas and work together, and children will develop into more well-rounded, more empathetic and more productive adults as they move into the world. Cooperation is more beneficial in the long run than competition. Cooperation is the way to go to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful individuals.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.; Here are some topics for you: (Growing up) Cooperation or competition - is a debate among educators and parents. While others argue that competition is essential for the future of the child, I think that teaching the child to cooperate will help the child more to grow up. Cooperation develops the child's ability to establish and maintain relationships in the community. Also, the child will be able to work in a team and will be able to appreciate each other's talents and weaknesses, and he will be ready for life, where teamwork is highly valued. It also develops the sense of fairness and fairness in the child. On the other hand, competition makes the child an individualist and puts him in the forefront of his own success, and, in case of failure, he is in despair and low self-esteem. Cooperation brings up children who can work together, share ideas and support each other. They are more likely to develop into more harmonious, empathetic and productive adults who are able to maintain good relationships, work effectively in teams and be beneficial to their communities. In conclusion, competition has its benefits, but I think it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation is a necessity to raise a compassionate, harmonious and successful generation.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.; Whether or not to teach children to compete or cooperate has been a matter of debate among educators and parents. Some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for future success, but I think that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for the development of people. Co-operation builds a strong sense of community and respect for others, which is very important for building good relationships. Cooperation also helps children to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and in the future, they will be able to work together more easily and become more productive. If children are taught to compete too much, they will feel that they have to win at all costs, and will be discouraged by the injustice of the situation. On the other hand, teaching children to compete often makes them think that their own success is more important than others, so they are too focused on winning, and if they encounter obstacles, they will become disappointed and lose their self-esteem. Cooperation teaches children to share, support each other, and learn from each other, and as they grow up, they will have more empathetic thinking and more teamwork, which is a better foundation for them to learn in a more complex world. In short, a compassionate, cooperative, and successful society requires children to be raised in a cooperative environment.
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.; Teaching children to work together in groups teaches them to communicate, negotiate, empathize, and solve problems. Whether it is better to teach children to compete or work together has aroused a lot of controversy between educators and parents. And the most important thing is that by working together, children learn to be cooperative and respect each other, which is important in building friendships and long-term relationships. Besides, the focus on competition can lead to a cutthroat environment where children are encouraged to win at all costs, ignoring the value of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the contrary, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which leads to high levels of stress, anxiety, and self-esteem, especially when they encounter setbacks. Besides, by working together, children learn to share, support and help each other, which can help them build strong relationships, work together in teams, and contribute to society more positively. In short, although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I think teaching children to work together is more advantageous. It is not only useful in helping children learn to work together, but it is also necessary for the education of the whole society to develop well.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.; It is often said that children should be taught to compete instead of being taught to coexist. However, I believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial than teaching them to compete. Teaching children to coexist also teaches them how to communicate, sympathize and solve problems. It is also important for building long-term relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they will understand the difference between the strengths and weaknesses of each other, and they will have a greater understanding of each other, which will make the team more harmonious and more productive. This will also help children to be prepared for the world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. A greater emphasis on competition will also result in a cutthroat atmosphere, where children are under great pressure to succeed, and erode the values of fairness and sportsmanship. On the contrary, teaching children to compete will make them more individualistic, leading to a loss of self-esteem and other problems if they are unsuccessful. Coexisting children will develop into more mature, empathic and more productive adults. In the future, they will be able to build good relationships with others, work more effectively in teams and make a better contribution to society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to coexist will have more long-term benefits. Therefore, it is important to teach children to coexist to help them grow up to be more cooperative and sympathetic.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.; On the question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate, the discussion has always been very lively among educators and parents. Some say that competition is necessary for the future success of the children, but I am sure that cooperation will make them more valuable adults. Cooperation teaches the children the sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to build strong, lasting relationships. In the end, this will make them more able to work together as a team when they enter society, where teamwork and cooperation are highly valued. And, if the children are too much on competition, it will make them too concerned with winning at all costs, and that will destroy the fair play and the concept of mutual help. The opposite will make them too individualistic and obsessed with winning. Then they will be disappointed, have lower self-esteem, and if they will be exposed to new situations, they will be less willing to try new things and learn new skills. Cooperation will make them into better, more empathetic and more successful adults. . . . In short, although there are advantages to both, I think it is more useful to teach children to cooperate than to compete. Cooperation is the key to creating compassionate, cooperative, and successful people.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.; Give your reasons and examples. It has long been a controversial issue among educators and parents whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. The debate continues to this day, and it is my opinion that teaching children to work together is the best way to teach them how to be good citizens. For one thing, working together helps to foster a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to forming long-term relationships. When children work together they learn to appreciate each other’s talents and weaknesses, and this makes them better prepared for the real world, where working together is an important part of success. Then, too, too much emphasis on competition can create an unhealthy obsession with winning at any cost, which can lead to anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when children are faced with failure. By contrast, teaching children to compete may result in them developing a more individualistic approach to life, where their own success is more important than the success of others. When children learn to share their ideas and work together they develop into more empathetic, productive and cooperative adults, who are better able to cope with the challenges of a fast-changing world. In my opinion, while there may be some advantages to teaching children to compete, the benefits of a culture of cooperation far outweigh those. In the end, it is my view that the best way to raise a successful and happy generation is to teach children to work together.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.; This debate between parents and teachers is still a point of contention, and I think that if a child is taught to compete rather than cooperate, this is detrimental to his success in later life. In contrast, I think that encouraging children to cooperate can only benefit them as they become adults. Besides the obvious fact that it teaches a child to work together, cooperation also teaches mutual respect and understanding, and this is essential in forming a good relationship with others. And finally, as the child begins to work in a group, he learns to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of his colleagues, and this will serve him well when he enters the workforce, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Moreover, the pressure to win at all costs can be unhealthy, and children may end up being frustrated and angry when they are unable to succeed. In contrast, encouraging children to compete teaches them to think only of themselves and this can lead to unhealthy self-obsession, which can result in a drop in self-esteem and an inability to cope with failure. By learning to share ideas and cooperate with each other, children will grow into more confident and productive adults who will be able to handle the complexities of the modern world and work more effectively with their colleagues. In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I believe that encouraging children to cooperate has a far more lasting effect on their success in life. A generation of compassionate, co-operative and successful individuals must be taught to cooperate.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.; The ability to work with others is an important social ability. Those who develop these skills are more likely to become useful and caring people. The debate between the teaching of children to compete or to coexist has caused a lot of controversy among teachers and parents. Moreover, teamwork can develop the sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for establishing strong and lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve the same goal, they can appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and they can be a harmonious and effective team. This will also be an important lesson for them in the future when they have to live in society, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. But teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, and they may have a lack of self-esteem and lose confidence if they fail. In my opinion, teaching children to coexist will have a long-term beneficial effect on their lives, and by working together, sharing ideas, and being supportive, they can become a more well-rounded, empathetic, and successful person in the future. Finally, teaching children to coexist is essential for the formation of a caring and successful society.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television."; Discuss both sides and give your opinion. The issue of whether or not children should be taught to compete or cooperate has caused much discussion among parents and educators. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I am of the opinion that teaching children to cooperate is much more beneficial for them in the long run. Cooperation, rather than competition, develops the kind of sense of community and mutual respect that is essential to building strong, lasting relationships. By working together towards a common goal, children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to form a cohesive and productive team. It also enables children to develop a sense of fair play and sportsmanship, which can be lost if they are constantly pressured to achieve. In contrast, teaching children to compete fosters an unhealthy emphasis on personal achievement, which can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress and anxiety, and a lack of self-esteem, if they are unsuccessful. Children who learn to share ideas, work together, and help each other to succeed develop into more well-rounded, successful, and empathetic adults, who are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the real world, where they must work together as a team, and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although competition can have its benefits, in the long run, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is much more beneficial for them. Children who learn to cooperate rather than compete will develop into a generation of compassionate, productive, and successful adults.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.; Why? Cooperation in schools is also an issue. Cooperation in schools is considered by some to be essential for future success, while others argue that it develops important social skills in children, such as sharing, negotiating, and solving problems. Moreover, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important for building relationships. Cooperation in schools is very important for children, because they are expected to work as a team in their daily lives. Also, too much emphasis on competition in schools creates an unhealthy obsession with winning, which leads to a decrease in self-esteem and mental illness, when children are unable to overcome obstacles and fail. On the other hand, competition can lead to the individualization of children and make them less concerned about others' success and less obsessed with winning, which could lead to stress, depression and self-esteem problems. Cooperation, however, teaches children to share and help each other, and this is how they become a more solid and friendly adult, who knows how to communicate, build relationships and take on the world. To conclude, although competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation is better for children in the long run. Cooperation in schools is a very important thing to develop in children.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.; That statement has generated a lot of controversy among educators and parents, some arguing that the ability to compete is important for the success of children in life, others arguing that teaching children to work together and cooperate is more beneficial for the success of children. However, if we are to develop our children’s ability to relate well to others, then the skills of communication, cooperation, sympathy, and problem-solving must be developed in children. Besides, working together gives children a sense of community and respect, and that is a crucial basis for building a good relationship. As children work together, they learn to respect and appreciate each other’s talents, and that is essential for building a good relationship. And that is also an advantage for children when they enter a society where cooperation and teamwork are so highly valued. Further, too much competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause a lot of anxiety, stress, and self-esteem problems when they encounter adversity. As children learn to work together, they develop more understanding, empathetic, and productive adults, who will be able to deal with the complexities of the real world and help build strong relationships, work effectively in a team, and contribute positively to their communities. To sum up, while there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I think it is better for children to be taught to work together and cooperate. As we teach children to work together, we are encouraging them to be compassionate, cooperative, and successful.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.; and the knowledge of their importance and its value in everyday life. The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has become a matter of controversy among educators and parents. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate will make them better as adults than to compete. In addition, co-operation teaches mutual respect, and therefore builds relationships, which is very important in building a good relationship. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which will make them more harmonious and more productive as a group, which will also help them in the real world where co-operation is also valued. When children are taught to compete, they will feel anxious and stressed when they are unable to compete and this may lead to depression. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an individualistic mindset that puts individual success before others. Cooperation will make children grow into more selfless, empathetic, and productive adults who can build good relationships and be more productive in the future. In short, although competition has its advantages, I think it is better to teach children to cooperate. Teaching children to cooperate is a good way to raise a generation of empathetic, co-operative, and successful individuals.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.; The ability to compete with others has always been a crucial tool for success, and it is often considered essential for children to learn from a young age. While others argue that children need to be taught to compete in order to be successful later in life, I believe that learning to cooperate is more useful in preparing them to be good citizens. Cooperation teaches children to respect and value each other, and it also gives them a head start in the real world, where teamwork and cooperation are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety and self-esteem problems when children fail. On the other hand, competition can lead to an egocentric attitude where the success of one individual is valued above the success of others. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to work together, share ideas and support each other, so that when they reach adulthood they can build strong relationships, work together in teams and play a positive role in their community. In conclusion, although competition can be beneficial for children, I believe that it is more useful to teach them to cooperate. Cooperation is an essential life skill that can create compassionate, successful and successful adults.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.; Help with an essay: Whether to teach children to compete or to coexist has been a subject of debate for many years. Some argue that teaching children to compete is the most important thing for their future success. I strongly believe that teaching children to coexist is the most useful for them to become useful adults. To coexist is to establish a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary to establish a good and lasting relationship. When children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's abilities and limitations, and the result is a more harmonious and productive team. Competition in the classroom can create a cutthroat environment where students feel under pressure to achieve results, which can cause them to lose self-esteem. And teaching children to compete can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, leading to stress, anxiety and self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. Teaching children to coexist, share and support each other, they will become more mature, empathetic and helpful adults. When they face the complexity of the real world, they will be able to form a solid friendship and contribute to their community. In summary, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to coexist is ultimately more beneficial. To teach children to coexist is the key to raising a compassionate, benevolent and successful generation.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.; To compete or to cooperate is a question that has caused many educators and parents to ponder. Some believe that competition is essential for the future success of children, others that cooperation is more useful for them as useful adults. Cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect which makes it possible to build strong and lasting friendships. Children who work together learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses and to work more effectively as a team, which makes them better prepared for the workplace, where such teamwork is so important. Cooperation is also more satisfying than competition, because competition often produces an unhealthy obsession with winning and a lack of self-esteem and self-confidence if a child does not win. Cooperation develops children into more rounded, empathetic and productive adults who are better prepared to deal with the complexities of the real world. In conclusion, while there are some benefits to encouraging children to compete, in the long run it is better to teach them to cooperate. Children need to be taught to cooperate in order to raise a compassionate, co-operative and successful generation.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.; Learners can be taught to compete or work together. The debate between educators and parents about whether to teach children to compete or work together is a lively one. I think teaching children to work together develops in them the necessary skills such as communication, understanding, empathy and problem-solving. In addition, working together builds community and mutual respect, which is essential for long-term relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this harmony and productivity help them be better prepared for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. When children compete, they may lose their respect for others, and when they meet failures, they may lose their self-esteem. Children who compete are often highly individualistic, and their focus on their own success is unhealthy and can lead to a lack of self-esteem. Working together can build self-esteem and develop into more rounded, empathetic, productive adults. When they enter the real world, they will have more effective skills to build strong relationships, work in teams and build community. Although teaching children to compete has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. For the next generation to be compassionate, compassionate and successful, children must be taught to work together.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.; Teaching children to cooperate develops essential social skills, such as communication, compromise, and problem-solving. The question of whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has aroused much discussion among parents and educators. Cooperation fosters the feeling of community and respect for others that are essential to building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they can recognize and appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a more productive and cohesive group. In the real world, where teamwork is valued highly, cooperation and communication skills can help children to be successful. In addition, competition can create a cutthroat atmosphere that fosters a culture of winning at any cost and erodes the concept of fair play. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can foster an unhealthy focus on personal success and lead to a loss of self-esteem when faced with failure. Cooperation helps children to learn how to share, to listen to others, and to communicate. By learning to work together and to respect the ideas and opinions of others, children can grow into more empathetic and productive adults. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will serve them better in the long run. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative, and successful people.
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.; Dancing is one of the most popular dances in the world, and it has a very important role in society. This is a matter of great controversy in the academic world and among parents. Some educators and parents believe that children should be taught to compete, but I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful to them. Teaching children to cooperate helps them develop the necessary skills to be a useful member of society. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect that helps children build long-term relationships. When children work together, they understand the value of teamwork and work well together. Moreover, cooperation also develops team spirit. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to unhealthy individualism and the pursuit of personal success, which leads to stress and anxiety when they are not successful. Moreover, competition can lead to the feeling of guilt when a child loses, and competition can also cause low self-esteem. Children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, and when they enter the world, they will be able to work together effectively and be useful members of society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think it is more useful to teach children to work together. Children who are taught to work together are more likely to be compassionate, supportive and successful in the long run.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.; Let's do this. This debate has been an important issue for educators and parents for a long time. Some argue that competition is the best way for children to become adults. I believe that cooperation is the best way for children to become useful adults. Cooperation also develops the sense of community and mutual respect that is necessary to establish long-term relationships. If children work together to achieve a common goal, they will learn to appreciate each other's abilities and weaknesses, and will be able to work well together. Then they will be prepared for the world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, if competition is overly emphasized, the child will feel the pressure to succeed, which will destroy the spirit of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition teaches children to be selfish and to focus on their own success, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, resulting in anxiety and low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation makes children more mature, more empathetic, more mature and more productive adults, able to negotiate the complexities of the world, and able to establish long-term relationships and work effectively as a team. In short, although competition also has its benefits, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate. The generation of people who learn to cooperate will eventually become empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.; Those who want to raise children to be more competitive argue that it is necessary for future success. However, I firmly believe that raising children to be more cooperative will benefit their development as useful citizens. Besides, co-operation builds trust, which is important for long-term and lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they can see their respective advantages and disadvantages, which, in turn, will lead to a more harmonious and more productive group. Then, in the real world, when people have to work together in a group, it will be easier for them to get along and achieve the goals set for them. In addition, too much competition can lead to unhealthy rivalry, where children are forced to win at any cost, which is detrimental to fair play and sportsmanship. Teaching children to compete leads to an individualistic attitude in which the achievement of individual success is of utmost importance and then, when the children have failed, it leads to stress, depression and self-esteem. By learning to work together, to support each other and to share, children can develop into a more rounded, empathetic and productive adult. Then, as they enter the complex world of work, they can build strong relationships and work more productively as a group. In conclusion, while competition does have its benefits, I firmly believe that it is better to teach children to be more cooperative. In my opinion, teaching children to be more cooperative is the best way to raise a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.; Write at least 225 words. Assemble your materials and the essay in your pens. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has created a great deal of discussion among educators and parents. I believe that teaching children to cooperate is a better way to teach them to be useful as adults. Cooperation between children creates a strong sense of community and mutual respect, which is the foundation for a long-lasting relationship. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a good group. Then, in the future, they can work together in a team, which is very important in the real world. In addition, competition between children may lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, which can lead to a decrease in self-esteem, depression and anxiety when they encounter obstacles. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they are more likely to be selfish and have a very high self-esteem, which is very useful in their future careers. Cooperation between children builds a strong, healthy and empathetic adult. In the future, when they are faced with the difficulties of life, they can establish long-term relationships, cooperate with others and contribute to the development of the country. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that cooperation is better in the long run. Cooperation is essential to raising a generation of people with good human feelings, good collaboration, and success.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.; You can argue that the most important thing in childhood is to teach children to compete, and others argue that children should learn to cooperate. I strongly disagree, and believe that the more cooperative skills a child develops, the more useful he will be in the future. Cooperation teaches a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important for building a solid and strong relationship between people. Moreover, a sense of community and mutual respect is useful in the real world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. A high degree of competition also creates an environment in which children feel forced to win at all costs, and thus violates the rules of fair play and sportsmanship. Competition, on the other hand, can lead children to become too self-absorbed, so that they may become obsessed with their own success, and if they fail, their self-esteem will suffer, and they will be anxious and depressed. Cooperation teaches children to share, support and help each other, and in the future they will become more empathetic, more responsible and more useful adults who are able to navigate the complexities of the real world, build relationships and work in teams to achieve the common goal. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, it is more beneficial to teach children to cooperate. It is the main thing to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.; Opposing opinions have always existed about teaching children to compete or to cooperate. Those who advocate teaching children to compete claim it will make them more successful in life, while those who advocate teaching children to cooperate believe it will make them more useful as adults. Cooperation teaches children to respect each other and to build strong relationships, and that is very important in the world, where collaboration and teamwork are very important. Cooperation also makes children more patient and responsible, and that is also important. Cooperation can also make children less egocentric, and it is less harmful for them to focus on their success, because if they lose, they will lose their self-confidence. Teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which will lead to them being very disappointed, depressed, and irritable. Cooperation can also make children more balanced, empathetic, and productive adults, so that they can live better in the world, where they will be able to build strong relationships and collaborate more effectively. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, in the long run, it is better to teach children to cooperate. Cooperation is the foundation for a compassionate, collaborating, and successful generation.
281;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples in your answer. ;Nowadays, we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated. Everything seem to be rush, and it have a lot of competition. These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable. And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.; It is a heated debate in schools and families as to whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. While some argue that the ability to compete is important for the future, I am convinced that the ability to work together will help children become better adults. Cooperation is a way to establish a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for strong, long-lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they will better understand each other's talents and weaknesses, which will make them a better team and help them prepare for the outside world where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. In addition, too much emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment where the desire to win takes precedence over fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with personal success and success at the expense of others, which will lead to anxiety and stress when they encounter setbacks. When children are taught to work together, share their ideas and support each other, they will grow into more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, who will be able to build strong relationships and achieve their goals through effective teamwork. In short, while competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to work together will be more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation will help children grow into compassionate, empathetic, and successful adults.
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.; Competition and cooperation have been a subject of heated debate among educators and parents. Some educators and parents argue that competition is essential for children to succeed in the future. I firmly believe that cooperation is more useful for children to become adults. Cooperation creates a strong bond between students and between teachers and students, and cooperation can be extended to the society as a whole. Children will know their strengths and weaknesses by working together for a common goal, and they will also be able to work together more efficiently and produce better results, which will prepare them for the outside world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, competition creates a more cutthroat and intense environment for children to achieve their goals at any cost, thereby reducing the value of fair play and sportsmanship. In contrast, competition can lead children to think that success is an individual matter and that success should be achieved at any cost, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing stress and anxiety and low self-esteem. Cooperation will create more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who will be able to navigate the complexities of the real world, build strong relationships, and work in a team. In conclusion, while there are some benefits of competition, I believe that cooperation has a longer-term value. Cooperation is the foundation of a more compassionate, successful, and productive society.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.; The argument of whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has sparked fierce debate among educators and parents. Some people say that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success. I am convinced that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in making them good and useful people. Cooperation creates the environment in which children can develop their friendship and solidarity, which can then be carried over into the adult world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also gives children a greater appreciation of their peers' talents and limitations, which makes for a more harmonious and productive group. Besides, too much emphasis on competition creates an atmosphere of unhealthy pressure to succeed, which undermines the value of fair play and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete teaches them to have a very individualistic point of view, where their success is more important than the success of others, and it can cause a person to lose their self-esteem and self-confidence when they fail. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share their ideas and support one another, which makes them better equipped to deal with the complexities of the real world, enabling them to build solid relationships, work in teams and contribute to the common good. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. In a word, I would say that teaching children to cooperate is necessary in order to bring up a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.; Cooperation is better than competition. Cooperation is a lesson that children need to learn, a lesson that helps them develop their social skills. This debate has caused fierce debate among parents and teachers. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for building a strong, long-term relationship. When children cooperate, they will understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, and thus make a better team, and the future will be able to cope with the problems of the society in which we live, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Cooperation and competition can also be a vicious circle. Competition puts a lot of pressure on children to succeed at all costs and undermining the importance of fair play and the right to victory. This can lead to unhealthy obsession with success and self-esteem and anxiety, when you lose. Cooperation teaches children to share and support each other, and as they mature, they become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, able to build strong relationships, work in a team and contribute positively to society. Cooperation has its advantages, but it's better for children in the long run to teach them to work together. Cooperation is the basis for a caring, efficient and successful society.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.; Helpful skills like communication, listening, empathy, and solving problems can be developed through cooperation. I have read a lot about the controversial subject of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Some people argue that children should be taught to compete, because this is the way to success in the future. Cooperation, on the other hand, develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is an important part of building strong and lasting relationships. Moreover, when children work together, they learn to respect each other’s weaknesses and strengths, which in turn will help them to build harmonious relationships later on in life. Cooperation also builds a sense of fairness, because children learn that if they want to achieve success, they have to try their best and it is okay to lose. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they will become more individualistic, they will become overly concerned with winning, and they will experience a sense of stress, anxiety, and low self-esteem when they lose. Children who are taught to work together, share ideas, and support each other will grow into well-rounded, compassionate, and successful adults. I conclude that although competition has its benefits, it is more beneficial in the long run to teach children to cooperate. In my opinion, the most important thing is to teach children to cooperate, because this will lead to compassionate, caring, and successful people.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.; It is a hotly debated question whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate. Although there are some who argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is the best way to develop them into useful adults. Cooperation teaches mutual respect, which is essential for the establishment of good relationships. When children work together, they learn to respect each other's capabilities and thus become a better team, which is important in the real world, where teamwork is paramount. Besides, a school environment where competition is encouraged creates a ruthless atmosphere, in which students are encouraged to achieve at any cost. This can lead to a disproportionate interest in the winner's success, and stress and anxiety, when students are not successful. Cooperation creates a more rounded, more empathetic, and more productive adult. This will help them to cope with the complexities of the real world, and help them to build strong relationships, work together effectively, and benefit the society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think it is more beneficial for children to learn to cooperate. It will help them to become compassionate, supportive and successful adults.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.; In the education of children, it is often debated whether it is better to teach them to compete or to cooperate. Although some argue that children need to be taught to compete for future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for the future. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect that are critical to building strong and long-lasting relationships. When children cooperate, they understand each other’s weaknesses and strengths, which makes them a more harmonious and productive group. It also prepares them for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are valued highly. Cooperation also helps children develop a sense of fairness and fair play. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may become too individualistic and focus too much on their own success, which can lead to a lack of confidence and self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. Cooperation develops a sense of equality and shared responsibility among children, and these children will grow into more empathetic and responsible adults who are better able to manage the complexities of the real world. In conclusion, although competition has some benefits, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is critical to a healthy and successful future.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.; When teaching children to compete or cooperate, some educators and parents believe that competition is more useful for children in the future, while others believe that cooperation is more beneficial for the children. Children who are taught to cooperate are taught to have a good understanding of communication, empathy, problem solving and other important social skills. Cooperation also teaches children to appreciate each other's abilities, so they can get along with others well and work well. And it is good preparation for their future work, where teamwork is highly valued. The children who are taught to compete are often obsessed with winning and focusing on their own success. When they are unsuccessful, they will be very anxious and feel low. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas and support each other, and to learn to be well-rounded, empathetic and hard-working adults. They will be able to adapt to the complexity of the real world, and build a strong foundation for themselves and others. Cooperation is the key to a new generation of compassionate, successful people.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.; Why do children learn more by playing together than by competing with each other? The discussion on whether children should learn to compete or work together is still a controversial issue among educators and parents. Generally speaking, children who play together are more likely to be less likely to quarrel and more likely to get along with each other. In addition, working together also teaches children how to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which leads to a more cohesive and productive group, preparing them for a world where teamwork is an essential skill. However, children who are forced to compete will be more inclined to put personal interests first and become more self-reliant, and may even become obsessed with winning, leading to self-esteem problems when they face failure. Eventually, children who work together become more mature and responsible people. When they grow up, they are more likely to build strong friendships and be able to work with their peers more easily, so they can positively contribute to their communities. In short, while both work and competition are useful for children, I personally think that if children learn to work together from an early age, they will be more productive in the long run. . It is a long-term goal of cultivating a generation of people who are able to get along with each other, help each other and work together to do better in the world.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.; I think that it is more useful to teach children to cooperate than to compete. Some people argue that teaching children to compete helps them to become more successful in life. However, I believe that children who learn to cooperate can be better people. In addition, cooperation can help children develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for long-term relationships. It also helps them to prepare for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, a focus on competition can create a harsh environment in which children are expected to win at all costs, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and a decrease in self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. Cooperation teaches children to help each other, share their ideas, and support each other. As they grow up, they will be better able to build strong relationships, work in teams, and positively contribute to society. In conclusion, although competition is sometimes necessary, I believe that teaching children to cooperate can be more useful in the long run. Cooperation is necessary to raise a compassionate, cooperative, and successful generation.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.; The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has raised much discussion among educators and parents. Some believe that competition is essential for children's future success, while others believe that teaching them to co-operate is more beneficial in preparing them for adulthood. Cooperation is not only advantageous for their future in the business world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued, but also to build a strong sense of community and mutual respect in the world. Moreover, a strong emphasis on competition creates an atmosphere of extreme competition, where children are expected to win at all costs, thus reducing the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, which leads to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when failures occur. If children learn to co-operate, share ideas, and support each other, they will be more capable of navigating the complexity of the world and building strong relationships. In short, while competition does have its benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. Ultimately, teaching children to co-operate is the most effective way to build a compassionate, collaborative, and successful society.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.; In my opinion, children should be taught to compete rather than to work together, because it gives them the opportunity to develop the most important social skills, such as communication, participation, empathy and problem-solving. It has long been a matter of debate among educators and parents that teaching children to compete or to cooperate is necessary for their future success. Cooperation gives children a sense of unity and respect, which are essential to building strong relationships. Cooperation prepares children for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, the excessive emphasis on competition may lead to unhealthy rivalry, in which children try to achieve success at all costs, and a lack of fairness and self-esteem when they are defeated. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy sense of individualism, where children are encouraged to focus on their own success rather than the success of others. The desire to succeed can lead to stress, anxiety and poor self-esteem when they fail. Children learn to share ideas and support each other, which makes them more empathetic, more capable of working with others, and more able to contribute to their community. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some advantages, in the long run, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial for children. Cooperation is necessary to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.; If you can, try to find out what this essay was about. The question of whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has aroused great controversy among teachers and parents. Some argue that children must be taught to compete in order to achieve success in life. I believe, however, that children should be taught to cooperate, because they can learn important social skills like communication, empathy and problem-solving. Cooperation also builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for forming good relationships in the future. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to recognize the weaknesses and strengths of each other, resulting in a more productive and cohesive group. Besides, when children are taught to compete they are likely to lose sight of the value of fair play and, as a result, they will suffer from stress, anxiety and a loss of self-esteem. Teaching children to compete teaches them to think selfishly and to concentrate on their own success. This can result in a highly individualistic attitude, a ruthless determination to win at all costs and a lack of appreciation for the achievements of others. Cooperation develops the whole child and makes them better equipped to deal with the complexities of the real world. It will help them to build strong relationships, work well in a team and be a credit to their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will bring more benefits in the long run. Cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of compassionate, caring and successful adults.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.; Why? I think children learn better by themselves, because they develop more social skills. I think that if we teach children to cooperate, we develop essential social skills, such as communication, understanding, and solving problems. The question of whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate is an issue that has long been debated by educators and parents. Cooperation is a skill that is particularly useful in the real world, where it is important to be a team player. Children can recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each other when they work together. Competition can create a cutthroat environment where children are under pressure to win at all costs. Then they will lose respect for fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic mind, where success is seen as a personal achievement, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and lack of self-esteem when children fail. In the end, if we teach children to cooperate, they will grow up to be more cooperative, friendly, and more mature people. They will be able to build strong relationships, work well in teams, and be more productive in society. Cooperation is a life skill that helps children become more mature and sociable people.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.; Some argue that it is necessary to teach children to compete in order to be able to get along with them in the future. I think it is much better to teach them to cooperate, so that they will learn such social skills as communication, understanding, patience, and solving problems. And most importantly, cooperation teaches children to be united and respectful, which is very important for establishing strong and lasting relationships. And if the children cooperate in the classroom, they will also be able to work together in the future, because the team will be more successful and harmonious, which will help them in the real world. A competitive environment will be formed, where the child is under great pressure to succeed, and sportsmanship and fairness are lost. On the contrary, when children are taught to compete, they will be prone to excessive individualism, they will place a very high value on their own success, and when they fail, they will be very worried, and their self-esteem will fall. Cooperation will help children become more well-rounded, empathetic, and capable adults. Cooperation will help them to navigate the complexities of the real world, so that they can establish and maintain good relationships, and play a role in a community. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I think teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is essential for the success of the future, so it is necessary to teach children to cooperate.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons."; The first thing that comes to mind when I think about children learning to compete is that it will give them the skills they need to compete. While there is a tendency to believe that competition will make them better in the future, I strongly believe that teaching children to work together will be more beneficial for them in the long run. Firstly, it can create a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to build strong and long-lasting relationships. Secondly, when children work together towards a common goal, they can learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others, which leads to a more harmonious and productive team. Thirdly, excessive emphasis on competition can result in a cutthroat atmosphere, in which children are under constant pressure to succeed at any cost, which can lead to self-esteem issues when they are confronted with failure. On the other hand, teaching children to compete will make them more egoistic, which means they will place more emphasis on their own success and achievement than others, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they encounter failure. Fourthly, by encouraging children to work together, share ideas and support each other, they can become more empathetic and productive people as they grow up and are better able to build strong relationships and contribute positively to society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. Essentially, by encouraging children to work together, we can build a society of compassionate, collaborative and successful people.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";" The discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has aroused great interest among both educators and parents. While some believe that the development of a competitive spirit in children is the basis for their future success, I think that the development of a cooperative spirit is more beneficial in terms of their adult development. Cooperation develops in children the sense of community and mutual respect that are necessary for the establishment of lasting and mutually beneficial relationships. Children who work together on a common goal learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues, and this, in turn, prepares them for the outside world, where a sense of community and respect for others is highly appreciated. Furthermore, a child who is taught to compete often creates a situation in which he is under pressure to win at all costs, which can lead to the emergence of a so-called ""tiger spirit"" and a loss of fair play and sportsmanship. In contrast, teaching children to compete creates a very individualistic spirit, a desire for personal success at the expense of the success of others, and stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem when there are failures. Cooperation develops children into adults who are empathetic, well-adjusted and capable of developing strong relationships with others and, as a result, have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, although competition is beneficial, I think that cooperation is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation, therefore, should be the basis for raising the next generation of empathetic, well-adjusted and successful people."
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.; Learn the corresponding punctuation and sentence structure. We debated among teachers and parents, whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Cooperation and competition both have their advantages. Cooperation helps children learn to respect and appreciate each other, which is useful in later life when the need for collaboration and teamwork are very high. Competition, on the other hand, creates a sense of competition and fair play in children, which is useful when they encounter the difficult situation of not being able to compete with the world. Children who are too individualistic, on the other hand, put themselves before others, which causes anxiety, stress and a decrease in self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation and competition, I think, can both have their place in children's education, but the long-term benefits of teaching children to cooperate are more important. Then they can learn to live in a better relationship, to build more teams, and to benefit more from the work of the community. Cooperation is essential for the education of a generation of successful, caring and successful people.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been the subject of debate among teachers and parents for many years. While some people argue that competition is essential to the children’s future success, I believe that a cooperative approach can help them to become useful adults. Cooperation among children helps to build up the respect for each other that is essential for establishing strong, long-lasting relationships. It also prepares children for the adult world, where the teamwork is often emphasized. Besides, the environment that encourages competition can also lead to unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety and a lack of self-esteem. On the other hand, competition can encourage children to be too selfish and focused on their own success, which can result in the unhealthy obsession with winning and result in an unhealthy obsession with winning. Children who learn to share ideas and help each other develop into more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. Hence, while competition has its advantages, I believe that in the long run, teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial for them. I think that in a well-developed country like ours, the children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life."; This debate between parents and teachers about teaching children to compete or to cooperate has long been debated, but I am of the opinion that if children are taught to cooperate rather than compete, they will become better adults. Cooperation is also good for building strong and lasting relationships. Children can learn to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses. Then they can appreciate each other more. The danger of competition is that children feel under pressure to succeed, and they do not realize the value of fairness and good sportsmanship. If they do not win, they are likely to become anxious and lose self-esteem. Cooperation is also good for helping children learn to share ideas, help each other, and learn to appreciate each other. As adults, they will be able to form stronger relationships and work more effectively in a group. In short, although competition is also useful for children, it is more useful for children to learn to cooperate. It is the only way to raise a successful and united generation.
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.; When it comes to teaching children to compete or to cooperate, many people think the competition is essential for their future success. I think it is more useful to teach children to cooperate because they learn many useful social skills such as communication, empathy, and problem solving. Moreover, cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong and lasting relationships. Children who cooperate with each other learn to respect the strengths and weaknesses of others and become more productive and successful. Competition can lead to unhealthy individualism, which can lead to a lack of confidence and stress, which can result in frustration. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to the development of a self-centred and unhealthy emphasis on personal success, which can lead to unhealthy competition, stress, and anxiety when they encounter a setback. As a result, they are less able to build a team and become less able to contribute to the community. In conclusion, although I agree that there are many benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate has more advantages in the long run. Cooperation is the key to building a generation of compassionate, cooperative, and successful people.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.; This task is for those who would argue that children should be taught to compete, while others argue that teaching children to coexist is more important. While some people believe that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I strongly believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. Coexisting teaches a sense of community and mutual respect, which are both essential to forming strong, long-lasting relationships. Besides, when children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to respect each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which helps to create a more cohesive and productive team. Similarly, the ability to work with others enables children to be more successful in the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. As a matter of fact, a heavy emphasis on competition can foster an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause children to lose self-esteem and become cynical when they fail. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to a tendency to overestimate the value of their own success, which can lead to stress and anxiety, as well as a reduced self-esteem, when they encounter failure. When children learn to share ideas and support each other, they develop into more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who are more capable of navigating the complexities of the real world. In conclusion, while competition is important, I believe that teaching children to coexist is ultimately more beneficial. In short, teaching children to coexist is essential to raising a compassionate, cooperative, and successful generation.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.; ... In the meantime, the debate has begun about whether to teach children to compete or to cooperate. Some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success. However, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future growth. Cooperative learning builds a community of mutual trust and respect, which is very important for building strong, lasting relationships. Cooperation teaches children to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses and to create a more productive and cohesive team, and in this way it prepares them for a team and for the future, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can make children too obsessed with winning, causing them to lose self-esteem, become anxious and nervous, and then become obsessed with competition. In contrast, cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas, and support each other, and thus develop into more mature, responsible, and cooperative adults, who are better prepared to work in a team and to work in a group and make a positive contribution to the community. Although both competition and cooperation have their advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for their future. In conclusion, it is necessary to teach children to cooperate to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.; People often debate whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate. Although some believe that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate has more positive results on their development as useful adults. In addition, the cooperative method also encourages the feeling of community and mutual respect that is essential for building long-lasting relationships. When children work together toward a common goal, they learn to respect each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which makes for a harmonious and productive group. In the real world, where teamwork is highly valued, they will be more prepared for the future. If children are taught to compete, they may develop unhealthy attitudes toward success and they may be subject to the stress of failing, which may reduce their self-esteem. Besides, an unhealthy focus on success leads to obsession with winning, which is dangerous because it causes anxiety, and when they fail they feel discouraged. With the cooperative method, children learn to share ideas and help each other, which makes them better able to handle the complexities of the real world, where they will be able to build relationships and work as a team. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think that in the long run, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for them. It is also the most effective way to help them grow up to be successful and useful members of society.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.; This is because children who are taught to work together have a greater opportunity to develop their social skills, such as communication, understanding and the ability to solve problems. Whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has long been a controversial topic for both parents and teachers. Cooperation, on the one hand, is beneficial for children to learn to share and share, and on the other hand, it is conducive to building a harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship. Moreover, children working together can learn to respect each other's differences, and they will learn to work together in the future. Competition, on the contrary, will lead children to become more selfish, so that they can only compete with others to win, which is not conducive to the healthy growth of children's hearts. In addition, teaching children to compete may lead to the emergence of selfish tendencies, which will make them be too obsessed with winning, which will lead to their children. Having setbacks, they will have low self-esteem and will have a poor attitude towards life. Cooperation is beneficial for children, so that they will become more empathetic, kind and helpful people in the future, and they will be more capable of solving problems together. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its advantages, I still think that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. Children must be taught to work together in order to raise a generation of people who are kind, helpful and successful.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV."; After all, some people believe that teaching children to compete with each other rather than co-operate will make them better people. I disagree. It is my firm belief that children should be taught to work together rather than compete with each other. In the first place, co-operation teaches children a sense of sharing and mutual respect, which is essential to building a solid community. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s abilities and this makes them a more harmonious and productive group, which will be useful in the real world where working as a team is important. Besides, competition creates a cutthroat environment where children feel under pressure to win at any cost. This teaches them a lack of fairness and can lead to a high level of stress and poor self-esteem when they fail. For these reasons, I believe that children should be taught to co-operate rather than compete. In the long run, children who learn to co-operate rather than compete will be more effective, more mature and able to build strong relationships and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, while there are some benefits to encouraging children to compete, in the long run, I believe that encouraging children to co-operate is a more useful and productive way to raise them. It will help to build a generation of compassionate, co-operative and successful individuals.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.; What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? When children are taught to compete with each other or work together, there has been a lot of discussion among educators and parents, because many argue that teaching children to compete is more important for future success, while others believe that children should be taught to work together for their own benefit. Co-operation can build a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for future development. In addition, working together can also make children more willing to learn to appreciate each other's talents and weaknesses, and to a certain extent, they are more suitable for real life. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an egotistical attitude towards life, making them focus on their own success and fail to think about the happiness of others, which can lead to a decline in self-esteem and self-confidence. With a deeper understanding of co-operation, children are better able to make progress and develop their full potential in the face of difficulties in the world. It can be said that it is more conducive to their future development. To raise a generation of people who are kind, co-operative and successful, teaching children to work together is the best policy.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.; Having a discussion about whether or not to teach children to compete or to work together has engendered considerable debate among educators and parents. Some believe that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, but I believe that teaching children to work together is far more useful in helping them to become useful members of society. Moreover, it fosters a sense of community and mutual respect that will be useful in building strong and lasting relationships. Children who work together toward a common goal will learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which will make for a more productive and cohesive team. In addition, a heavy emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat atmosphere that undermines the concept of fair play. By contrast, teaching children to compete leads to a selfish and unhealthy obsession with winning, which may lead to a lower self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. To conclude, although there is value in teaching children to compete, I feel that it is of less value than teaching them to work together, for when they reach adulthood, they will be more capable of handling the complex challenges of life. They will also be better equipped to work in a team and to contribute to their community. In my view, teaching children to work together will help them to grow into successful, cooperative members of society.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.; The debate on whether to teach children to compete or coexist has provoked many educators and parents. Although some argue that competition is the most important tool for success in life, others argue that learning to coexist with others is more beneficial in the long run. ... coexistence instills a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important in building relationships that last. In addition, coexistence prepares children for life, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to a very individualistic mindset in which the child values its own success above the success of others. It also creates a stressful environment in which children are forced to succeed at all costs, which leads to a decrease in self-esteem and self-confidence, especially when they encounter failure. From an early age, children who learn to share ideas and support each other will develop into more mature, empathic and productive adults, able to build strong relationships and work together to benefit the community. Although competition has its benefits, I think that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. It is important to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.; If you teach children to compete with each other, they can become better future employees, but others argue that teaching children to work together is the best way to help them become useful adults. The debate between children competing or working together has led to a great deal of debate among teachers and parents. In the end, I think children who work together are more likely to respect each other and build a community of life, which is useful for children to prepare for future careers. In addition, too much competition can lead to a cutthroat environment where children are under tremendous pressure to win at all costs, which is against the idea of fair competition and the spirit of sportsmanship. But teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, causing them to lose their self-confidence and not be able to face setbacks. Children who work together, share ideas, and support each other are better able to navigate the complex world and form strong relationships, so they can work together effectively and benefit their communities. In conclusion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I still think it is more beneficial to teach children to work together. It is the best way to educate children and help them become successful people.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.; Writing task 2: The debate about whether to teach children to compete or to coexist has always been a hot issue between parents and teachers. While some argue that competition is essential for future success, others firmly believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial for their future success. There are many advantages of teaching children to coexist. First, it develops team spirit and mutual respect, which are important for establishing good and long-lasting relationships. Secondly, children learn to work together to achieve common goals, so they can see their strengths and weaknesses. This makes them more productive and creates harmony and team spirit. The idea of competition, on the other hand, teaches children to be egoistic and to always win at all costs, causing them to be very anxious and to lose self-esteem when they lose. From a young age, learning to share ideas and support each other is a good lesson for children. When they grow up and enter the world of business and other complex circumstances, they will be able to better cope with these problems and better understand the value of coexistence and coexistence. In my opinion, despite the advantages of teaching children to compete, teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. Coexisting children are better able to form a successful and harmonious society than competing children.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.; Discuss both points of view and explain why you agree or disagree. The question of whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate has long been debated among parents and educators. Some argue that competition is the only way to success in the future, but I believe that the ability to cooperate is a more important and valuable trait in future adults. Cooperation teaches mutual respect and admiration for one another, which is a necessary foundation for building lasting relationships. Children who work together toward a common goal learn to appreciate the differences in one another, and this helps them to achieve a more harmonious and productive team. This prepares them for the world where collaboration and teamwork are increasingly valued. Furthermore, teaching children to compete can result in unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and lower self-esteem when faced with setbacks. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to share ideas, support one another, and encourages their personal growth, which will enable them to form more lasting relationships, work better in a team and better serve the needs of the community. In my opinion, cooperation is the better long-term solution. It will help raise the next generation of more compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.; In your essay you should argue your opinion in a way that is easy to understand. There is a lot of debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Cooperation helps children to build a sense of community and mutual respect, which is very important for establishing long-lasting relationships. If children work together for a common goal, they learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, and the result is a more harmonious and productive group. This is also very useful in the adult world, where collaboration and teamwork are valued. It is also possible that competition can lead to unhealthy stress and an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can cause anxiety and lack of self-esteem in children who have setbacks. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy individualism that tries to put success above others. Cooperation, on the other hand, can help children develop a broader understanding of the world and lead to more positive attitudes towards others. This will help them as they become adults and face the complexity of their lives. In conclusion, I believe that although competition is beneficial, the more long-term benefit of teaching children to cooperate is greater. I think that teaching children to cooperate is essential to raise a generation of people who care about others and can work well with others.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.; Talk about whether teaching children to compete or coexist is more useful. The debate about whether to teach children to compete or coexist has long been debated among parents and teachers. Cooperation is better than competition because it makes children work together and appreciate each other’s talents and weaknesses, which in turn makes them more efficient as a team and able to deal with the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, too much emphasis on competition leads to a vicious circle of success and failure where the children lose the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to the individualistic attitude of focusing on personal success rather than on others, which is bound to cause problems such as stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem when they face setbacks. If they learn to work together and support each other, they will be better equipped to face the complexities of the real world and work as a cohesive team, contributing to society. In my opinion, cooperation is more beneficial than competition in the long run. To sum up, teaching children to coexist is more beneficial because it makes them better individuals.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government."; I believe that it is much more important to preserve the old buildings and homes than to build new ones. Do you agree or disagree? One reason for this is that the older the building is, the more valuable it is. Moreover, there is a feeling of community and mutual respect between people who work together. The resulting more harmonious and better-functioning team prepares the child for later life in the community, in which such collaboration and work are very important. A too strong focus on competition leads to an unhealthy focus on one's own success, which leads to stress, anxiety and loss of self-esteem in the face of failure. By enabling children to learn to share and support each other, they will become better able to deal with the real world as adults, enabling them to build relationships, work together and contribute positively to society. To sum up, while there are benefits to competition, it is my belief that teaching children to work together is even more important for the future. I would say that it is in fact very important to create a generation of children who are capable of cooperation, who will be successful and, above all, who will be kind to each other.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.; It is important to discuss the merits of teaching children to compete or cooperate. Although many argue that competition is the way to success for children, I believe that it is more useful to teach them to cooperate. Moreover, children learn to respect each other and have a feeling of community, which is important for building long-term relationships. When children work together, they understand their individual abilities and together they produce a product. It is the same in the future in the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, when a child competes, he feels the pressure to achieve success at all costs, which reduces the value of fairness and sportsmanship. Children who are taught to compete, on the other hand, will be too individualistic, they will put their success ahead of the success of others, and when they are unsuccessful, they will be too anxious, and they will not be able to stand themselves. Children who learn to cooperate, to share ideas, support each other, become more mature, more capable, empathetic and more successful people who are able to build strong relationships, work well in teams and positively affect their environment. To conclude, although competition is also beneficial for children, I think that it is more useful to teach them to cooperate. Children who learn to work together are better able to relate to and value the success of others. Ultimately, the success of a person, a society and a country depends on the ability of its citizens to work together.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational."; Driving a car in busy city streets is not a great experience for many drivers. Some teachers and parents believe that it is better to teach children to compete than to cooperate. But in my opinion, teaching children to cooperate will help them be good citizens. Cooperation can also foster a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important in building strong, lasting relationships. When children cooperate, they can learn to appreciate each other’s talents and weaknesses, and their work will be more productive. This will also help them be better prepared for the world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation can also teach children to be responsible, fair, and tolerant of others. When children are taught to compete, they might become more selfish and compete too much, so they might become anxious and lose their self-esteem if they lose a contest. Cooperation can help children become well-rounded adults who are empathetic, productive, and ready to handle the real world. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is essential to raising a compassionate, empathetic, and successful generation.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job."; Discuss both views and give your own opinion. The debate on whether it is better to teach children to compete or to cooperate has been a source of great debate among educators and parents for many years. Although some people argue that it is better to teach children to compete, as it makes them more successful in the future, I believe that children learn to cooperate is more useful to them. Cooperation is necessary to build relationships and trust, which is very useful for future relationships. Children who work together on a common goal learn to appreciate the differences between them, which creates a more efficient and productive team. In the future, they can work together with a greater sense of trust and mutual respect, which is an excellent training for the real world, where teamwork and collaboration are very important. In addition, too much competition can create a cutthroat environment where the success of the child is paramount, and this can lead to a greater focus on winning, which can cause stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem if the child fails. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they become too individualistic, focusing on their own success rather than the success of others, which in turn can cause stress, anxiety and self-esteem problems if they do not achieve success. Cooperation is necessary to build good relationships with others and this is very useful in the future, as it helps children to build strong relationships with others, and the ability to build relationships and to work together to achieve success in a complex world. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that it is more beneficial for them to learn to cooperate. I believe that it is essential to teach children to cooperate, so that they can grow up to be more compassionate, cooperative and successful people.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone."; I think that the co-operation of children is very useful for their future development. The co-operation of children develops their social skills, communication skills, empathy, and the ability to deal with difficult situations. In addition, it creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is important for the formation of long-term friendships. When children work together for the same goal, they understand the strengths and weaknesses of their peers, which creates a harmonious and productive group, and thus prepares them for a world where teamwork is highly appreciated. Competition, on the other hand, leads to the development of a selfish and unhealthy competition in children, a concern with winning at all costs, and a reduction in the value of sportsmanship and fair play. This is why I think it is very important to teach children to work together. In this way, children develop into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who will be able to cope with the complexity of the world and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, although the competition of children has its advantages, I think it is more useful to teach them to cooperate. If children are taught to work together, they will grow into empathetic, helpful, and successful people.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.; Working for yourself enables you to gain knowledge, experience and skills that may not be available if you were working for an employer. The question of whether children should be taught to compete or work together has long been the subject of heated debates among educators and parents. I believe that children who are taught to work together develop the necessary social skills such as communication, empathy, and problem solving. This in turn prepares them for life in the real world where teamwork and collaboration are essential. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to respect each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which in turn enables them to work more efficiently and effectively. In addition, the environment that fosters competition undermines the values of fair play and sportsmanship. Children who are taught to compete can become very individualistic and may even become too obsessed with winning, which can result in a decline in self-esteem and confidence when they fail. However, children who are taught to work together, to share ideas and to help each other develop into well-rounded, productive, and empathetic adults who are able to effectively navigate the complexities of the real world, and who are able to build strong relationships and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, I would argue that while competition is beneficial in certain respects, the long-term benefits of encouraging children to work together far outweigh the benefits of competition. Teaching children to work together is an essential step towards raising a generation of compassionate, hardworking, and successful individuals.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors."; There is a debate among teachers and parents whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate, and whether teaching children to compete or to cooperate would make them more useful in the future. I am of the opinion that teaching children to cooperate is better. Cooperation gives a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential for building lasting relationships. Besides, children work together to reach the same goal, and they can appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this gives them a sense of teamwork and teamwork in the real world. Cooperation is also more rewarding than competition, so it doesn't require competition to win, and there is no need for the team to play with a child to achieve a goal. If you teach children to compete, they will become too individualistic and selfish, and they will become obsessed with winning, which will make them anxious and anxious, and even if they lose, they will have low self-esteem. Cooperation makes children mature and productive, able to adapt to the complex social environment, and help them build strong relationships, work together, and benefit society. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, in the long run, I think teaching children to cooperate is better. Cooperation is the key to raising a compassionate, united, and successful generation.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.; Children are best taught to cooperate rather than compete, an issue that is now an object of heated debate among teachers and parents. Some argue that teaching children to compete helps them achieve success in later life, but I think that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in making them useful adults. Cooperation fosters the development of strong ties, both personal and professional, which in turn prepares children for the real world, where working in a team is important. Cooperation also creates an atmosphere of trust, while competition can lead to an environment where children feel under pressure to succeed at all costs, and therefore lose the value of fair play and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, a tendency to compete can make children overly individualistic and less tolerant of others’ failures. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas and help each other. Such children will be more empathetic, more productive adults, able to forge strong relationships and contribute more effectively to society. In conclusion, while competition has its advantages, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. In the final analysis, cooperation is the best way to raise a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful adults.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life."; I believe that children should be taught to work together rather than to compete. While some educators and parents believe that children need to learn to compete for their future success, I think that children need to be taught to work together to make them useful adults. Co-operation also fosters a sense of community and mutual respect that is important in building a long-lasting relationship. By working together, children can learn each other's strengths and weaknesses, which leads to a harmonious and more productive team. A child who is taught to compete is more likely to have an unhealthy desire to win and therefore has a tendency to lose confidence in himself when he loses and is therefore inclined to become anxious and depressed. Children who are taught to work together, to share ideas, to be supportive, will grow into adults who can better deal with the complexity of the world, build strong relationships, work together and play an important role in their communities. To sum up, I think that although competition has some advantages, co-operation is better in the long run. In the end, teaching children to work together is a way to create a more compassionate, better and more successful society.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.; Discuss both sides and justify your opinion. The question of whether it is better to teach children to compete or to cooperate has long been discussed among educators and parents. Some argue that teaching children to compete is a necessity for their future success, while others believe that teaching children to cooperate is a more useful way to prepare them for life. Cooperation teaches children to appreciate each other’s abilities and strengths, which makes them a more harmonious and productive team. This prepares them for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. But when children are taught to compete they are under enormous pressure to achieve, often resulting in unhealthy obsession with winning, causing depression, stress and anxiety when they fail. Cooperation is more conducive to creativity and innovation, and helps children develop into better adults, more capable of sharing ideas and making a contribution to society. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete may have some benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is essential to raising a compassionate, successful and productive society.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.; The education of children is important to develop their ability to compete with each other or to work together, argues the debate between parents and educators. There are people who think that learning to compete is essential for future success. I believe that teaching children to work together is more important for the development of their social skills, such as the ability to communicate, listen, empathize and solve problems. And the development of a sense of community and mutual respect, which are important for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes the team more cohesive and productive. This prepares them for the real world, where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. To compete with each other, however, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, stress and self-esteem when children face failure. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete with each other, they tend to become overly individualistic and egotistical. If children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, they will develop into more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults. As they go out into the complex world, they will be better equipped to build strong relationships, work effectively in teams and contribute to the welfare of their communities. In conclusion, although competition is important, I think that the benefits of teaching children to work together are more long-term. If children learn to work together, they will be more empathetic, cooperative and successful.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.; I strongly disagree with this statement. The debate between if children should be taught to compete or cooperate has aroused great debate amongst teachers and parents. While many educators and parents argue that children should be taught to compete, I would argue that teaching children to cooperate will make them better citizens in the future. In addition, the cooperative environment helps develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which are critical for establishing strong relationships. Moreover, children who learn to work together learn to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, which in turn makes them better workers in the future, where collaboration and teamwork are valued. A competitive environment can also lead to unhealthy stress and lack of self-esteem when children are unsuccessful, and can lead to increased competition between children. Finally, children who are forced to compete have an unhealthy obsession with winning, which is a source of anxiety and low self-esteem when they face defeat. Children who learn to work together, share ideas, and support each other are better prepared to deal with the complexity of the real world, where they can establish strong relationships, work together effectively, and positively affect the community. In summary, although teaching children to compete has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will have a more positive impact in the long run. Children who are taught to cooperate are more compassionate, more successful, and more capable.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.; With all the opinions that competition or co-operation can help children in the future, the question is: how to teach children to compete or cooperate. Cooperation creates a feeling of community and mutual respect, which is an important foundation for building strong, long-term relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they will be able to understand each other’s abilities and skills, and they will work more efficiently as a team, which in turn will help them in their future work, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to a selfish attitude in which the child puts its own success above others. When it comes to the competition itself, it can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to a decrease in self-esteem, stress and depression in children who fail. In my opinion, when children learn to share ideas and support each other, they become more compassionate, more productive, and better able to work with others, and in the future they will be better able to establish relationships and work in teams. In conclusion, I think it is more useful to teach children to cooperate than to compete. It is also important to raise a generation of people who can work together and have a good relationship.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life."; As many parents and educators have long argued, there is a heated debate over whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. The idea that competition is the best path to future success has been widely accepted, while I argue that children should be taught to work together in order to grow into useful and competent adults. Moreover, co-operation builds community and mutual respect, which is necessary to build strong, lasting relationships. In addition, children working together toward a common goal will appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a more cohesive and productive team. This will help prepare children for the world in which collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, competition may lead to unhealthy competition between the children themselves, which can lead to stress and anxiety and result in low self-esteem when they fail. On the other hand, teaching children to compete could lead to an unhealthy focus on individual success, causing them to suffer from stress and low self-esteem when they encounter obstacles. Children who learn to share ideas and support each other will become more well-rounded, helpful and productive adults. Teaching children to work together will help them to be more confident and competent in dealing with the complexity of the real world. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete has its advantages, I believe that teaching them to work together has more advantages in the long run. In a nutshell, I believe that teaching children to work together is essential in raising a generation of helpful, co-operative and successful people.
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live."; The most important reason for teaching children to co-operate is that it helps them to develop important social skills such as communication, consideration, empathy and the ability to solve problems. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has been a subject of great debate among parents and teachers. In my view, it is better to teach children to co-operate, because it teaches them to get along together and to respect each other, and in so doing, it helps them to be better prepared for the real world where co-operation and teamwork are highly valued. Besides, competition can create an unhealthy emphasis on personal achievement, and undermining fair play and good sportsmanship. It is better to teach children to co-operate because it may lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which could be very damaging to their self-esteem if they ever fail. It is better to teach children to co-operate because it enables them to be more caring and productive as adults, with a better understanding of the problems and difficulties of others. In conclusion, I think that although teaching children to compete has many benefits, it is better to teach them to co-operate, because it is better in the long run. It enables them to grow into compassionate, tolerant, productive, and successful adults.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;   A lot of competition between people and schools can make children impatient and overly critical of others, which can lead to stress, low self-esteem and frustration. On the other hand, a tendency to compete can lead to an individualistic attitude, where children and adults place their own success before the success of others, which can lead to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when failure occurs. Cooperation and solidarity among people and schools can produce a more empathetic and productive society, because it trains children to support each other, share ideas and support each other. Cooperation and solidarity are very beneficial for the long term and I think that although there is an advantage in competition for children, in the long run it is more beneficial for them to cooperate and be supportive of each other. Eventually, it is important to teach children to cooperate so that they can grow up to be empathetic, supportive and successful individuals.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.; If you want to, you can add some sentences about your own opinion. Among teachers and parents, the question of whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has caused a great deal of debate. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important for them to become useful people. Cooperation teaches people to respect each other and, as a result, it is easier to build strong, lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and the end result is a more harmonious and productive group. As long as the focus is on competition, it can lead to a cutthroat environment in which the focus is on success at all costs and the rules of fair play and sportsmanship are lost. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may have an unhealthy focus on their own success and may become disappointed and anxious when they encounter difficulties. Cooperation makes children more mature, empathetic and active. When they have to cope with the world's problems, they can do so more effectively as a group, by learning to support each other, sharing ideas and support each other. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is ultimately more beneficial. Cooperation is the foundation of a kind, united and successful society.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.; The debate between teaching children to compete or to cooperate has sparked intense debate among educators and parents. Although some have argued that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I would argue that teaching children to cooperate is the more effective way to make them good people. In my opinion, cooperation is a way of building a sense of community and mutual respect, and that is essential to building strong and lasting relationships. Children can better appreciate each other’s talents and weaknesses, which makes for a more harmonious and productive group and also prepares them for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are valued. It also teaches them fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy individualistic perspective, in which they see their own success as more important than others. When faced with failures and setbacks, they may become anxious and depressed, which can have a detrimental effect on their self-esteem. It can be argued that, if children are taught to cooperate, they will become more caring and productive adults, who will be better able to deal with the complexities of the real world and to establish positive relationships and make a positive contribution to their communities. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete can be beneficial, I think that in the long run, teaching children to cooperate has the greatest long-term benefits. Teaching children to cooperate is the best way to raise a generation of compassionate, productive and successful individuals.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.; As you know, the issue of whether to teach children to compete or to cooperate has been the subject of debate for some time among educators and parents. Some educators and parents are of the view that competition in children is necessary for their future success, while others feel that co-operation is a more useful approach to the problem. A spirit of co-operation and mutual respect is also important for the building of strong and lasting relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to respect one another’s strengths and weaknesses, which can lead to a more harmonious and productive group. Besides, a sense of community and mutual respect is useful in establishing the concept of one’s self in society. A spirit of competition can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a loss of self-esteem when the child fails. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can result in an unhealthy emphasis on individual achievement, leading to an unhealthy obsession with success, resulting in a lack of self-esteem and even depression when they do not succeed. But if children are taught to work together, to share ideas and to support one another, they develop into more well-rounded and empathetic people, who can deal with the complexities of life and the workplace. In my opinion, then, while competition has its advantages, I believe that children are better off when they are taught to cooperate. Teaching children to cooperate is essential for raising a compassionate and successful generation.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.; What are the advantages and disadvantages of using IT in the classroom? The argument of whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has led to heated debates among teachers and parents. I firmly believe that co-operation helps develop important social skills, such as cooperation, understanding, and empathy. It also fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which are important for establishing long-lasting relationships. Besides, if children work together to achieve a common goal, they will be able to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses and thus be better prepared for the outside world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, too much emphasis on competition leads to a cut-throat atmosphere where children are forced to compete at all costs, which could lead to unfair practices and poor sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can make them too individualistic and place too much emphasis on individual achievement, which could lead to a vicious cycle of self-pity, stress, and depression if they encounter setbacks. Children who learn to co-operate are likely to be more well-rounded and caring as adults and better able to cope with the complexities of the real world. In conclusion, I would say that competition is good in moderation but that in the long run, children should be taught to co-operate. In the long run, teaching children to co-operate is vital for developing a generation of compassionate, caring, and successful people.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.; Cooperation or competition has been the subject of a heated debate among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to their later life. Cooperation, on the other hand, leads to mutual respect and good relationships, which is essential to the formation of a strong community. Also, children working together towards a common goal learn to appreciate the strength and weakness of their partners, which leads to a more harmonious and productive team, which is especially important in the world where teamwork and collaboration are highly valued. Cooperation can also lead to a healthy sense of competition, which can lead to the feeling of a healthy obsession with winning, which in turn can lead to stress, anxiety and self-esteem when they fail. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with individual success, which can lead to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation helps children grow up to be more open, empathetic and productive adults. As they mature, they are better equipped to establish strong relationships, work in a team and make a positive contribution to their communities. In conclusion, while there is some benefit to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is the most effective way to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems."; To help children develop their social skills, they must be taught to work together. The debate over whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has sparked debate among teachers and parents. Cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect that are necessary for the formation of strong, long-lasting relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which makes them a more harmonious and productive team. Cooperation, therefore, is more valuable than competition. Too much competition can lead to a selfish attitude that places a high value on success, regardless of the circumstances. In this way, they will become too focused on winning, and they will be anxious, anxious and will lose their self-esteem if they have a bad time. Cooperation builds a child's self-confidence, empathy and respect for others. They can cope better with the complexities of the world and become more successful, productive and useful adults. In short, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, it is more beneficial to teach them to work together in the long run. Ultimately, teaching children to cooperate is essential for a generation of compassionate, cohesive and successful individuals.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.; Cooperation or competition is an issue that has long been discussed by educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for future success, others believe that teaching them to cooperate will help them to become more useful adults. Cooperation is also beneficial for forming long-lasting friendships and trust. When children work together, they can understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which in turn helps them to develop the team spirit, which is an important value in today's world. Competition, on the other hand, is often an overly individualistic attitude, which leads to the pursuit of success at all costs, and will eventually lead to stress and anxiety when they encounter obstacles, which will inevitably lead to self-esteem and self-esteem. Cooperation brings about harmony and helps children become more mature, more empathetic, and more useful adults. Children who know how to work together, share ideas, and help each other develop their skills, are more able to understand the complexity of the real world and the importance of forming strong relationships and working in a team to achieve common goals. To sum up, although there are some benefits to competition, I think it is more beneficial for children to learn cooperation. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of successful, empathetic, and successful people.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life."; Co-operation is a life skill that helps children develop social skills like communication, sharing, empathy, and problem solving. The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has led to much discussion among educators and parents. Co-operation helps build a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together, they learn to respect each other’s ideas and efforts, which makes for a more harmonious and productive team. In the real world, people work better together and with each other. In contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can result in anxiety and lowered self-esteem when they are faced with failure. Co-operation helps children become more well-rounded, more capable adults who can build strong relationships, work effectively in a team, and be more productive members of society. In conclusion, while competition can have its benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. If we want to raise a generation of children who can work together, be compassionate, and succeed in life, we should teach them to co-operate.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.; It is a widely discussed issue among educators and parents whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Those who argue that competition is important for children’s future success are wrong. Teaching children to cooperate gives them a better foundation for their future lives as productive members of society. In addition, working with others strengthens the development of mutual respect and trust, which is an important basis for building a solid relationship. When children work together they appreciate each other’s skills and knowledge, and this helps them to work together better in the future, when the ability to work in a group is a highly valued trait. Competition can lead to an unhealthy focus on winning, which can cause stress and anxiety, and a lack of self-esteem when things go wrong. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy focus on one’s own success, which can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, and, when things go wrong, to stress and low self-esteem. Cooperation develops a child’s capacity to work together, share ideas, and help each other, so that they grow into more mature, empathetic, and productive adults, who are better able to cope with the complex world around them, to work together in groups, and to contribute to the common good. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, it is more beneficial in the long run to teach children to cooperate. Those who teach children to cooperate are contributing to a generation of adults who are more empathetic, more able to work together, and more successful.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.; By focusing on cooperation, we can help children develop such essential social skills as negotiating, negotiating, coping with frustrations and understanding how others feel. Cooperation develops communication skills, which are useful for any adult. Cooperation also promotes respect and mutual trust, which is an important foundation for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which makes them more productive as a team. Cooperation also builds self-confidence, which is invaluable for coping with everyday problems. On the other hand, teaching children to compete often leads to an unhealthy focus on their own success, resulting in stress, anxiety and lower self-esteem when they fail. As they grow up, they will be able to negotiate the real world better, develop more cohesively and effectively, and play a positive role in their communities. Although teaching children to compete has its benefits, I believe that teaching them to cooperate will bring them greater benefits in the long run. Teaching children to cooperate is therefore essential to educating a generation of people who can cooperate, work together and achieve success.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.; He will learn to co-operate, thus developing in them social skills like communication, listening, understanding and problem solving. The controversy of whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate has led to a great deal of discussion among educators and parents. Also, co-operation promotes a sense of community and mutual respect, which is the basis for a strong and long-lasting relationship. When children work together for a common goal, they appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which in turn makes them more productive and less competitive. On the other hand, teaching children to compete leads to an overly individualistic attitude. They learn to put their own interests before those of others, which can lead to frustration, self-esteem problems, and sometimes even a decline in health. When children learn to co-operate, share ideas, and help each other, they become more confident and more empathetic, able to build strong relationships and contribute to their communities. In conclusion, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that the long-term benefits of teaching them to co-operate are more important. It is essential that children be taught to co-operate so that they will be compassionate, empathetic, and successful adults.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.; I am of the view that children should be taught to cooperate rather than compete. The teaching of children to compete has been a hot topic of debate among educators and parents for some time. I do not believe that a future of a person lies in competition. Cooperation instils in children important life skills such as communication, listening, empathy and the ability to solve problems. In addition, it promotes a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical in establishing strong, lasting relationships. Children learn to appreciate their fellow human beings, their strengths and weaknesses, thus creating a more harmonious and productive team. Moreover, cooperation prepares children for the world of work, where teamwork is highly appreciated. Furthermore, if competition is overemphasised, it can create an unhealthy emphasis on winning at all costs, which leads to a deterioration in sportsmanship and a loss of self-esteem. On the other hand, if children are taught to compete, they may become too egocentric, placing their personal success above the success of others, which in turn may lead to a lack of self-confidence and the feeling of being disadvantaged. Cooperation teaches children to work together, share ideas and support one another, enabling them to become more compassionate and productive adults, able to navigate the complexities of life and contribute to their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that cooperation is ultimately more beneficial. Children need to be taught to work together in order to raise a more compassionate, more effective and more successful generation.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste."; While some people claim that teaching children to compete with each other is the key to their future success, others argue that teaching children to work together is more beneficial. To my mind, there is a strong argument for teaching children to work together. If you teach them to work together, they will learn skills such as communication, empathy and the ability to solve problems. Besides, teamwork teaches them mutual respect, which is important for building strong and lasting relationships. Also, if children learn to work together to achieve a common goal, they will learn to understand the value of working together and be better prepared for life in a society where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Besides, a competition-based education can create a cutthroat mentality where children feel pressured to win at any cost, which undermines the value of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, a competition-based education can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, a constant sense of competition and, as a result, stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when children are faced with obstacles. Children who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other are more likely to grow up to be more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, who are able to work with others and contribute to society in a positive way. In conclusion, although there are advantages to both a competition-based and a teamwork-based education, I think it is better to teach children to work together. To my mind, teaching children to work together is vital for creating a compassionate, supportive and successful society.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person."; Among educators and parents, there is a lively discussion about whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate. Some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important for bringing up a responsible citizen. Cooperation teaches them the importance of mutual trust and respect, and it is also important for building a strong and lasting relationship. Children should learn to work together and value each other’s strengths and weaknesses. This will prepare them for their future lives where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Furthermore, if the emphasis is too much on competition, it may result in a cutthroat environment where children are encouraged to succeed at all costs, and this can undermine their sense of fair play and sportsmanship. If children are taught to compete, they may have an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to anxiety and depression when they fail, and they will lose self-esteem. Cooperation, on the other hand, teaches children to work together, share their ideas, and support each other. This will make them more empathetic and productive adults who will be able to manage the complexities of the real world more effectively and positively contribute to society. In conclusion, I would like to say that, although teaching children to compete has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important for their future success. Children need to be taught to work together to succeed in life.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.; Since many educators and parents believe that it is important to teach children to compete in order to make them more successful later on, I will argue that teaching children to work together would be more useful in their development as useful adults. To work together helps them develop important social skills such as cooperation, sharing, understanding and problem solving. Also, by working together they learn to respect each other, which is important in building strong, lasting relationships. Working together makes them realize that each of them has strengths and weaknesses, which leads to a more cohesive and more productive team. In addition, by stressing competition, we can create a situation where children feel they must succeed at all costs, and undermining the value of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which causes stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when there is a setback. To sum up, children who are taught to work together will become more mature, understanding and productive adults. In the real world they will be better able to build strong relationships, work effectively in a group and make a positive contribution to their communities. And the end result of teaching children to work together will be a generation of compassionate, successful and productive people.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.; However, there is an opinion that children should be taught to compete with each other in order to become useful adults. Although there are educators and parents who believe that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I am sure that it is much more useful to teach children to work together. Besides, if children work together, they can get along and respect each other, which is very important for future communication. Moreover, they can prepare children for the future, where a close relationship between people and solidarity are valued. There are also too many competitions that encourage children to achieve success at all costs, thereby reducing the importance of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete with each other creates in them a desire to achieve their own success, and this can lead to a lack of health, a desire to win at all costs, and, as a result, to anxiety and a decrease in self-esteem. From working together, sharing ideas and helping each other, children will become well-rounded, friendly and kind people, able to get along with others and build relationships in the future, and, having become capable of negotiating the difficulties of the world around them, will be able to build strong relationships, work in a team and positively affect their community. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has its advantages, I think that in the long run it is more useful to teach them to work together. Children must be taught to work together to raise a generation of kind, cooperative and successful people.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.; Contributing to society through education is a subject of intense debate among parents and educators. The question of whether children should be taught to compete or coexist has been a matter of great debate among educators and parents. Children who learn to coexist will have a better understanding of each other's weaknesses and strengths, which will help them build a harmonious team, which is necessary for their future teamwork in the real world. In addition, competition creates a high-pressure environment for children to win at all costs, and ruins the spirit of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition can lead to the development of an individualistic attitude that puts individual interests before others. This will lead to an unhealthy obsession with the pursuit of success, which will lead to anxiety, depression and lack of self-esteem when encountering difficulties. The children who grow up to work together, share ideas and work together can become more mature, empathetic and harmonious people, and have a better understanding of the world and can make a better contribution to society. Therefore, although competition has its own advantages, I think teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. A generation of compassionate, harmonious and successful people is necessary for the country's future.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound."; , but they are useful for children to learn. Whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has been a controversial issue among educators and parents for a long time. I firmly believe that children should be taught to cooperate, not to compete, in order to prepare them for their future careers. Cooperation not only promotes mutual trust and respect, but also helps children learn to work together in a group and achieve common goals, which is useful for their future work. Moreover, competition creates an atmosphere of violence, in which children feel the pressure of success, and even causes them to be obsessed with winning and competition, which can easily lead to low self-esteem and anxiety when they fail. Cooperation can help children build their emotional intelligence, and then help them build strong relationships with others, work together, and do their best in society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation is more beneficial to children in the long run. Cooperation can make children have a good relationship with others and have good social skills, which can help them live happily in society.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.; Competition or cooperation is the subject of many discussions among teachers and parents. While some people believe that competition makes children more successful, others argue that teaching cooperation makes them better. Cooperation teaches mutual respect and understanding, which is very important for the formation of relationships. When children cooperate in the classroom, they can appreciate each other's advantages and disadvantages, which will make them more cohesive and more productive in the future. Competition leads to a strong sense of self, a strong desire to achieve, a strong sense of self-confidence, and the destruction of the concept of fairness and equality. In addition, competition can lead to bullying, which is not conducive to teaching. Cooperation makes children well-rounded, empathetic, and self-reliant. In the real world, they will be able to establish close relationships, work together, and make positive contributions to the society. In conclusion, although competition has its own value, I still think that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. I think it is important to cultivate a generation of people who love each other and work well together.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.; In the midst of heated debates between teachers and parents about whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate, some argue that the children are more successful in the future when they learn to compete. I believe that children should be taught to cooperate more effectively for future use. Cooperation not only fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, but also trains children for the world where teamwork and harmony are valued. In addition, a strong focus on competition can cause unfair and unreasonable demands on children, and a sense of sportsmanship and courtesy can be undermined. On the other hand, teaching children to compete gives them a sense of individualism and competition, which makes them anxious and distressed when they encounter obstacles, and this may also result in a lack of self-confidence. In my opinion, when children learn to cooperate, they will be more sympathetic, mature and capable of dealing with the complexities of life, and they will be able to establish good relationships with others, work together and build harmonious societies. Finally, although there are many benefits to competition, I still think that teaching children to cooperate is better in the long run. Cooperation is the only way to educate a compassionate and united generation of people.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.; The debate about whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has sparked many heated discussions among educators and parents. While some claim that teaching children to compete is more useful for their future, I am sure that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for their future. Teaching children to cooperate develops essential social skills such as communication, understanding, and problem-solving. Besides, it helps to build a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for the development of strong and lasting relationships. When children cooperate to achieve a common goal, they learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, and they are able to form a harmonious and effective group. Besides, they will be able to better adapt to the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Also, competition creates a cutthroat environment where children are encouraged to achieve at all costs, ignoring the importance of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish mindset in which they only care about their own success, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a loss of self-esteem when they face setbacks. When children learn to share, work together, and support each other, they develop into more well-rounded, compassionate, and successful adults who are able to effectively navigate the complexities of the real world. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, teaching children to cooperate is more useful for their future. Ultimately, teaching children to cooperate is essential for raising a compassionate, successful, and productive generation.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.; Some people argue that it is necessary to teach children to compete in order to prepare them for their future careers. I believe that children should be taught to work together and they will develop a lot of necessary skills, such as cooperation, communication, sensitivity, and so on. Cooperation is a common activity that builds relationships and community. This prepares children for adulthood, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, is a dangerous and insidious phenomenon, which not only brings an unhealthy obsession with winning, but also leads to a decline in self-esteem and stress when it is lost. From the time children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, they will become more developed, empathetic and useful adults. They will know how to build relationships and contribute to the development of their environment. In conclusion, although there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching them to work together will be more beneficial for them in the long run. The main thing is to raise a generation of children who are sensitive, work well together and achieve success.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.; Amongst educators and parents there has been much debate over the years about whether it is best to teach children to compete or to work together. Some believe that teaching children to compete is the best way to prepare them for their future. However, I strongly disagree with this view and believe that children should be taught to work together. This would prepare them for the real world where cooperation and teamwork are the order of the day. In addition, it would give children a sense of community and mutual respect, which would help them to build strong relationships with others. Besides, if the emphasis is too much on competition, the children could develop an unhealthy obsession with winning at all costs, which could affect their self-esteem. On the other hand, teaching children to compete could lead to an unhealthy emphasis on individualism and success at the expense of others, resulting in stress and anxiety if they are not successful, leading to the loss of self-esteem. Children, who learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, will develop into more well-rounded, empathic and productive adults who will be better equipped to handle the complexities of the real world and to work together effectively as a team. To sum up, while teaching children to compete has some benefits, I think that teaching them to work together would have more long-term benefits. Teaching children to work together is essential if we are to raise a generation of caring, sharing and successful people.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children."; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or to cooperate has been a topic of debate among teachers and parents. Some educators and parents believe that teaching children to compete is important for their future success, but I strongly disagree. Teaching children to cooperate is useful for them to become good and useful adults. Cooperation helps children develop a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential for building strong, lasting relationships. Cooperation can help children learn to appreciate and make use of each other's strengths and weaknesses, and thus help them work well together in the future. Cooperation can also help children develop a sense of fair play and sportsmanship. Competition can create a cutthroat environment in which children feel that they must win at all costs, and this kind of behavior can lead to a lack of self-esteem, and when they lose, it is not easy for them to overcome the psychological effect of defeat. Cooperation can help children learn to work together, share ideas, and support each other, which will help them become more mature, sympathetic, and helpful adults. In my opinion, although there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation can help children become more mature, responsible, and successful people.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.; Discuss both sides and give your own opinion. - There is a lot of debate in schools and in society about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. I believe that teaching children to cooperate will be more beneficial for their future development than teaching them to compete. Co-operation builds a sense of community and mutual respect that is needed for strong relationships. In the real world, cooperation and teamwork are highly appreciated. In addition, competition can create a cutthroat environment where the winners are always those who played the most, which also undermines the value of fair play and the feeling of good sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition leads to an individualistic mindset where one has to be successful at all costs. Often it is even more important for them to win than to help others, which may lead to unhealthy competition, and when they fail they are anxious and may lose self-esteem. Co-operation builds on mutual support, sharing and support. Children will grow up to be more well-rounded, sympathetic and productive adults who can navigate the complexities of the real world, create strong relationships, work effectively as a team and make a positive contribution to their communities. In conclusion, while competition has its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. In the end, it is the education of children to cooperate that will ensure a generation of well-adjusted, cooperative and successful people.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.; To be able to compete, children must be taught to be hardworking and resilient, while others argue that cooperation must be learned to become useful adults. Cooperation is not only important for children to learn, but also to be able to communicate and be empathetic, so it is useful for them to develop their ability to solve problems and be more sensitive. It is also useful to be able to build a relationship of mutual respect and trust, which is the basis of the relationship. In addition, when children cooperate to achieve the same goal, they will learn to understand each other's strength and weakness, and this will also make them fit into the real world, where cooperation is valued. Competition is a self-reliance, a win-win mentality that strives for personal success and, when it does not work, the spirit of fairness and sportsmanship. Then, the tendency to be a little individualistic, which is harmful to children's mental health, and it is not enough to teach them to be able to cooperate when they meet the pitfalls. Cooperation will make children become more mature, and as they grow up, they will be able to build strong relationships and work as a team to build a better society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, teaching children to cooperate is better in the long run. Cooperation is the best way to raise the next generation of people who are sympathetic, capable of coexisting, and successful.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.; The debate on whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has been a matter of intense debate among educators and parents for a long time. While some claim that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is far more beneficial for their later lives. Cooperation creates a feeling of community and respect that is necessary for a strong and lasting relationship. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate the individual skills and talents of others, which results in a more productive and harmonious team. Cooperation also teaches children to work together, which is a good preparation for the working world, where the importance of cooperation and teamwork is well understood. The alternative, teaching children to compete, can result in unhealthy competition, where the individual’s success is placed above all others. It can also lead to a loss of self-esteem and confidence in the face of failure. Cooperation also helps children to develop a broader range of skills, such as the ability to share ideas and work with others. In the real world, this makes them more able to negotiate complex situations, forge strong relationships and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, although both methods have advantages, I think that teaching children to cooperate is far more beneficial. It is essential to developing a caring, supportive and successful generation of people.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.; Writing task 2: The best way to raise children is to teach them to compete or work together. This question has been a topic of heated debate amongst educators and parents. While some believe that a good education should teach children to compete and this is the best way to ensure their future success, I disagree and think that a good education should teach children to work together. Co-operation builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which are critical for the establishment of long-lasting and strong relationships. Children who learn to work together towards a common goal are more harmonious and productive. For instance, a co-operative atmosphere makes children realize that they are in a supportive community and this eliminates the feeling of stress and anxiety when they encounter difficulties. In contrast, teaching children to compete makes them more individualistic, they think about themselves more than about others, they may have a disproportionate obsession with winning and they may suffer from stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they encounter failure. Moreover, when children are taught to work together, share ideas and support each other, they will develop into well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults. As they face the complexity of the real world, they will be able to build strong relationships, work more effectively in teams and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, I believe that, although there are benefits in teaching children to compete, it is better to teach them to work together. As a result, we can raise a generation of children who are compassionate, harmonious and successful.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.; When deciding whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate, educators and parents are divided on the issue. Some educators and parents argue that teaching children to compete is better for their future success, but others, such as myself, believe that if children are taught to cooperate, they will develop more social skills and become better citizens. Cooperation is also a way to build a sense of community and mutual respect, which is useful for building long-lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve the same goal, they will learn to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, which will lead to a more productive and harmonious team. Moreover, an excessive emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment where children feel they must win at any cost, which may lead to the development of unsportsmanlike conduct and lead to a decrease in self-esteem. On the other hand, when children are taught to compete, they may develop an unhealthy sense of individuality, and when they fail, they may be upset, anxious and depressed. Cooperation is more likely to make children become mature, capable and able to communicate with each other, so that they can learn to build strong relationships, work effectively with each other, and contribute to society. In conclusion, although competition has its own advantages, I believe that cooperation is the most important in the long run. I think that teaching children to cooperate is the most effective way to raise a compassionate, united and successful generation.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.; How to teach children to work together. Although it has become a frequent topic of debate among parents and educators, the question of whether children should be taught to compete or to work together is an issue that continues to occupy their minds. Cooperation can foster a sense of community and mutual respect, which in turn is vital for building strong, lasting relationships. Also, working together allows children to appreciate each other’s talents and abilities, which can also be useful in the workplace, where teams and collaboration are also common. It is also possible that an over-emphasis on competition can create a cut-throat atmosphere, in which children are forced to succeed at any cost, and in the process undermining the concept of fair play. In contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can in turn lead to self-doubt and a lack of self-esteem. By contrast, if children are taught to share, work together and help each other, they will grow into adults who are more well-rounded, more capable and more able to deal with the complexities of the real world. In my opinion, although both ways have their advantages, I believe that encouraging children to work together has a greater overall benefit. In the long run, it will be better for children to learn to work together, because this will enable them to be kinder, more compassionate, and more likely to succeed.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.; It has been argued that children should be taught to compete rather than to co-operate in their upbringing. I believe that children should be taught to co-operate in order to develop their social skills, for example, listening, communication, empathetic skills and the ability to solve problems. Besides, co-operation can lead to a sense of solidarity and mutual respect, which is necessary for a long-lasting relationship. Co-operation also helps children to learn about each other's abilities and skills, which leads to a better, more productive and efficient team and prepares them for the real world, where co-operation and teamwork are essential. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an excessively individualistic and winning mentality and a harmful emphasis on success, which can lead to stress, anxiety and self-esteem problems in children who are not successful in their lives. Children, who learn to co-operate, share ideas and support each other, are more rounded, sympathetic and productive adults, and when they enter the complex world, they will be better equipped to form strong relationships, work well in a team and contribute positively to society. To sum up, although competition has some benefits, I think it is more beneficial for children to be taught to co-operate. Therefore, I believe that children should be taught to co-operate.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.; The essay should be at least 250 words. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has provoked lively discussion among parents and teachers. Some claim that teaching children to compete is important for their future success, while I argue that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial for their adult life. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential for building strong, long-lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s abilities and thus to form a more productive and harmonious group. This is the kind of co-operation that is required in the workplace, where working in a team is regarded as the best approach. Competition, on the other hand, encourages an individualistic attitude and an unhealthy focus on winning, which can lead to anxiety and depression. Children who are taught to work together, share ideas and help each other will become more confident and resourceful, and will be better prepared for life in the real world. In conclusion, while I agree that there are some advantages of teaching children to compete, I think teaching them to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. Children who are taught to co-operate will grow into successful, compassionate and caring adults.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.; Cooperation is the basis for all learning and development, especially the social skills such as negotiating, persuading, empathising, and problem-solving. Educators and parents are deeply divided over whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Cooperation creates a sense of community and mutual respect that is essential to building strong, lasting relationships. In the long run, cooperation prepares children for a world where the importance of teamwork and cooperation are universally recognized. The culture of competition also creates a cutthroat atmosphere that undermines the values of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to unhealthy obsessions with winning and losing, resulting in stress, anxiety, and lower self-esteem when they experience failure. Cooperation also enables children to become more empathetic, supportive, and productive adults. Finally, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that the long-term benefits of cooperation outweigh those of competition. Cooperation is essential to raising a generation of compassionate, cooperative, and successful adults.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.; Since when do we want to teach children to compete or co-operate? This question has become a major topic of debate among parents and educators. Some claim that children must learn to compete in order to be successful later in life. Others, however, believe that co-operation makes children more useful adults. Co-operation teaches children to respect each other and build long-term relationships. By working together, children learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of others and they become better prepared for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition on the other hand can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to high stress and a loss of self-esteem when there are failures. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that the long-term advantages of teaching children to work together outweigh the advantages of teaching them to compete. In addition, a cooperative education is essential for the formation of a generation of people who are empathetic, cooperative and successful.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.; To teach children to compete or co-operate has long been a controversial issue among educators and parents. Some people believe that children should be taught to compete to make them successful in life, but I believe that children should be taught to work together to make them useful people in society. Cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is vital to the building of long-term relationships. In addition, it can prepare children for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Competition, on the other hand, teaches children to focus on themselves, and if they focus on winning, they will be disappointed and their self-esteem will be low. It is also worth noting that if competition is excessive, children may have an unhealthy obsession with success, and when they fail, they may feel discouraged and anxious. By learning to work together, share ideas and support each other, children can become more well-rounded, empathetic and useful adults. As they enter a complex world, they can build long-lasting relationships, work well in groups and contribute to society. In short, although competition can also bring some benefits to children, I believe that the long-term benefits of teaching children to work together will be more beneficial than competition. In the end, it is the education of children that will ensure a generation of people who can work together and succeed.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.; Teaching children to cooperate with each other develops essential social skills such as communication, listening, empathy and solving problems. Teaching children to compete with each other develops essential social skills such as listening, empathy and problem solving. Cooperation also fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical in building strong, lasting relationships. This prepares children for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also encourages fair play and sportsmanship. Competition, on the other hand, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can result in stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when faced with failure. By learning to work together, share ideas and support each other, children become more well-rounded, empathetic and productive adults, who are better able to cope with the complexities of real life, build strong relationships, work effectively in a team and contribute positively to their communities. In conclusion, while competition does have its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is an essential skill for raising a generation of compassionate, productive and successful people.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.; Cooperation or competition has become a subject of debate in schools and among parents. There is a growing belief that a sense of competition is essential for the success of a child’s future life. I believe that a sense of cooperation is a much more useful thing to teach a child, as it enables him to develop social skills like tolerance, understanding, communication, and problem-solving. Cooperation also develops a sense of community and respect for others, which are vital for long-lasting relationships. Cooperation also enables children to understand and appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, so they can work together in harmony and produce something together. This also prepares them for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. In addition, an over-emphasis on competition may create a cut-throat environment in which children feel pressured to succeed at any cost, which can result in unhealthy obsessions with winning and loss of self-esteem. In contrast, teaching children to compete encourages them to be overly individualistic, and when they fail, they become overly anxious and lose self-confidence. Cooperation, on the other hand, develops children into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who can navigate the complexities of the real world more effectively, build solid relationships, work together more productively, and contribute more to their communities. In conclusion, although competition is necessary, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation develops well-rounded, empathetic, and productive individuals, who can then go on to be productive and successful in life.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.; Travelling has become a popular way of life all over the world. With the help of modern technology, more and more people can visit the same places as in the past. Various edu-cational institutes have delved into the topic of whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. While some think that learning to compete is more important for their future success, I strongly believe that teaching children to co-operate is much more beneficial to their future lives. Co-operation develops mutual respect and an understanding of each other’s problems, which is the foundation of long-lasting friendships. When children work together they can learn to appreciate each other’s different talents, which in turn makes them better equipped for the future when teamwork and collaboration are essential for success. Competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which could lead to a lack of self-confidence, anxiety and lowered self-esteem if they have any failures. On the other hand, competition can lead to an overly individualistic attitude and the children may be overly concerned about their own successes, and so on. They will be less able to form close relationships and to collaborate with others in the future. I believe that if children are taught to work together and help each other, they will grow into more rounded and productive people. In my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is the key to raising a generation of kind, helpful and successful people.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.; Talk about how the development of IT could be of positive as well as negative benefit to society. The question of whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has been the subject of heated debate among educators and parents for centuries. Cooperation teaches children to respect and appreciate the efforts of others, which is a good lesson for later life. Cooperation also helps children learn how to live together in a community, which in turn helps them to be better prepared for life in a world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also helps children learn to follow the rules of the game and follow the rules of fairness. Competition, on the other hand, can make children too selfish, where success is measured in relation to other people, where the fear of not winning and the constant stress and anxiety of the setbacks of others, where the nagging desire to win makes them feel anxiety and stress. Cooperation, on the other hand, helps children learn to work together, share ideas and support each other, which in turn helps them become empathetic, productive and more tolerant adults, who are better able to handle the complexity of life in the real world, where they can build relationships, work in teams and contribute to society. In conclusion, although competition can have its advantages, I think that cooperation is ultimately more beneficial to children. Cooperation is the best way to raise a compassionate, caring and successful generation.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.; , explain your answer and give a counter argument. Edu-cation policy should be designed to promote cooperation rather than competition among children. While some educators and parents argue that teaching children to compete is more beneficial for their future success, I disagree and believe that promoting children's cooperation is more effective in producing useful adults. Cooperation teaches children to respect each other and work together. This enables them to function as a team when they are older and in the workforce, where collaboration and teamwork are essential to success. Also, too much competition creates an environment where children feel that they must win at any cost, thus undermining the value of fairness and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete may lead to an unhealthy individualistic attitude, where the priority is one's own success rather than that of others, causing them to suffer from stress and anxiety when they are not successful. Cooperation, on the other hand, encourages children to share ideas, work together, and support each other. Consequently, children develop into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults, who can work effectively in groups and contribute to society. In sum, although competition can have its advantages, I believe that teaching children to cooperate will have a longer-lasting beneficial effect on their future lives. It is essential for raising a generation of children who are empathetic, cooperative, and successful.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.; Why? Cooperation, or competition, between children and adults, has become a controversial issue of education. Although some claim that competition is the best way of teaching children to achieve success in life, I believe that cooperation will make them more useful as adults. Cooperation builds a sense of unity and respect for others, which is an essential ingredient in establishing strong relationships. When children cooperate with each other, they learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, and it makes them a more productive team. In addition, cooperation helps children to become good workers when they enter a working environment, where they will be expected to work in a group. Competition, on the other hand, is more likely to create a cut-throat atmosphere in which children feel under pressure to win at all costs. Competition also encourages the desire to compete, which in turn leads to stress and anxiety, and a sense of self-reproach when a child is unsuccessful. Cooperation makes children more likely to grow up to be successful, empathetic and useful adults. They will be able to deal with the complexities of the world, work as part of a team and be useful to society. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think that teaching children to cooperate with each other will be more useful in the long run. Cooperation between children and adults is essential to raise a generation of kind, capable and successful people.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty."; This is an important debate in schools and between parents and educators. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial for them as useful adults. Teaching children to cooperate develops their social skills, such as collaborating, understanding, and problem-solving. Furthermore, cooperation promotes a sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential for building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's abilities and strengths, which makes for a more harmonious and productive group. Also, a too-high emphasis on competition can create an unhealthy environment where children feel they have to win at all costs, causing them to lose their sense of fair play and sportsmanship. In contrast, teaching children to compete can lead to a more individualistic mindset, a preoccupation with personal success and a low self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. Cooperation develops children into more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. In the real world, they are more likely to work in teams, build strong relationships, and help their communities. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. In the end, teaching children to cooperate is essential for the development of a generation of compassionate, empathetic, and successful adults.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.; How can you benefit from helping your children develop a sense of cooperation? The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has aroused a great deal of debate among educators and parents. Cooperation among students can help build a sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential to the development of good, lasting relationships. Children, working together, learn the strengths and weaknesses of their colleagues, which will help them when they enter the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. For its part, competition, when it becomes too strong, creates an environment in which children are urged to achieve at any cost, and thus destroys fairness and sportsmanship. Competition can also lead to an unhealthy obsession with the importance of one's own success and success, which can lead to anxiety, depression and self-esteem problems. Cooperation among children helps them to grow into well-rounded, empathetic, productive and efficient adults, who will be able to handle the complexity of life and build strong relationships and contribute to the development of society. In my opinion, although there are advantages to teaching children to compete, teaching them to cooperate can be more beneficial for them in the long run. Cooperation in children is a necessary condition for their later empathetic, efficient and successful work.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages."; The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has aroused heated discussions amongst educators and parents. While some people say that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I am convinced that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in making them useful adults. As a result, they are more likely to appreciate each other’s differences and accept each other’s shortcomings. This prepares them for the world outside, where working together is essential. Also, too much emphasis on competition creates a ruthless and vicious atmosphere where the children are forced to win at all costs. Besides, when they lose, they are left with a feeling of guilt, causing them to lose their self-confidence. It is better to encourage them to share ideas and support each other, as it makes them more confident and self-reliant in the long run. In conclusion, although there is merit in both methods, I believe that a more lasting and useful result is obtained by encouraging children to co-operate. Thus, we can be confident that we are bringing up a generation of people who are capable of co-operation, sympathy and success.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance."; In the past few years, many educators and parents have discussed the question of whether children should be taught to compete or to co-operate. Some claim that children should be taught to compete, arguing that this is necessary for their future success. However, I am convinced that a co-operative approach is more beneficial in preparing children to become useful members of society. Firstly, children learn to work together, appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and learn to form good, lasting relationships. In addition, children learn to respect each other. Secondly, competition can lead to a situation in which children feel forced to win at any cost, and this can lead to their feeling frustrated and angry, resulting in a loss of self-esteem. On the other hand, competition can lead to the development of an overly individualistic attitude, where the only thing that matters is personal success, and this can lead to unhealthy competition and a loss of self-esteem when they meet setbacks. Thirdly, I believe that children who learn to co-operate develop into people with good social skills who are able to cope with life's problems. In conclusion, while it is useful for children to learn to compete, I am convinced that a co-operative approach is better for children's long-term development. It is essential for the development of a sociable, efficient and successful nation that children should be taught to co-operate.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.; If a child is taught to compete, he learns how to win, but if he is taught to co-operate, he learns how to work together. This argument has caused much discussion among educators and parents, and I believe that teaching a child to co-operate is more useful than teaching a child to compete. Also, a feeling of mutual respect and friendship is an important thing for the child, which can then continue in the future in the real world, where it is also appreciated. When children work together for a common goal, they appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which will give them a more harmonious and efficient group, and they will be better prepared for the world of business, where a team spirit is valued. As for competition, it can lead to a child putting too much emphasis on winning and, when he is a child, he becomes too occupied with the question of winning and loses his peace of mind, is more anxious, and has less self-esteem when he fails. Competition also encourages children to have many ideas, but they can also take their ideas for granted. Co-operation, on the other hand, leads children to become well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults who are better prepared for the complexities of the world, to form strong relationships, work together, and contribute to the common good. Children must be taught to work together to raise a generation of people who can be united, kind and productive.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.; I completely disagree with this statement. Teaching children to coexist is more beneficial to their future development than teaching them to compete. Coexisting also teaches children to respect and appreciate each other, which is an important foundation for building long-term relationships. The coexistence of children makes them more harmonious and fruitful in their future life and also prepares them for future teamwork in the team. Competition in children often creates an environment where they feel they must win at all costs, reducing fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition in children creates an overly individualistic attitude in them, leading them to be more self-reliant and more susceptible to disappointment and depression. Coexistence in children can build more harmonious and empathetic adults. When children grow up, they will be more able to make friends, work in groups and contribute to society. In conclusion, although competition has its own benefits, I believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial in the long run. Coexistence is the basis for raising a generation of empathetic, cooperative and successful people.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.; Explain why you are right. Whether or not to teach children to compete or coexist has been a controversial issue among educators and parents. I believe that teaching children to coexist is more beneficial for their development as adults than teaching them to compete. For one thing, children who work together can appreciate each other's weaknesses and strengths, which makes it easier for the team to work together, and that is an important lesson for them in their later lives, which is an important skill for future life. For another thing, children who compete too much are in danger of being selfish, and they are more inclined to value their own interests and achievements than others. Secondly, they are obsessed with winning too much, and they may become anxious and low self-esteem when they lose. In addition, children who work together and support each other are more capable of building relationships with others, helping each other and learning to work together in the future. The complexities of the world. In the end, teaching children to work together is a very effective way to cultivate a group of people who are compassionate, capable and successful.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.; The question of whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has aroused much controversy amongst educators and parents, and while some people insist that competition is the best foundation for success in later life, I believe that teaching children to co-operate makes them better able to cope with life as an adult. Surely the skills that they learn through co-operation are just as essential for later success. This also teaches them to be good team members, which is an invaluable lesson for a life in the real world, where collaboration and team work are valued. When children are made to work together to achieve a common goal, they learn to respect each other’s abilities and differences of opinion, which in turn helps them to become a cohesive and productive team in later life. For another thing, competition teaches children to try to win at all costs, which makes them less inclined to play by the rules and can undermine their self-confidence. On the other hand, competition can lead to a tendency to be too individualistic and place their own success above the success of others, which in turn can lead to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when they meet with failure. The skills that they learn through co-operation, such as sharing ideas and supporting one another, help children to become more empathetic, responsible and productive adults who are better able to manage the complexities of life as an adult. In conclusion, I would argue that while there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, in the long run, the benefits of teaching children to co-operate outweigh those of teaching them to compete. Co-operation is, ultimately, the best way to teach children how to be empathetic, effective and successful adults.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.; The ability to communicate, listen and share is an essential skill for a child to develop. Educators and parents are now debating whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Cooperation develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which are the foundation for strong, long-term relationships. When children work together for a common goal, they learn to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of each other, which leads to a more harmonious and productive team. It also prepares them for the real world, where cooperation and teamwork are highly valued. For children who are encouraged to compete from an early age, the over-emphasis on competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation teaches children to share, listen and respect each other, which makes them more well-rounded and productive adults. Cooperation is more beneficial in the long run. It makes for a more compassionate, cohesive and successful generation.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.; This has always been a debate between teachers and parents, namely, should we teach children to compete or cooperate? The school debate has been heated for years, but I think teaching children to cooperate is more important than preparing them to compete. Cooperation teaches children to respect each other and is useful for establishing strong and lasting relationships. Cooperation also trains them to work together and appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which is very important for later work. Cooperation can also prevent the generation of a class of children who feel like they have to achieve success at all costs, and to some extent they also ignore the importance of fairness and honesty. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an egocentric and selfish way of thinking, causing them to be obsessed with their own success, which in turn leads to frustration and a loss of self-esteem. Cooperation will develop children into more well-rounded, sensitive, and effective people who can work together and contribute to the community. In short, although competition is useful for the future, I think the benefits of teaching children to cooperate outweigh those of competition. Cooperation is the foundation for a society of sensitive, helpful and successful people.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.; I think that teaching children to work together is more important than teaching them to compete, because teaching children to work together develops a set of important social skills, such as communication, care, and the ability to solve problems. Cooperation helps children develop social skills, such as communication, empathy, and the ability to solve problems. Also, co-operation creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary to build strong and lasting relationships. When children work together to achieve a common goal, they can understand each other's strength and weakness, and can produce more harmonious and productive teams. Therefore, it is useful for children to learn to work together. However, competition can also have its benefits, but too much competition will lead to a child's obsession with success, which can lead to low self-esteem and other psychological problems. Cooperation is the foundation for a more empathetic, understanding, and productive adult. The ability to work together and share ideas can help children develop into mature people who can build relationships, solve problems, and contribute to society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I think teaching children to work together will bring more long-term benefits. Ultimately, I think teaching children to work together is the best way to cultivate a generation of empathetic, unified, and successful people.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy."; Give three arguments to support your view and write the end of your essay. The debate between parents and teachers about whether it is good to teach children to compete or cooperate has always been intense. Many people argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success. I am convinced that teaching children to cooperate is more useful in preparing useful adults. In addition, a sense of community and mutual respect are developed in children, which are very important for building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's skills and weaknesses, which leads to more harmony and productivity in a team. In addition, they are more prepared for the outside world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation in the classroom does not necessarily mean that children lose their individuality and lose the ability to succeed and achieve in life. Competition in the classroom can lead to unhealthy compulsion, which can cause anxiety, stress and low self-esteem when children fail. Cooperation in the classroom is useful because children are well rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. When they grow up and face the complexities of the real world, they will be able to build strong relationships and contribute to their communities in a positive way. In conclusion, teaching children to cooperate is necessary for raising a generation of empathetic, successful, and productive people.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.; This essay is for IELTS and explains all the rules of IELTS in details. The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or to work together has caused a lot of discussion among teachers and parents. It is argued that teaching children to compete is a better way to ensure their success in life, but I firmly believe that teaching children to work together is a better way to make them useful adults. A better understanding of how people operate in a team is developed by working together. It also builds up respect for one another and helps children to learn to respect others. When children are made to compete, they may feel under pressure to win at all costs and this can result in unhealthy obsession with winning and unhealthy stress, anxiety and lack of self-esteem when they fail. On the other hand, teaching children to compete encourages them to place too much emphasis on their own personal achievements and they can become obsessed with winning at the expense of others and this can cause depression and stress. Working together develops skills in children that enable them to build good relationships and work effectively as a team to overcome the complexities of real life. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I believe that working together is more beneficial in the long run. Children should be taught to work together to raise a generation of compassionate, cooperative and successful individuals.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school."; This has led to a heated discussion between educators and parents. While some argue that children should be taught to compete, some others argue that children should be taught to cooperate. Cooperation brings people together and helps them to get along with each other and it also helps to build a sense of community. The other benefit of cooperation is that it prepares children for life, where teamwork is necessary. The overemphasis on competition may also create a cut-throat atmosphere in which children feel under tremendous pressure to succeed at all costs, thereby undermining the importance of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, encouraging children to compete leads to the development of a very individualistic mindset. They place their own success before the success of others. They are driven by a desire to win at all costs, which can lead to a stress and low self-esteem when they encounter a setback. Cooperation develops children into well-rounded, more empathetic, and productive adults. It makes them more capable of building strong relationships, working in a team, and making a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, while there are some benefits to competition, in the long run, cooperation is more beneficial. Children should be taught to cooperate if we want to raise a generation of compassionate, hardworking, and successful adults.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.; I think it's better for children to learn to work together than to compete with each other. There is an ongoing debate about whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Some argue that children should compete to achieve success in the future. But I think it is better to teach children to cooperate to make them useful adults. Cooperation can create a strong sense of community and mutual respect, which is the basis for establishing good, lasting relationships. Besides, when children work together to achieve a common goal, they will appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and work together more efficiently. In this way, they will be more ready to face the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, competition can lead to a vicious circle of unhealthy competition, undermining the concept of fairness and sportsmanship, and bringing about a series of stress and depression when children fail. Ultimately, children who have learned to share, help, and communicate with each other will be more helpful and willing to help each other. To work together, and to share and help each other, will be able to enter the real world more confidently, have a better sense of self-confidence, and can make a better contribution to society. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that cooperation is more beneficial to children in the long run. In this way, we can also raise a generation of more caring and successful people.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.; Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of having guns in the hands of police. In the past few years, educators and parents have been debating whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate. While some argue that competition is better for future success, others believe that cooperation is more beneficial for children’s development as good citizens. Cooperation enables children to respect each other’s skills and views and to build up a sense of community. When children work together towards a common goal, they can appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which can lead to a more cohesive and productive team, and this can also help children in their future careers. In addition, excessive emphasis on competition can lead to an unhealthy emphasis on success and the undermining of the values of fair play and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic mindset where they place their own success above others, which can result in them becoming too prone to anxiety and stress, and losing their self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. Cooperation can help children to develop into more responsible, mature and empathetic adults who can negotiate the complexity of the real world and make a positive contribution to their communities. In conclusion, while teaching children to compete has its advantages, I believe that a combination of competition and cooperation is the best approach in the long run. Teaching children to cooperate will help to raise a new generation of empathetic, team-oriented and successful individuals.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.; This question has always caused a great deal of debate among teachers and parents: whether it is better to teach children to compete or cooperate? Cooperation creates community and respect among children, which is important in building strong, lasting relationships. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other’s talents and abilities, and to work as a cohesive and productive group. In the world at large, teamwork and cooperation are valued highly, and it will be easier for them to deal with the challenges they may face later on. Competition, on the other hand, leads to a selfish attitude and an unhealthy obsession with winning, which can result in stress, anxiety, and a low self-esteem if the children are unable to achieve their goals. In teaching cooperation, children will learn to work together, share ideas, and support each other, and become more mature, well-rounded adults who can work in a team and be more productive in the long run. In conclusion, while there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, in the long run it is more beneficial to teach them to cooperate. Cooperation is the foundation of a compassionate, cooperative, and successful society.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously."; We also have a big argument in education, whether to teach children to compete or to work together. Some argue that children should compete because they are essential for success in the future. I think that children should learn to work together because they develop the skills of social communication, empathy and problem solving. For example, it is a good preparation for the adult world, where collaboration and teamwork are appreciated. Besides, when children work together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, which results in a better and more efficient team. Children who are taught to compete, on the other hand, will develop an individualistic and selfish view of the world, where they value personal success more than that of others, and there is an unhealthy obsession with winning, which causes stress, anxiety and low self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. In addition, they will be less able to cope with the real world where it is more complicated and where they need to build relationships, work in teams and positively contribute to the community. In conclusion, although competition has some benefits, I believe that teaching children to work together has a better long-term effect. The development of a cooperative and successful society is ultimately dependent on the education of children to work together.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.; I believe that children should be taught to co-operate rather than compete. Although some people argue that competition is essential for children's future success, I think that teaching children to cooperate would make them more useful adults in the future. Firstly, cooperation builds a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for building strong relationships. Secondly, when children work together, they will appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and this will be useful for future teamwork in the future. Thirdly, an emphasis on competition can create a hostile environment where children feel the need to win at all costs, which undermines fair play and the importance of good sportsmanship. On the other hand, competition makes children too individualistic and gives them an unhealthy obsession with winning, which leads to stress, anxiety and self-esteem when they fail. Fourthly, children who learn to share, co-operate and support each other become more capable of coping with the complexities of real life and are more able to form relationships with each other. In conclusion, although there are benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate in the long run. Cooperation is the key to raising a generation of compassionate, helpful and successful people.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.; The controversy of whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has raised a lot of discussions amongst the teachers and the parents. I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate would be better for them to become a useful adult. . . . Cooperation creates a sense of belonging, which is very important in building strong and lasting relationships. It enables children to learn about each other's talents and to work as a harmonious and productive group. This will also help them in the future when they are working in groups. . . . . On the other hand, teaching children to compete may make them very individualistic, so that they become obsessed with winning, which could make them very unhappy and anxious when they face failure. And they would not be able to learn from each other how to work together and help each other. . . . In conclusion, though teaching children to compete is important, I think teaching children to co-operate would be more beneficial in the long run. . . . . To create a successful and happy generation, we need to encourage children to work together.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.; The pedagogical issue whether children should be educated to compete or to cooperate has caused a lot of debate between educators and parents. Some claim that competition is the key to success in the future, while I firmly believe that teaching children to cooperate is the best way to help them grow up to be useful and self-confident people. Cooperation instills mutual respect and respect for others, which is an important foundation for a healthy relationship. When children work together, they can better appreciate the individual abilities of each other, which will make them a more cohesive and productive team in the future. The environment of competition can be very harsh, where children feel the pressure to achieve success at any cost, which can be detrimental to the development of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an excessively individualistic attitude, where children set their success against the success of others, which in turn leads to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-confidence when they fail. Cooperation helps children develop into a more cohesive and cooperative adult, which is better able to solve problems in the real world, build relationships, and work in a team. In conclusion, although competition has its advantages, I think it is better to teach children to cooperate in the long run. It is in this way that we can educate a generation of children who can work together with others and be successful in the future.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.; ? The debate on whether to teach children to compete or cooperate has a strong impact on the lives of teachers and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is necessary for their future success, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for their later life. Cooperation brings about a strong sense of community and mutual respect, which is essential to the development of strong relationships. Cooperation also prepares children for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are valued. Furthermore, teaching children to compete can lead to unhealthy obsessions with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when they encounter difficulties. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic attitude, in which they place themselves above others. Cooperation develops the qualities of tolerance, empathetic and compassionate people. Those who learn to cooperate will be able to create strong and positive relationships with others, and they will be able to share the responsibilities of working together. In conclusion, although teaching children to compete has some advantages, I think that teaching children to cooperate is more useful for the long run. Cooperation is the most effective way to raise a generation of successful, compassionate and selfless people.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in."; Whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has long been a topic of discussion among parents and educators. Whereas some people argue that teaching children to compete is the best way to ensure their future success, I strongly believe that encouraging children to cooperate will give them the skills they need to become responsible and decent adults. Cooperation is also the key to a mutual respect, which is necessary for the establishment of lasting relationships. Moreover, by working together toward a common goal, children learn to respect each other's strengths and weaknesses, which is also important in establishing strong relationships with others. And finally, by placing too much emphasis on competition, children learn that they have to succeed at all costs, which can lead to a lack of fairness and sportsmanship. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a rather selfish mindset, which will make them want to achieve success at any cost, and, in turn, lead to high levels of stress and low self-esteem when they fail to do so. Cooperation, on the other hand, helps children learn to share ideas and support each other, which, in turn, will help them cope better with the complex realities of the real world, where they will have to learn how to build strong relationships and work in teams to produce the best results. In conclusion, although there are benefits to both teaching children to compete and teaching them to cooperate, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is ultimately more beneficial. Cooperation is the best way to teach children to become responsible and successful adults.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.; Speaking task: It is sometimes said that a child should be taught to compete, but I believe that the child should be taught to co-operate. Co-operation is the key to developing a number of essential social skills such as communication, listening, empathy and problem solving. Moreover, the sense of community and mutual respect that children learn from co-operation is a good foundation for their future life. Lastly, when children work together for a common goal, they learn to understand and respect each other’s weaknesses and strengths, and this is a good preparation for the working environment where harmony and cooperation are the most important skills. Children are taught to compete, but the disadvantage of competition is that it can create a selfish, unhealthy attitude to success and failure. This attitude can result in stress, anxiety and lowered self-esteem when children fail. The advantages of teaching children to co-operate are that they will become more confident and well-balanced people, and they will be able to deal with the complexities of the world, build strong relationships and make a positive contribution to society. In conclusion, while there are some advantages to teaching children to compete, I believe that co-operation has more advantages. Moreover, teaching children to co-operate is essential for raising a new generation of people who are compassionate, willing to help each other and successful in their own right.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.; Cooperation and competition are two aspects of childhood that teachers and parents have long argued about. While some argue that children need to compete in the future, I think teaching them cooperation can make them useful adults. Teaching children to cooperate can make them develop their social skills such as communication, understanding, empathy and problem-solving. Cooperation can also foster the spirit of sharing and respect for each other, which is very important in building strong relationships. In addition, children cooperate and have common goals, and they know each other's strengths and weaknesses, and they will become a better team, which is of great value in the real world. However, teaching children to compete can lead to an unhealthy attitude towards individuality, which can lead to their success at the expense of others, and competition can lead to anxiety, stress and lowered self-esteem when they encounter failures. Cooperation can make children mature and become more useful adults. When they go out into the real world, they will have more skills to build relationships, help each other, and be more unified in the face of the complexity of their environment. In short, teaching children to cooperate is the best way to raise a generation of people who are kind, united and successful.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.; Discuss. To what extent do you think a child should be taught to compete or cooperate? This question has caused a great debate among educators and parents. There are many arguments for teaching a child to compete, which is necessary for his future success. But I firmly believe that children should be taught to cooperate. Teaching cooperation develops children's ability to communicate, and the ability to sympathize and solve problems. Co-operation also develops a sense of community and mutual respect, which is necessary for the development of the relationship between children. It also prepares children for the real world, where teamwork and teamwork are highly valued. Cooperation also creates an environment where children are not forced to compete, so they are not under constant pressure to achieve success. On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to a selfish attitude, an obsession with success, stress and low self-esteem when they fail. Cooperation creates more mature, empathetic and productive people, who are able to cope with the difficulties of life, and build strong relationships, and work together to achieve a goal. Cooperation and competition have both their advantages and disadvantages, but I think that teaching children to cooperate will have a longer-term positive effect on children. Children who are taught to cooperate grow up to be compassionate, cooperative and successful.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.; Discuss your view. Recent debates about the best ways of raising children, to make them independent and self-reliant or to teach them to work together, have created a lot of discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete with each other is necessary for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in helping them to become decent human beings. Working together also creates a sense of community and mutual respect, which are important in building strong and lasting relationships. When children work together they learn to respect each other’s talents and abilities, which makes them better prepared for the workplace, where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. On the other hand, too much competition can result in unhealthy obsessions with winning, which can lead to stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem when they fail. By learning to work together and share ideas, children will become well-rounded, productive and cooperative adults. In the real world, this will make them better prepared to work with others, to collaborate with their peers, and to contribute to their communities. In conclusion, while there are some benefits to teaching children to compete, I believe that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. In the final analysis, the ability to work together is the foundation for raising a compassionate, cooperative and successful generation.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.; And why? Whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate has always been a subject of heated debate among parents and educators. I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial to their development as useful adults. Cooperation also strengthens the sense of community and mutual respect, which are essential to the establishment of a lasting friendship. It also provides a foundation for a future life of work, where the most effective approach is teamwork. To emphasise competition, instead of cooperation, only encourages children to think of themselves and their personal success at the expense of others. Then they will become too obsessed with winning and lose their self-confidence when they encounter failures. Cooperation is the key to developing a well-rounded, useful, and sensitive adult. In their later life, they will be better able to build strong relationships, work together in harmony and benefit their community. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, teaching children to cooperate is more beneficial in the long run. Cooperation is the way to create a generation of sensitive, caring and successful people.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.; The question of whether it is better to teach children to compete or co-operate has aroused intense discussion among educators and parents. While some people argue that teaching children to compete is essential to their future success, I think that teaching children to co-operate is a better way to help them grow up to be useful and responsible adults. Co-operation teaches children to respect each other’s skills and abilities, which makes it easier for them to work as a team when they become adults. Moreover, co-operation encourages a sense of community and responsibility, which makes it easier for them to establish long-lasting relationships. Besides, competition can lead to an unhealthy obsession with winning at any cost, which can cause stress, anxiety and a lack of self-esteem. In my opinion, children who learn to co-operate, share their ideas and help each other grow into adults who are more confident, more able to deal with adversity and more able to live in harmony with others. In conclusion, although competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is a better way to help them grow up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.; I strongly believe that the more children learn to work together, the more they learn to work together. Cooperation develops children's social skills, such as communication, sympathy, and problem-solving. A debate has been going on for a long time between educators and parents, whether children should be taught to compete or to work together. Cooperative learning builds trust and respect, which is important for children to build good relationships with each other. It also prepares children for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, too much emphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment where children feel under pressure to win at all costs, and this destroys the value of fair play and good sportsmanship. On the other hand, children who are taught to compete often become selfish and greedy and value their own success over the success of others. This can lead to unhealthy competition and stress, and the result is that they lose self-esteem and feel lonely and miserable when they fail. Cooperation makes children mature, empathetic, and cooperative, and they can better navigate the complexities of the real world and make positive contributions to society. In conclusion, although competition also has its benefits, I still think that teaching children to work together is more beneficial in the long run. In the end, we must teach children to work together, and help them grow up to be compassionate, empathetic, cooperative, and successful.
