0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.; Competition can be a good thing in children. Competition can make children ambitious and determined. Both of these things are important, but I argue that it is more important to develop co-operation in children, which will create well-rounded and helpful adults for a more interconnected world. Children who are only concerned with outdoing their peers may miss the key opportunities for personal development which can come from learning to share their ideas and listen to others. However, an excessive emphasis on competition can lead to the opposite of this: anxiety, unhealthy rivalry and the inability to work together effectively. Cooperation fosters social and emotional skills which are becoming increasingly important in our interdependent society. Co-operation also develops social skills such as empathy, communication and conflict resolution. These skills are crucial not only in social situations, but also in the workplace, where teamwork is essential for success. Cooperation also promotes a sense of community and belonging, which are essential for emotional well-being. By encouraging children to work well with others, we are preparing them for a world that increasingly relies on co-operation and shared effort. In conclusion, while competition can be a positive force for personal achievement, emphasising co-operation is a more sustainable way of developing responsible adults.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.; I think that it is very important for the immigrants to be able to assimilate into their adopted country, but to abandon their old ways is not necessarily a good idea. A moderate view is the most desirable, both for the individual and for society. I would like to mention some advantages of this moderation. Firstly, cultural exchange is enriching for the whole society. Second, it gives new opportunities for education. Third, there are difficulties for the immigrant, such as homesickness and discrimination. Finally, if he is under pressure to reject his past, he will feel frustrated. But it is important for practical reasons, for communication and cohesion, to adopt local customs. By allowing them to keep some of their old ways, but to adapt to local customs, the new society can offer them the feeling of acceptance. In conclusion, I would like to say that I think the need to assimilate into their new country should not lead to the complete rejection of their past. Learning the language, understanding the social codes, respecting local traditions can facilitate assimilation and relationships with the new society. Keeping some old ways, but adopting local customs can enrich the new society and help the whole country to become stronger.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.; Why do you think so? Is there any positive and negative aspect of this phenomenon? You can write about both the advantages and disadvantages. It is a common thing for international tourists to bring with them a variety of customs, traditions, and views. It is a great opportunity for local residents to communicate with different people, which not only enriches the life of the local residents, but also brings a greater understanding of tolerance to people from different countries. In addition, international tourism is a major engine of economic development. There are many countries that depend on tourism for their main source of income, which can bring in billions of dollars annually. Besides, there are also some negative phenomena in the development of international tourism. Opponents of international tourism often point to the destruction of the natural environment, the overcrowding of tourist cities, and the commodification of local cultures. The increase in tourists can also create a large number of jobs in the catering industry, transport, and trade, which will help improve the unemployment rate of the local residents. The construction of roads, airports, and tourist buildings will benefit both tourists and local residents. In conclusion, although there are some problems in the development of international tourism, they cannot be ignored, and their positive effects on intercultural communication and economic development cannot be ignored. However, the negative phenomena of international tourism can be solved by the implementation of the scientific and reasonable management of sustainable development. International tourism can promote intercultural understanding and economic development in the world.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.; In my opinion, the benefits of international tourism outweigh the disadvantages, as it creates opportunities for cultural exchange, economic development and a global understanding. In the past few years, international tourism has experienced a phenomenal growth, becoming more common than ever before. This growth has brought with it both positive and negative trends, which have caused a lively debate on the impact of international tourism on both national and local economies. Many countries, especially those with a rich cultural and natural heritage, such as Thailand, Italy or Costa Rica, have depended on international tourism to maintain their economy. The most significant benefit of international tourism is that it boosts the economy of host countries. It brings in revenue, creates jobs and encourages economic growth. Local businesses are given an opportunity to thrive and local craftsmen are able to compete in the market. As a result, there is an increase in foreign currency, which enables the government to improve its public services and maintain its social development. It also enriches the cultural exchange between different countries, broadening the horizons of individuals and encouraging them to become more tolerant and respectable of others. The dangers of mass tourism must also be considered, such as the over-exploitation of natural resources and the negative impact on local economies. In a time when many people are wary of globalization, tourism acts as a bridge between people from different backgrounds. The increased understanding between countries, fostered by international tourism, plays a vital role in our increasingly interconnected world. To counteract the disadvantages of international tourism, responsible tourism is important. With a focus on sustainable practices and responsible tourism, we can continue to benefit from the positives and avoid the negatives.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.; The biggest challenge for a student is to adapt to a different culture. While it is true that studying abroad can have its advantages, I would argue that the difficulties a student faces in adjusting to a new culture can outweigh these advantages, making it preferable for many students to stay at home. The difficulties a student faces can result in a sense of loneliness and homesickness, which can negatively affect both the academic and personal development of the student. Furthermore, the financial burden of studying abroad is considerable, with the cost of tuition and living expenses being considerably higher for international students than for domestic students. This can result in a sense of financial stress that, for many families, is an obstacle to the quality of a student’s education, as the student’s mind is diverted from his studies and his overall university experience becomes diminished. In contrast, local universities can offer a quality education and offer a valuable network of professional contacts that can lead to good employment prospects without the added burden of a difficult transition to a new culture. Staying at home can also have the advantage of familiarity and support. Being near family and friends can provide the emotional stability necessary for a student to deal with the stress of transitioning to university life. Ultimately, the decision should be made on the basis of each student’s personal circumstances and goals. In summary, although the prospect of studying abroad can be an exciting prospect and a wonderful opportunity for personal growth, the difficulties in adjusting to a new culture, financial burden, and emotional support can make it preferable for many students to stay at home.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.; In my opinion, one of the main reasons why people study abroad is the chance to learn about other cultures. There are many reasons why students study abroad, and the decision to study outside one's home country has a number of personal, academic, and professional advantages. The student not only develops his personality by living in a different country, but he also develops skills that are useful for life. For example, the ability to live in a foreign country requires a good communication and problem-solving skill, which is very important in today's interconnected world. For example, a student from a developing country can enhance his technical and professional qualifications by studying in a country known for its achievements in science and technology, which can enhance his academic credentials and employment prospects. Secondly, some students are looking for a better quality of education and specialized programs that are not available in their own country. For example, foreign institutions often have world-famous academic programs, world-class facilities, and world-class teachers. In addition, the study abroad is an opportunity to establish good relationships with peers, teachers, and businessmen from different countries, which can lead to internships and jobs in the future. These international networks are also very important in the increasingly globalized job market, and employers are beginning to require their employees to have cross-cultural skills. Studying abroad can be a valuable life experience for a student, which helps him become more independent and mature. The other important reason why people want to study abroad is to develop personally. These experiences not only enrich their education, but also help students acquire important skills and perspectives for their future work, making an international educational experience invaluable. In conclusion, there are many reasons why students want to study abroad, including learning about different cultures, seeking a better education, establishing relationships with others, and personal growth.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole."; It is clear that digital media have become very popular. However, arguing that newspapers will become extinct is not accurate. On the one hand, the news on the Internet is easily accessible and the time is short. On the other hand, there are many questions that need to be asked in order to see that newspapers will become extinct. The Internet news on the Internet is an advantage, especially for younger people who have the habit of getting news and information at once. Furthermore, the Internet news on the Internet is very interactive, especially with videos, comments and social networks, which are more reader-friendly. Nevertheless, it is essential to mention the characteristics of newspapers that continue to be useful. For many people, newspapers offer a sense of reliability and credibility that is sometimes not found on the Internet. Newspapers also play an important role in local communities. Local journalism, often through print media, provides important local coverage of issues that residents care about. It is therefore too easy to say that the newspaper will become extinct. Although the Internet has a big impact on how news is distributed and consumed, it is too easy to say that newspapers will become extinct. The Internet news often focuses on general issues and sensations, while local news can be seen as an indispensable link to local accountability.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future."; Firstly, the first years of a child's life are the most important in his intellectual, emotional and social development. Secondly, educating young children has long-term benefits, not only for the individual, but also for the development of the whole society. In particular, by improving literacy and numeracy, the quality of secondary education and the quality of the workforce, the government can achieve its goals. It is well known that early childhood education improves children's later results. Thirdly, if governments are willing to use money to eradicate education gaps early, it can save money on remedial work later. Moreover, early education is often more cost-effective than higher education. Fourthly, although a focus on early childhood education is necessary, it would be more effective to combine the two. However, the role of higher education should not be underestimated. Universities play an important role in the development of knowledge and skills that are needed for innovation and leadership in different fields. Fifthly, although the long-term benefits of a focus on early childhood education may be considerable, it is still important to invest in universities, so that people are better prepared to achieve sustainable development. The government should allocate some of its budget to early childhood education and to universities, to ensure a comprehensive and continuous education system for citizens at all levels.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society."; For many students, the quality of their roommate can greatly influence their success in the classroom, and also their overall well-being. That’s why it’s important to understand the key qualities that will lead to a successful roommate relationship. First of all, it’s important that a roommate respects the other person. Each person comes from a different background, and has a different way of living and working. If, for example, one roommate needs silence to study, and the other loves to listen to music, they should be able to reach a compromise. For example, one of them could use headphones or set “quiet hours” to avoid problems. Mutual respect helps to make the relationship a pleasant one, and minimizes the possibility of conflict. If, for example, one roommate is overwhelmed with schoolwork or has a difficult home situation, a good roommate will create a safe place for the other to share those feelings. Finally, good communication is an important quality. Open lines of communication help to avoid misunderstandings and bring harmony. And, of course, a good relationship requires shared responsibilities. Frequent check-ins can help to resolve conflicts before they escalate, and help each roommate feel heard and valued. The best way to share responsibilities is to establish a consistent schedule for tasks such as cleaning, shopping, and paying bills. If, for example, one roommate always takes out the garbage and the other always washes the dishes, each person contributes equally to maintaining a pleasant and practical living environment. Failure to share responsibilities can lead to resentment and conflict, which can undermine the success of both people. Respect, good communication, and shared responsibilities are essential qualities of a good roommate. Together, these qualities help to create a supportive environment in which each person can thrive both academically and personally.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.; ... Though both public and private transportation are necessary to a functioning society, I believe that governments should allocate more funds to public transportation. Public transportation has several advantages over other types of transportation. There are many reasons why governments should support public transportation. First, public transportation provides an alternative means of transport for people who don't have a car, which would result in a reduction of cars on the road. As cities grow, so does the number of cars, which causes a lot of traffic and reduces people's journey times. Second, public transportation is more environmentally friendly. When you invest in public transportation, you can make more people use it, which means less pollution and fewer cars on the road. Also, if public transportation is developed, it will be fairer. Public transport, especially buses, is an important means of access for low-income people to work, education and essential services. If the public transport system works well, there will be fewer greenhouse gas emissions and fewer toxic substances in the atmosphere. In conclusion, although both road and public transportation need to be improved, public transportation should be the focus. The reduction in traffic congestion, the reduction in pollution and the improvement in equality will benefit everyone. .
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students."; A physical education should be an essential part of every school day. I am sure that students need to have a good physical health, mental health and, as a result, their academic performance will also be good. In addition, students learn a long-term lifestyle through the sport, yoga or exercise they do at school, and this creates an opportunity for them to continue their healthy lifestyles into adulthood. In the era of modern society where sedentary habits are becoming more and more common, regular physical exercise can reduce the problem of obesity and associated health issues. In addition, the brain releases endorphins when exercising, which can reduce stress and improve concentration. According to a study by the American College of Sports Medicine, the effect of physical exercise on mood, anxiety, and brain function has been confirmed in many studies. This has a positive effect on the students' academic performance, as they are able to focus more on the academic studies and are more able to learn and study. Therefore, a balanced lifestyle that includes physical exercise complements academic learning. Finally, I believe that physical education should be included in the curriculum. Sports teach the importance of discipline, persistence and the value of teamwork, and they can be an important tool for students to face higher education and future careers. Physical education and academic learning should go hand in hand, preparing students for lifelong success.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.; On the technological innovations, the Internet is an important transformational force. It has profoundly changed the way in which nations communicate, trade, and conduct diplomacy. This new technology has opened up the possibilities of trans-global communication. Nations are no longer isolated. They can now communicate and negotiate with each other regardless of location or time zone. This immediacy is essential in the face-paced world in which we live. In addition, the Internet has revolutionized world trade. Using e-commerce platforms, small businesses in developing countries can now access international markets. Moreover, the Internet has made virtual summits and international conferences possible. In this way, the leaders of the world can rapidly and efficiently resolve pressing issues such as the climate change and health crises. In addition, social media have reshaped diplomacy. The Internet has made cooperation and competition possible, which has sparked innovation and led to better choices for consumers. So, the Internet is an essential tool of modern diplomacy. Public opinion is now important. Leaders use the social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, to communicate directly with citizens and international publics. This communication can be positive or negative, depending on the circumstances and public opinion. And, with the further development of technology, the Internet will continue to be an important tool of diplomacy, a reflection of the changing nature of interdependence.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.; To begin with, technology offers children many tools and resources that would have been impossible in the past. But it is my view that technology has not made children less creative, but has radically changed how they express it. Children are now able to combine music, storytelling and art in new ways and easily share it with the world, thus producing an original, new form of self-expression that did not exist in the past. In addition, social media, digital film and art programs are a perfect medium for creative expression, such as, for example, a digital music player like Bossa and Neffos and a program like Audacity, which helps to create original forms of music, such as the project Moecanoe. These are the beginnings of creativity, which many educational applications and platforms provide. In addition, interactive games and creative programs that encourage children to explore and experiment with the world are the starting point for creativity. Children can experience different cultures and ideas in the space that fosters creativity. On the other hand, one must recognize that the dependence of children on technology can lead to a passive consumption of creativity, rather than an active involvement. Coding programs, for example, not only teach children logical thinking, but also create a space where they can create their own games, animations and applications. Creativity and technology are a starting point for a new generation of inventors and thinkers. In conclusion, rather than decreasing creativity, technology has increased and reshaped it. The challenge is to find the right balance between childhood and technology. In addition, too much time on the screens can divert attention from other forms of creativity that are rooted in the body, such as drawing, building or playing outside. However, by using these tools wisely, parents and educators can foster creativity and thus prepare children for an increasingly digital world.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?; Teachers provide a wealth of personal experience and knowledge that is unmatched by other static resources. In this respect, I believe that while these sources can provide useful supplementary information, the lessons with the teacher offer unique advantages that are indispensable for a complete education. Teachers can adjust their teaching styles to suit the different learning preferences of their students, while the information on the Internet is often presented in a one-size-fits-all way that may not be useful for everyone. In addition, the learning environment that the teacher creates allows the students to actively engage with the material and thus helps them to understand the subject. If videos and articles are informative, they generally lack the interactivity that promotes deeper learning. Group discussions, projects and experiments encourage students to ask questions and ask for more information, as well as developing vital skills like teamwork, communication and problem solving. Furthermore, teachers are also mentors and role models who can support and guide the students emotionally and thus significantly affect their motivation and self-esteem. So I strongly believe that lessons with teachers are paramount to education. Although these other sources can be very useful for providing additional information, I do not think they can replace the invaluable educational experience that the teacher can provide.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;" If these modes of communication present challenges to established linguistic norms, then there is a need for a more careful examination of the broader implications of the above statement. For instance, the ease of texting has led many people to develop a reliance on shorthand expressions, which can affect the literacy of the younger generations still learning to write in the old fashioned way. This shift has fundamentally altered the ways in which people use language, often promoting a more casual style that can seriously compromise grammatical accuracy and precision. In addition, the immediacy of these new forms of communication enables the kind of direct and immediate engagement that is not always possible with traditional forms of writing. On the other hand, some people have argued that new forms of writing that have emerged, such as the meme, the gif, and the visual narrative, can represent a dynamic linguistic evolution. Not only that, but many people still write in formal styles when required to do so, indicating that the written language has not been totally compromised. In conclusion, email and texting have presented opportunities for language evolution and diversification; while they have altered the contexts in which written language is used, they have also stimulated a fresh interest in language with their creative formats. Rather than seeing them as serious threats to our written communication, we should see them as opportunities for re-inventing the way we communicate."
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits."; The exploitation of animals for human needs, primarily for research, agriculture and entertainment, has always been a controversial issue. Some believe that animal testing has saved many lives and contributed to medical development. The same people believe that animals have a moral status inferior to that of humans and that the use of animals for the benefit of human society is acceptable. On the other hand, there are many arguments against the exploitation of animals, the most important of which is a moral and ethical point of view. This view argues that, throughout history, domesticating animals for food and work has been essential for the survival and development of mankind. However, there have also been several movements and campaigns advocating the vegetarian and then the total renunciation of animal food, which show that there has been a strong movement in society towards the rights of animals. Opponents of animal use claim that such use violates the rights of sentient beings who are able to feel pain and suffering. It is therefore necessary to minimize the use of animals and pay particular attention to the humane treatment of animals. In my opinion, some use of animals for the benefit of mankind may be necessary and useful, but it is necessary to be done in an ethical and strict manner. The benefits of medicine and science should not come at the expense of the animal. However, it is necessary to strike a balance and not exploit it.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.; I agree that the excessive use of the television can be detrimental to family and friends, but I disagree that it has destroyed the communication. Although the television is considered to be an important part of life and a source of news and entertainment, the claim that it has destroyed communication between friends and family should be carefully examined. For example, by watching popular series, friends and family may find a common point of view, and discussions about the story, characters and morals lead to deeper conversations that strengthen ties and ties. First, it can serve as a platform for communication. On the other hand, the program and the documentary often discuss important social issues, such as climate change, mental health, and social justice. During such discussions, the family members express their personal thoughts, feelings, and points of view, and thus create a richer environment for communication. On the other hand, excessive use of the television can lead to the isolation of individuals, which may weaken the communication between friends and family. Instead of destroying communication, the television can be a catalyst for meaningful conversations. To conclude, although the use of the television can lead to communication and discourage conversation, the lack of communication and lack of communication are the result of the lack of balance and proportionality rather than a fault of the medium. Families and friends have the power to set the boundaries of the screen and to prevent the use of the television from invading the family and friends' time. Instead of being a destroyer of communication, it can be a tool that, when used in moderation, can enrich the relationship between family and friends.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.; But the idea that universities should accept equal numbers of men and women in all subjects deserves a close examination. Although gender equality is desirable, such a policy of quotas could affect the essential values of academic merit and individual choice. Universities could, however, try to maintain the proportions of women and men that are accepted by demanding more balanced admissions. On the one hand, by promoting equal opportunities, they can break the traditional stereotypes of women and men in those subjects where one is more pronounced. For example, in engineering and technology, men have been traditionally dominant, while women have been attracted to nursing and teaching. Students should ideally be accepted based on their skills and achievements, not on their gender. It is desirable that a balanced gender ratio also corresponds to society's desire to achieve equality in the world, enabling women to shine in the fields where they have been underrepresented. But quotas ignore the complexity of individual choices and the variety of student aspirations, resulting in an atmosphere of academic competition and creating a negative effect. Adopting the equal number of men and women will inevitably harm the most talented and ambitious students, thereby harming the quality of education. To protect the interests of individuals and society, it would be better to provide equal opportunities and support programs, such as scholarships and community services, to strengthen gender equality.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.; The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a transitional period for young people, a time of great choices. Among these choices is the question of whether or not to seek independence from the family as soon as possible. I think that the young people who make this choice will be better off when they want to be independent as soon as possible. It gives them more self-confidence and more control over their lives. When young people are left to themselves and have to take responsibility for themselves, they develop key life skills, such as the ability to deal with money and to solve problems. Furthermore, they learn to be responsible. When young adults are responsible for their living space, they learn to deal with the bills and to take care of the household. Living independently means adjusting to new challenges and experiencing the development of a more personal identity and a more mature way of thinking. Living at home can also lead to a lingering immaturity and excessive reliance on family for emotional and material support. In contrast, when young people live at home, they often remain immature and depend on their family for emotional and material support. A greater sense of responsibility and self-reliance can be of great value to both the personal and the professional. As a result, young people should strive to take advantage of the benefits of independence, which are the personal development, responsibility and maturity that are gained. This can prevent the development of life skills, which may inhibit the transition to adulthood.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.; I believe that the government must take the lead, but private individuals and companies must also share the responsibility. The issue of who should be responsible for the environment is becoming more and more important with the problems of climate change and pollution. First of all, governments have the regulatory framework, the resources and the power to launch large-scale conservation projects. They have the power to allocate public money for projects to restore natural resources, reduce emissions and promote sustainable development. Second, governments have the power to impose rules and regulations on companies, so they must reduce their ecological footprint. Companies, especially those in resource-intensive industries, can have a significant effect on the environment. Using government regulations alone is not enough. However, companies must also take a more active role in reducing their own footprint. By adopting cleaner production methods, reducing waste and developing sustainable supply chains, they can create a culture of conservation. In the same way, individuals have a crucial role to play. When individuals adopt sustainable habits, such as reducing water wastage, reusing products and using public transport, they contribute to a collective effort to tackle the problem. Public awareness campaigns can encourage others to take action. Grassroots and community-based initiatives can have a big effect. These kinds of individual efforts are important for a collective approach to effective conservation and sustainable development. In conclusion, although the government has the power to impose rules and regulations and allocate public money for conservation projects, private companies and individuals have an equally important role to play. If all parties work together, it is possible to meet the challenges of the modern world.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.; I strongly agree that good advertisement strategies play an important role in high sales, but I also think that there are other factors at play. In the modern market, advertising plays an important role in influencing consumers and driving sales. But, while successful marketing can make a product more visible and attractive, it is not the only factor influencing sales. For example, some companies, such as Nike and Apple, have used marketing to their advantage, creating emotional connections with their consumers and using storytelling to influence their brand image. A good advertising strategy can create a strong brand identity and attract the attention of consumers. However, in the end, it is the product itself that can make a big difference. If a product isn’t what the consumer wants, then even the best marketing campaign won’t sustain high sales. Then, too, price and availability are important factors. The quality of the product and its price play an important role in influencing the consumers’ loyalty and repeat purchases. Good marketing strategies, which encompass quality, price and distribution, are crucial to long-term success in a highly competitive marketplace. In conclusion, while good marketing is important to high sales, it is only one of many factors at play. A good balance of all these elements is necessary for success.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges."; The question of whether it is useful for a country's young people to go to university has recently received a great deal of attention. The debate about whether it is beneficial for a country to have a high percentage of young people going to university has attracted great attention. The fact that there is a great increase in university attendance is a large number of young people, while a number of professions are limited in terms of employment. Universities often function as incubators of innovation and innovation, where students are engaged in research and entrepreneurship, which can have great economic value. The situation not only leads to higher unemployment among young people, but also to the question of the return on investment for the individual who has a high student loan and not in proportion to the expected employment a larger one. In particular, this is so in the areas where the labor market cannot absorb the increasing number of students, whereby many graduates are underemployed or have jobs that do not require a university degree. In my opinion, while it is useful for a country to have a high percentage of young people going to university, it is necessary to seek a balance between different career paths and academic careers. It is also important that we do not focus on vocational training and apprenticeships, which are also essential to a diverse economy. When countries take advantage of the potential of their youth in this way, they avoid the dangers of unemployment and underemployment.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.; SOCIAL IMPACTS Mobile phones contribute to the decline in personal communication. There are serious social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. In addition, mobile phones can be a tool for cyberbullying and contribute to mental health issues, especially among younger users who feel the pressure of social media. The decline in communication and social skills that result from people being absorbed in their mobile phones leads to a decline in the quality of relationships. As for the medical side, excessive use of mobile phones can have an impact on the quality of life of users. For example, looking down at the screen for too long can lead to the development of the so-called text neck and insomnia due to the bluish glow of the screens. Finally, it is a technical problem that increased reliance on mobile phones has led to the question of the security and privacy of mobile phone users. Due to the vast amount of personal data stored on smart phones, they are at risk of becoming a target of cyber attacks, which can lead to identity theft and the leakage of sensitive data. Finally, there is a debate about the long-term effects of radiation from mobile phones, but there are no final conclusions. Taking into account the advantages and disadvantages of mobile phone use, it is clear that mobile phones can improve communication, ease of use and access to information, but they also bring social, medical and technical problems that cannot be ignored. The goal of this is to balance the benefits and disadvantages of mobile phone use for a healthier and more cohesive society. In the end, the disadvantages of mobile phone use can be managed with responsible use and greater awareness.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.; This is the first essay for this task. Firstly, too much computer use can lead to many health problems. In this digital era, the ubiquity of the computer is not only in adults but also in children. Children who are addicted to the screen have a higher risk of becoming obese because of their sedentary lifestyle. Besides that, they also often have bad posture, eye fatigue and sleep disorders. All of these conditions can have a negative impact on their development and health. Then, in terms of social relationships, the use of computers every day can have a very bad effect on children. In general, children who spend a lot of time on the Internet have fewer face-to-face interactions with their peers. This can affect their ability to socialize and reduce their emotional intelligence. Furthermore, the access to inappropriate material on the Internet is a big problem for children. On the Internet, there are many content that is not suitable for children, ranging from violent images to cyberbullying. This isolation from real relationships will have a negative effect on the ability to communicate and build relationships in the future. It is also true that the use of the Internet can be used for education and skills development. But these benefits can also be obtained in a limited and controlled way. Without proper supervision, children can access inappropriate material and have a negative impact on their mental health and worldview. It is therefore very important for parents to set limits on their children's use of computers and encourage other developmentally beneficial activities for balanced development. In conclusion, although there are many benefits to the use of computers, the disadvantages of daily use are much more pronounced.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.; The advantages are many. On the one hand, industrial development often leads to increased economic prosperity. On the other hand, the factory creates new job opportunities from production workers to supervisors, which decreases unemployment. Also, factories often contribute to the development of local public transport and roads, which also improves the quality of life. These advantages are balanced by some disadvantages that can affect community welfare. The main disadvantage is the negative impact on the environment. Factories lead to increased air and water pollution, which threatens public health and harms the environment. Also, noise pollution from machinery affects the tranquility of the local community and can lead to increased anxiety and lower property values. A large factory can also be a source of division between community members. Some people benefit from the new jobs, while others are left behind and not sharing the benefits. Finally, the rapid industrialization of the area puts a strain on local natural resources such as water and energy, which can lead to conflicts over the use of these resources. In order to counteract these disadvantages, a careful and balanced approach is required, involving a strong community involvement and sustainable practices. In conclusion, a large factory near a community can bring economic benefits and development, but it can also lead to social problems, such as pollution and social unrest.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.; This task asks important questions about the impact on health, culture and lifestyle. Recent advances in technology and changes in social standards have made it easier to prepare food. For busy people and families, the ease of preparing food means that they can eat healthy meals without having to plan or shop. On the one hand, the easy preparation of food democratizes cooking, making it possible for people of varying abilities to cook. On the other hand, the easy preparation of food has some disadvantages. Many pre-prepared foods are high in salt, preservatives and unhealthy fats, which could have negative effects on health over time. This means that families might choose to prepare meals at home rather than go to fast food restaurants. Cooking is not only a practical skill, but also a cultural habit, which nourishes creativity, family bonding and the enjoyment of different cuisines. Easier preparation can lead to the loss of knowledge and skills, especially in the younger generations. To promote a healthy future, we need to understand the relationship between food and quality of life. In conclusion, while the easy preparation of food can make for healthier choices and a more relaxed lifestyle, it is essential to combine the convenience of easy preparation with the cultural appreciation of cooking.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.; Finance can of course provide a quick solution, and is important for education, health and development. Nevertheless, while finance plays a critical role in the development of poor countries, it is not a complete solution. Only relying on financial aid has significant disadvantages. For example, the aid of poor countries has often been the only hope for survival in the aftermath of natural disasters or epidemics. Besides that, not all aid is effective because of mismanagement, corruption and lack of focus on the root causes of poverty. Often, the cycle of dependence on foreign aid discourages local creativity and entrepreneurship. Through strengthening the economy and local institutions, developing countries can develop self-sufficiency and reduce their dependence on foreign aid. The more balanced approach to development assistance combines financial assistance with capacity building, technology transfer and trade openings. Therefore, I partly agree with the statement that financial aid is necessary but should be combined with other measures to truly help developing countries. In conclusion, while financial aid is an important tool for assisting poor countries, it is not the only one. A multi-pronged approach, combining finance with other types of assistance such as education, government policy and building a better transport system, is needed to create a long-term solution.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.; This question is an important and controversial one. It is argued that the ban on advertising is not only impractical, but also detrimental to the useful role of advertising in society. Advertisements inform consumers about new products, compare the quality of goods and services, and encourage competition between brands, thus improving the quality of goods and lowering prices. First of all, advertising is very useful for consumers. Advertisements, especially those that encourage children to consume unhealthy food, can lead to many negative outcomes in society, such as poor health and the formation of unhealthy body images. However, it is undeniable that advertising can have some negative consequences. Keeping the public informed about the goods they consume, advertising plays a significant role and should not be ignored. Instead of banning advertising completely, governments should enforce stricter regulations in order to avoid the harmful consequences and take advantage of the benefits. Some people may be influenced by the emotional appeals in advertising, which may lead to impulse buying and consumerism, which is often incompatible with more sustainable values. Adopting a framework that encourages responsible advertising and a healthy market for consumers, society should take advantage of the benefits of the marketplace, while reducing the negative impact. In conclusion, although there are some concerns about the quality and impact of advertisements, it is not right to neglect the indispensable role of advertisements in modern trade.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.; The historical view is that women were kept at home and they had to look after the family. However, in the contemporary world, a woman has a number of opportunities that she could not access in the past. This is very important because it not only gives women an opportunity to be financially independent but also allows families to have a dual income that will help them to achieve financial security. In addition, the presence of women in various industries inspires future generations and leads them to make their own choices without any discrimination. For example, many women are able to juggle two roles, thereby demonstrating their resilience and multiple talents. On the other hand, the belief that women should primarily care for the family is a cultural expectation that continues to exist in many communities. Women's choice is a unique path, and the emphasis should be on the individual, the opportunity to take it, and the progress of the community. To sum up, this debate is not about whether a woman should work or care for the household but about whether she has the right to make a choice that suits her life and aspirations. If equal opportunities are available to women, it will allow them to develop in both professional and domestic settings, which will ultimately create a more balanced and progressive society.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them."; A: I agree with both sides and I agree that students or their parents should pay for university education. A: In general, primary and secondary education is a basic right and a cornerstone of social progress. B: In contrast, university education, although important, is more of a personal advantage, bringing the opportunity to have a higher income and to some extent to afford the costs of higher education. Primary and secondary education is needed to educate civilized citizens and to level the playing field. Furthermore, the fact that university students or their parents pay can enhance the value of university education. When a person has invested his money, whether it is tuition or living expenses, he will be more serious and responsible about his studies. A: On the other hand, there are some social considerations. For example, some students will not be able to afford higher education, which will deepen the gap between the rich and the poor. Teaching responsibility and money management will teach them life lessons. In conclusion, although the government must definitely pay for primary and secondary education, the reasonable division of costs between the government and university students or their parents would make university education more prestigious and serious. The university can help them pay for the costs of education and there should be a reasonable system of scholarships and student loans.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.; I largely agree that the use of alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and that international laws should be introduced to control car ownership and use. Since the first car was registered in Britain in 1888, a remarkable transformation has taken place in transport. It is now common knowledge that the internal combustion engine is responsible for releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has been the main cause of the greenhouse effect and global warming. In the first place, the over-use of cars contributes significantly to the pollution of the environment. Also, there are certain socio-economic disadvantages connected with the use of cars. In many urban areas, the ownership of a car is associated with wealth and leads to inequalities of access to jobs and other resources. By putting in place more extensive cycle paths and improving the availability and reliability of public transport, we could reduce our dependence on cars and so help to improve our health. Despite the fact that for some people the convenience and even necessity of the car cannot be denied, it is important to strike a balance between the needs of those individuals and the wider responsibilities to society and the environment. The introduction of international regulations governing the ownership of cars could, for example, involve the introduction of stricter emission standards, a cap on the number of vehicles that can be registered, and a system of financial incentives for individuals to use alternative forms of transport. All these measures would promote a more equitable transport environment and so encourage a cultural shift towards more sustainable practices. Ultimately, the encouragement of alternative forms of transport and the introduction of such regulations are essential if our transport system is to be sustainable.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live."; I agree that wealthy countries have a moral obligation to help poor ones. There are three reasons for this view: ethical reasons, economic interdependence and the necessity of preserving world peace. The first reason is that many poor countries suffer from a number of problems such as lack of health care, poor education and a lack of basic facilities. Through their financial help, wealthy countries can contribute to their sustainable development to reduce poverty and increase access to basic services. The second reason is that the world economy is now becoming increasingly interconnected, and the stability of wealthy countries depends on the prosperity of poorer ones. The assistance provided to poor countries not only helps individuals but also creates a fairer world. In addition, the issues of global warming and the threat of epidemics demonstrate the urgency of international cooperation. By investing in the development of poor countries, wealthy countries can increase their economic growth and find new markets for their products, so they will benefit both parties. In conclusion, the help provided by wealthy countries to poor ones is a necessary step towards achieving global equality, improving international relations and ensuring a sustainable future. If rich countries do not provide financial assistance, the problems of global warming and epidemics will be difficult to solve, and these problems will lead to even more inequality and a greater risk for all countries. Help should not only aim at alleviating immediate suffering but also contribute to a country's long-term self-reliance.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them."; At first glance, the effects of globalization seem to be a very positive one, but when one looks deeper, one realizes that the effects are both positive and negative. It facilitates international trade, increases competition and creates job opportunities, especially for people in developing countries. I am told that by allowing countries to specialize in their comparative advantage, it increases efficiency and productivity. For example, countries rich in natural resources can export their natural resources and import technology and manufactured goods from more developed countries. The most obvious negative effect of this increase in interdependence between countries is that it increases the inequality between countries and within countries. The interdependence of countries leads to economic growth, job creation and an improvement in the living conditions of many. There are also concerns that the race to the bottom in terms of labour and working conditions can lead to exploitation of cheaper labour and lax regulations in poorer countries, which can lead to poor working conditions, human rights abuses and the degradation of the environment. Moreover, this increased inequality between countries leads to a higher inequality within countries. Some regions may flourish, while others suffer, which increases the already existing wealth disparity. The process of cultural homogenization that is associated with globalization also threatens cultural diversity. In addition, it can lead to increased social dissatisfaction and greater political unrest. In order to achieve a sustainable and equitable world economy, it is important to achieve a balance between the benefits of globalization and the protection of local culture, the working environment and the environment.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.; In the first place, education serves many purposes apart from the preparation for a career. Secondly, while there may be some students who do not see the relevance of their subjects to their future careers, those who advocate the right to leave school early overlook the significance of education. Literature and mathematics are essential in developing a well-rounded and able person. Literature develops empathy and a greater understanding of different cultures, while mathematics gives students problem-solving skills that are applicable in a range of situations. These subjects develop critical thinking, creativity and an appreciation of different ideas and opinions. It is impossible for a young person to see how knowledge they gain at school will be useful later in life. And exposure to different subjects may ignite their passion and lead them in unexpected career directions that would have been out of their reach if they had specialised too early. Thirdly, allowing students to leave school early, based on their current interests, would rob them of many educational opportunities. Fourthly, an education system that encourages students to leave early may actually perpetuate social inequalities, as the workforce would be less skilled. Students from less privileged backgrounds would be more likely to leave school early and work in jobs that would pay poorly and perpetuate the poverty cycle. It would be more equitable to reform the curriculum to include vocational and work-related training while still providing a solid grounding in the fundamentals, so that students are prepared for not just jobs but life. In conclusion, it is important to take students’ interests and make education more relevant, but advocating the right to leave school early would have harmful consequences.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.; Advertisements in our society play a very important role in shaping the desires of consumers. The thesis that the high sales of popular goods are a reflection of the power of advertising and not the needs of society is a controversial statement. I would agree in most cases. For example, fashion brands use celebrity status and social media to promote their products as status and identity symbols, which makes consumers buy items not out of necessity, but because they want to be included in the group or show off to others. The company's sophisticated marketing strategy stimulates emotions, generates brand loyalty and stimulates the desire to buy non-essential goods. These goods are therefore in high demand and are not necessarily in line with a person's real needs. The same phenomenon can be seen in technology, where consumers are waiting for the latest mobile phone, not because the old one is inadequate, but because they are persuaded by the advertisements that they need to have the latest and most essential one. This makes consumers buy new and expensive gadgets, which is exactly what the consumer industry is advertising. Nevertheless, the prevailing role of advertising can largely distort the perception of what is essential and contribute to overconsumption. On the other hand, I would like to mention that some advertising serves to inform consumers about the genuine usefulness of the goods and can improve the quality of life. In general, although there are cases where advertisements emphasize the needs of the population, I believe that the overall tendency is to stimulate the desire of the population, so the sale of goods is more a reflection of the power of advertising than the needs of the population.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.; First of all, high gun ownership is closely related to high gun death. There are countries with very low gun homicides and suicides, so limiting access to guns can also reduce gun homicides and suicides. In places where gun control is lax, guns can easily fall into the hands of people with mental illness and criminal backgrounds, and it is difficult for these people to get guns, so as to avoid potential disasters. . The most important reason for limiting gun ownership is to prevent gun violence. In addition, people who own guns can easily mistrust each other, which is also the main reason for increasing the frequency of gun riots. On the contrary, the limiting of gun ownership can also increase public security. Another important reason is the harm caused in the family. The research shows that in households with guns, there are more accidental shootings, more domestic violence, and more suicides. So the more firearms people own, the more dangerous they are. It is very important to limit the number of guns, so as to ensure public security. The problem of gun ownership should be solved with the relationship between individual rights and social security, and by regulating the ownership of guns, we can avoid the tragedy of the occurrence of guns.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.; On the one hand, it is said that sports are a breeding ground for nationalism and rivalry. On the other hand, it is generally agreed that sports, which are approached with the spirit of co-operation and friendly competition, can really lead to the understanding of all peoples of the world and, therefore, are of great importance in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Indeed, the passions of fans are directed to the manifestation of national pride rather than to hostility and aggression. During the World Cup, for example, fans from different countries gather and, as they gather, they communicate with each other and they begin to understand each other, respecting each other's customs and traditions, and this in turn contributes to a sense of community in a friendly relationship. As a result, a spirit of friendly rivalry develops between the teams, and the very co-operation of the players on the field between themselves, leads to a decrease in tension. Finally, the very essence of the sport is not the conflict, but the competition. The ability to compete in an organized way, to demonstrate one's strength, is the goal of any sport. Moreover, at some sporting events, tensions and even clashes occur between the fans, which, in spite of all the potential for unity, may be destroyed, but this is often an exception rather than a rule. The World Cup, for example, becomes a demonstration of individual skills and a team effort, a healthy outlet for patriotic emotions, rather than the expression of political conflict. And so, through shared experience and mutual respect, it is possible to promote a sense of world community, which can only be good for the people of the world. In conclusion, it must be noted that, despite the complexities of the relationship between the countries, the events such as the World Cup and other sporting events, in the main, provide a way to reduce tension and, therefore, to create a sense of world community.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.; The belief that technology increases the gap between rich and poor emphasizes the affluent privileges of the latest technology. In today's world, technology penetrates into almost every aspect of life, and the debate about its impact on the gap between rich and poor is increasingly relevant. The access to high-tech education and expensive equipment and high-speed Internet connections are limited to people in higher income groups, which reduces the chances of poor people competing in the increasingly technological economy. In addition, people from wealthy families can buy technology and go into high-tech fields, such as software development and data analysis, whereas poor people have no such opportunities. Conversely, those who believe that technology reduces the gap between rich and poor argue that technology provides many different tools and platforms for upward social mobility. Moreover, the disproportionate concentration of technology in urban areas further increases the gap between cities and countryside and exacerbates regional inequality. However, the quality of technology will largely depend on the system of regulating access to it. For example, the e-learning platform can help people from underdeveloped countries to receive a reasonable salary or even a free course, which can improve their skills. Finally, the digital economy is a great way for people to get income regardless of their location and facilitate their financial independence. In conclusion, in order for technology to be a tool for equality, it is necessary to strengthen the universal provision of basic education and invest in the construction of the Internet.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.; In my opinion, space exploration is a very beneficial investment, which has several dimensions. First, space exploration encourages technological innovation. Secondly, it is an investment that has economic value. For example, the technology of satellite communications, the global positioning system, and various materials used in the construction industry were developed as a result of space exploration. The benefits of these discoveries go beyond convenience, improving global communication, disaster management, and helping in the fields of medicine and agriculture. Third, the need for international collaboration in space exploration is a basis for peace and cooperation between countries. Through projects such as the International Space Station, countries can build relationships that will be useful for the future. Fourth, there are various problems on earth, such as the destruction of the environment, the exhaustion of natural resources, and overpopulation, and space exploration offers solutions to these problems. The solution lies in research on the use of microgravity, and the long-term project of human settlement can be an alternative way of life. These goals offer hope for the future. Although we look to the sky, we should not forget the deep benefits that can be achieved on earth. To conclude, governments should not only make space exploration, but also use it.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.; I think that having a job while you're a teenager is a good thing for students, provided it is done properly. There has been much debate about the integration of teenagers' jobs into their studies, and in certain countries this practice is common. Students, in combining their jobs and studies, learn time management, commitment, and the importance of being disciplined. These are invaluable life skills that are used when a person is already an adult and are able to thrive in their future employment. In addition, having a job as a teenager means that teenagers are able to earn their own money, and thus acquire autonomy and responsibility. A teenager who works in a retail store, for example, not only earns money but also learns how to interact with customers and deal with them in a professional manner. It is important to note that it is important to strike a balance between the study and the job. The resulting understanding of the value of money can lead to better money management in the future. But it is also important that teenagers take jobs that offer flexible hours and are not too demanding. Working too much can be a source of stress and affect a student's performance in school. With proper guidance and the right balance, working part-time can be a positive experience for teenagers. In conclusion, while there are disadvantages associated with teenagers having a job while they are still studying, the benefits, such as learning life skills and financial independence, outweigh the disadvantages.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.; An essay about the benefit of sending students to institutions/organizations for unpaid work is an important part of modern education. This practice has many advantages for both students and institutions/organizations, both practical and social, and it strengthens community bonds. Students get an insight into their chosen career, they can develop social skills and be connected to the working environment and future contacts. Students are more capable of applying theoretical knowledge in practical cases and thereby learn the material better and remember it longer. The institutions and organizations, on the other hand, also benefit greatly from the students' participation in their work. Students can often bring new and positive ideas and perspectives that can benefit the institution's work and its activities. By providing mentorship and supervision, the institutions and organizations can further strengthen the sense of community and social responsibility. To ensure that students get proper guidance and that the work is properly defined and delimited can be a positive experience for both sides. In addition, the students can help the staff, free up the time of the staff for more complex tasks and at the same time enrich the working environment with their passion and desire to learn. Students can gain a valuable insight into the working world and be prepared for their future careers. In the event that short unpaid work placements are organized well, the benefits to both sides can be considerable.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.; In the first place, it is necessary to realize that the role of self-determination is very important in employee motivation. Although higher wages can be a powerful motivator for improved work performance, it is overly simplistic to consider financial rewards as the only motivator. For example, studies have shown that employees who feel appreciated by their colleagues and managers are more productive, regardless of their salary. According to this view, factors such as personal growth, a sense of achievement and personal satisfaction can significantly influence the willingness of individuals to work. Furthermore, the quality of the working environment is also an important factor in the level of motivation. The supportive climate, the opportunities for teamwork and the efficiency of the leadership can lead to higher levels of employee commitment. Furthermore, non-monetary rewards such as career development opportunities, flexible working hours and health insurance can also increase productivity. For example, employees value the opportunity to learn new skills, as well as a balanced and secure life in their jobs, and this leads to increased performance. It is therefore necessary to adopt a multi-level approach that takes into account the intrinsic motivation of employees, the working environment and non-monetary rewards to create a committed and productive workforce.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.; For one thing, international sporting events, such as the World Cup, bring together different peoples and cultures, which, in turn, could result in better diplomatic relations. Second, these events provide a unique platform for individuals and nations to compete with one another in the spirit of companionship and mutual enjoyment, which can lead to the growth of mutual trust and, in the long run, peace and mutual understanding. The universal language of sports makes it possible for people to communicate with one another and for them to establish a sense of solidarity rather than a sense of division. For example, during the World Cup, people of different nationalities gather together and celebrate their common love of the game, thus putting aside any differences and political hostilities between countries. This is because, when they gather together in the interest of their national teams and celebrate their victories, they establish a feeling of solidarity and a common national identity, rather than focusing on the differences between nations. Third, these events are a way of releasing the sometimes strong feelings of national pride that citizens may have, since the sport is a regulated, controlled and safe arena for them to express these feelings without the risk of violence. These events, therefore, have the potential to bring about the easing of international tensions and the fostering of patriotic feelings, but they can also result in negative emotions if they are not properly organized. On the other hand, it must be pointed out that, at times, international sporting events can lead to a rise in tension, especially when there are political agendas involved and there are historical rivalries between nations. In such cases, violent nationalism and hostility can disrupt the sporting spirit. With the right attitude, however, these events can be a source of peace, international understanding and the celebration of shared joy. In conclusion, although international sporting events such as the World Cup are not a panacea for easing international tensions, they do provide a positive outlet for patriotic feelings and foster a sense of solidarity among people of different nationalities.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.; In my opinion, it is very important to promote alternative energy sources because they have more benefits than one might think. It is a matter of great importance to all countries to solve the problems of climate change, energy security and sustainable development. The protection of the environment and the preservation of public health are only two of many advantages of promoting alternative energy sources. Adopting alternative energy sources is in line with international commitments, such as the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in global temperatures and prevent disasters caused by climate change. Using traditional fossil fuels is a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, which are harmful to the climate and health of people. The green economy has grown rapidly, and many jobs have been created in its manufacture, installation and maintenance. A country that develops alternative energy sources not only increases employment, but also increases energy security by reducing its dependence on imported fuels. Secondly, investing in alternative energy sources brings economic benefits. Reduced air pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels will benefit health and significantly reduce the cost of health care. In addition, by promoting alternative energy sources, public health will improve. It will also result in lower energy prices and local economic development. This means that not only does it address urgent social and environmental issues, but also economic and health issues. In addition, the development of clean energy is of great importance for underdeveloped countries. It will give them reliable energy and help protect their health. In my opinion, promoting alternative energy sources should be the top priority of governments and all other policy makers.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.; I firmly agree with the statement that direct financial help is essential for unemployed people. Firstly, unemployment may cause great difficulties for the individual and his family. It can lead to poverty and poor health. Direct financial help is a safety net that ensures that the needs of people in difficult circumstances are satisfied. Direct help for unemployed people stimulates the local economy and thus reduces the effects of unemployment and may even help the recovery. Secondly, when unemployed people receive financial help, they are likely to spend it on essential goods and services. Direct help also encourages them to seek employment. Unemployed people may also invest in further education and training, which increases their skills and improves their employment prospects. By helping unemployed people, the government makes the economy stronger and benefits everyone. In conclusion, I believe that the government should give direct financial help to unemployed people. Not only is this help useful for the individual, but it also strengthens the economy by making people more skilled. In uncertain times, the government must help the unemployed to recover and to contribute to the recovery.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.; ? The argument that universities should give their students the practical skills needed in the workplace can be justified in a number of ways. On the one hand, in the context of the global job market, employers are increasingly interested in employees with skills. In my opinion, universities should strive to strike a balance between these two contrasting ideas in order to be able to fulfill their role effectively in an ever-changing world. Universities that emphasize vocational education and skills development often provide their students with more employment opportunities by aligning academic programs with industry needs. This pragmatic approach provides the students with a direct path from the university to the workplace, thereby contributing to the economic development and social progress of a country. With tuition fees rising and students being burdened with debt, they are very aware of the investment they are making in their education. An education should be about much more than simply getting a job. It should be about developing a person’s creative thinking, independent thinking, and imagination. Many subjects, such as philosophy, history, and the humanities, inherently encourage these values, which are also an important part of a well-rounded education. Universities should aim to offer a combination of the practical and the theoretical in their curricula in order to produce graduates who are both skilled in their field and well-rounded, responsible citizens. This kind of education also encourages curiosity, which develops an interest in learning for its own sake, making students more receptive to the world around them. People who have a deep curiosity and are interested in learning are more likely to be active and engaged members of society, making a valuable contribution to social and cultural development. Therefore, I believe that the main purpose of a university is to combine the practical and the theoretical in a way that ensures a relevant and engaging education. This combination of skills and theory will also prepare students for the complexity of modern life and equip them with the ability to adapt to new developments in the workplace.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.; I disagree with the statement that zoos have no useful purpose. Zoos have an important role in education, research and conservation, and are therefore an important institution in our society. The argument on the value and utility of zoos is a complex and ambiguous one, and people are very divided on this issue. However, there is no doubt that zoos have a great deal to offer. The first role of zoos is that of a center for the education of people of all ages. Through close encounters with animals, they teach people to recognize and value animals, and help them to learn about their behavior and habitat. Zoos also contribute to the conservation of animal species. Zoos take part in breeding programs for endangered species and thereby contribute to the survival of animals that might otherwise have become extinct. For example, children who visit a zoo often become interested in the conservation of animals and subsequently take part in practical conservation efforts. Zoos also take part in conservation programs that protect natural habitats and protect the world’s vanishing species. Zoos are also places of scientific research. For example, the successful breeding of Arabian oryx and Californian condors shows how zoos can directly help to restore a species that has been endangered. The zoo’s role in conservation, education and research cannot be ignored. Through research into animal behavior, the results of which can then be applied to the zoo, scientists have been able to make important discoveries in a variety of fields, including veterinary science and the study of animal behavior. I am convinced that zoos play an important role in today’s world. Zoos can help to reduce the gap between people and animals and encourage a better relationship between people and animals.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.; I would like to say that there are both advantages and disadvantages of both approaches, but that I agree with the opinion that distance learning can be as good as the traditional way. For one thing, distance learning has more flexibility than learning in person. Distance learners with families, jobs, or geographical barriers can achieve their goals without the restrictions of time and space. However, it is important to consider the disadvantages of distance learning, especially in the area of human relationships. Distance learning is less likely to provide opportunities for students to meet each other, to share experiences, and to establish long-term relationships with teachers and peers. But if this accessibility is to be maintained, it is important to remember that the advantages of distance learning can also be deducted from the disadvantages of distance learning. In addition, distance learning requires a high degree of personal self-discipline and motivation. Without the guidance of the classroom, it is difficult to manage the time and the habit of studying. The degree of socialization that is experienced in a physical environment can also be useful for personal development and establishing social relationships. For all these reasons, I believe that the effectiveness of learning in each case depends on the individual, his goals, his circumstances, and his personality. Some people prefer to learn in a traditional way where they can receive immediate feedback and support from their teachers. In conclusion, I think that instead of judging one method as better, we must examine the advantages and disadvantages of both.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it."; I agree that although many people and businesses have benefited from these changes, a large part of the population has not benefited from them at all. The invention of modern communication technology has revolutionized the way people communicate, access information, and conduct business, but the benefits are not equally distributed. To businesses, it is a powerful tool to reach new customers and collaborate across national borders. To individuals, the ability to instantly connect with their relatives and friends has transformed social relationships and created a sense of community for even the most distant populations. On the other hand, the development of modern communication technology, such as cell phones, social media, and video telephony, has increased efficiency and communication to a great extent. In developing countries, limited access to the Internet and communication devices makes it difficult for people to take advantage of the benefits of these new technologies. Moreover, access to a wealth of information on the Internet has enabled individuals to learn and develop their skills at an unprecedented speed, and has helped to bridge the educational gap that existed in the past. But with the new technology, comes new problems, such as cyberbullying, disinformation, and the decline in face-to-face communication. This digital divide has also further deepened the social inequality between people of different education and economic backgrounds. Moreover, for older people, a lack of ability to adapt to new communication methods has also reduced social contact and increased isolation. And so, to avoid the digital divide, it is important to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to use the power of modern communication tools, and to encourage more balanced and inclusive use of these tools. In summary, while the benefits of modern communication technology have undoubtedly changed the lives of many people, it is also necessary to realize that these benefits are not equally distributed.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.; This is the first of many good arguments in favour of music education as part of a student’s overall development. While opponents argue that musical education is a waste of time, I would argue that musical education is necessary for a well-rounded education and is a good idea for all schools. Students have an outlet for their feelings and thoughts, which encourages them to build their confidence and develop a strong sense of identity. All this is good for mental health and provides them with the coping mechanisms they need to face the challenges of adolescence. As the world moves towards more technology and science, it is important to nurture the artistic talents of students. Music requires discipline, focus and practice, which are useful skills in other subjects. Studies have shown that students who take music classes perform better in school, especially in math and language classes. Also, the ensemble and the choir show students the importance of teamwork and collaboration. In the process, the schools would enrich the artistic skills of the students and improve their academic performance. It’s not just about learning notes and rhythms, it’s about developing creativity, critical thinking, and social skills. In conclusion, although some people may think music classes are a waste of time, the many benefits they offer outweigh any perceived disadvantages. Musical training is a valuable mirror of real-world collaboration, and a stepping stone to success in the future, especially in the workplace, where teamwork is often essential. It is important to acknowledge the importance of a well-rounded education that includes music.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.; The money distribution between universities and sport clubs has been the subject of much debate for many years. I believe that universities should allocate equal resources to these two departments because they both play an important role in student life. Universities play a critical role in the development of students, not only academically but also socially and physically. Universities have a lot of money allocated to their sport clubs, but I believe that their sport clubs should also have equal funding with the libraries. University libraries are the traditional bastions of learning that provide students with a wide range of resources to help them with their academic achievements, they support research, promote critical thinking and facilitate learning in general. On the other hand, sports activities significantly contribute to the health and well-being of students, and participation in sports teaches important life skills such as leadership, self-discipline and time management. Academic success, however, is not based only on intellectual development. By providing equal resources to both, universities can recognize the importance of a well-rounded student life. Moreover, it is essential to the mental health of students during periods of academic stress. In conclusion, universities should allocate equal money to their sport activities and their university libraries to provide a balanced and healthy student life. Similarly, by providing equal resources to these two departments, universities can show that they respect the diverse needs of their student population. Both parts support the different aspects of student life, and a harmonious resource allocation can help improve both academic achievement and personal development, which is essential to prepare students for a successful future.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity."; The benefits of English being used as a lingua franca, as well as the consequences of losing linguistic diversity, cannot be ignored. The widespread use of English makes communication easier and more accessible, it creates a common ground between people from different backgrounds, which in turn enhances the possibility of economic exchange and cooperation. But the general belief that English is a tool for advancing careers and education is not without its downsides. Many languages are disappearing as the younger generations rely on English for their careers and studies. The significance of English for employment and education is widely recognized. Many minority languages are neglected, this may result in the loss of native speakers of these languages feeling obliged to abandon their own language for the more common one. Losing linguistic diversity impoverishes our humanity, every language expresses unique features of identity and knowledge that cannot be easily translated into another. Losing a language means losing an entire culture, history, customs, worldviews. In conclusion, although the benefits of English as a lingua franca, and its influence on the world’s economy, are substantial, so is the loss of linguistic and cultural diversity. So the world must maintain a balance between using English as a lingua franca and preserving lesser-known languages, to preserve our world’s cultural and historical richness. The erasure of languages not only alters personal identity but also weakens community bonds and continuity of culture.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.; To what extent do you agree or disagree? The argument for the use of animals for human benefit is an ancient one. Those who argue for this side claim that animals have always been useful to humans. They are food, clothing, work, and help, and they are companions and emotional support. These people say that animals are living beings and that they can suffer and feel joy and therefore deserve protection from exploitation and abuse. These people claim that humans are at the top of the food chain, and using animals for various needs, whether it's food, science, or companionship, is a natural and necessary thing. These people claim that ethics requires that we respect and love all life and that we have to develop alternatives that don't involve the suffering or sacrifice of animals. The essence of the argument lies in balancing the needs of human use with the moral obligations of respect and compassion for all life. Many practices associated with animal husbandry, animal testing, and entertainment are often criticized for their inhumane treatment of animals. We have to be aware of animal rights and ensure their respect. In short, the challenge is to find a balance between the use of animals for human benefit and their right to respect and protection.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture."; So what is the importance of art galleries? First, they offer a very deep and detailed experience that is difficult to replace. In the second place, museums and art galleries will adapt to new technology and will be able to offer different experiences. Also, the atmosphere of the museum, with its architecture, lighting, reverence and silence, makes it easier to appreciate the art. When you visit an art gallery, you can experience the feeling of a painting or a painting, which is not possible on a screen, and it gives a different meaning. In addition, they are the meeting places of different people, and people with different interests, with a common love of art and culture, form a community. This unique environment cannot be replaced by screens and virtual reality. Many museums use technology to enhance the visitor experience, not replace it. And this social aspect is extremely important, especially in the increasingly digital world where the virtual experience is often solitary. In conclusion, although technology has changed the way we engage with art and exhibitions, it is not likely that museums and galleries will disappear soon. On the contrary, they will probably thrive as technological innovations are combined with the unique experience of seeing art in person. Virtual reality, for example, is a useful addition that allows institutions to reach a wider audience and allow people who cannot visit to see the art.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.; The proponents of the idea of a broad education claim that learning various subjects, such as mathematics, literature, science, and the arts, helps develop students' critical thinking, creative, and problem-solving abilities. The debate on whether teenagers should learn all subjects or just the ones they are best at or interested in is a heated issue, and both sides have good arguments. Students, in my opinion, can discover their hidden talents and interests when they study various subjects, and they can also collaborate better with peers from different academic backgrounds. A broad education prepares students for an uncertain future, where flexibility will be essential. Critics of the current system argue that a one-size-fits-all approach discourages students from excelling in less favorite subjects. The proponents of a specialization approach argue that studying subjects in which a student excels or is passionate about leads to a more engaged and motivated learner. The best solution, in my opinion, would be to combine elements of both views. It is important that students have a broad education, but giving them the choice to pursue their interests in depth can enrich their learning experience. When teachers encourage students to focus on their interests, they are nurturing a generation of engaged and inspired learners. It is my belief that a curriculum that allows for personalization of studies would best enable a student to acquire not only a breadth of knowledge but also a depth of understanding.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.; The debate on whether the advantages of English outweigh the disadvantages is a complex and multi-faceted one. English has undoubtedly facilitated the communication and economic prosperity of many different cultures, but it also has major consequences for the many lesser-known languages that are dying out at an alarming rate. English is a bridging language, it allows people from diverse backgrounds to work together and create. In an increasingly interconnected world, English facilitates the sharing of information and business practices, thereby promoting knowledge and innovation. On the other hand, the extinction of lesser-known languages is a loss not only to their native speakers but to all humankind. For example, scientific research is often conducted in English, and so is the dissemination of academic knowledge and the subsequent economic progress of nations that engage in the global market. The extinction of a language can be compared to the loss of a species in a rich biodiverse environment. It impoverishes our collective cultural heritage and diminishes the richness of human expression. Each language represents a unique cultural identity, history and worldview. The promotion of linguistic diversity must therefore be facilitated by the encouragement of bilingualism and the safeguarding of lesser-known languages. Furthermore, linguistic diversity is essential for the creativity and innovation that are necessary for new ideas and solutions to emerge. In the end, the preservation of lesser-known languages must be seen as important as the advantages of English.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws."; I completely agree that creative artists should have the freedom to express their ideas, as this encourages artistic innovation, variety of thought and social progress. The freedom of the artist is the basis of cultural expression and innovation. For example, new forms of art, such as avant-garde, pop, experimental music, can be born from the freedom of the artist. First of all, the freedom of the artist to express his ideas is the origin of innovation. This means that a dynamic environment can stimulate creativity, which would be stifled in a more restricted environment. Furthermore, creative expression is essential for addressing social issues and advocating change. If the artist were restricted by government control, they would be prevented from saying what they needed to say about these issues, and the public would be deprived of a richer and more critical perspective. However, it is also important to realize that there are limits to artistic freedom. For example, during the civil rights movement, powerful protest songs have been written, and revealing films have been made that point out social flaws. For example, they could promote bad ideas or offend a specific group of people. However, rather than restricting the artist, the government could encourage a more critical debate about the effects of art on society. The free exchange of ideas contributes to the cultural diversity of a society and encourages public debate about important social issues.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.; The argument for encouraging competition in children is that it encourages perseverance and determination, which will stand them in good stead for the world of work and other aspects of adult life. The argument against competition is that it encourages children to communicate better, to work together, and to be more tolerant of other people’s views. The argument for encouraging a sense of competition in children is that it encourages them to set themselves personal goals, to work hard to achieve them, and to develop self-esteem from these achievements. In my opinion, a balance between the two is best for the development of children. The values of co-operation are that of empathy, and mutual support, and these values encourage social harmony and a sense of working as a team, both of which are essential for success in most areas of work. Schools and parents should provide opportunities for children to experience the pleasures of competition, but also give them the chance to work as a team, and to enjoy the social advantages of co-operation. This combination of team work and individual achievements will give a well-balanced individual. Competition and co-operation both have their values, and the key to the education of children is to ensure that both these elements are taught. Children will learn the value of perseverance and self-control through competition, and at the same time will learn the value of co-operation, of empathy and teamwork. This will help them to develop into well-balanced adults, able to cope with the problems of life, and able to make a positive contribution to society.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict."; Although some claim that abolishing the death penalty leads to an increase in insecurity and violence, I think the relationship is not so clear and there are more effective ways to ensure public security. The debate on capital punishment, or the death penalty, is complex and controversial, and its advocates and opponents raise many different arguments about the effects of capital punishment. Evidence on the deterrent effect of the death penalty is mixed. Supporters of the death penalty claim that the certainty of the death penalty deters potential criminals from engaging in violent behavior. Several studies have shown that regions without the death penalty do not necessarily have a higher crime rate than regions with the death penalty. Moreover, other factors such as social and economic conditions, access to education, the effectiveness of law enforcement, and community engagement have a greater influence on crime rates. In addition, the ethical considerations of capital punishment cannot be ignored. In my opinion, the irreversibility of the death penalty raises concerns about the possibility of erroneous convictions, and the moral consequences of state-sanctioned killing. Moreover, capital punishment does not address the root causes of violence, such as poverty, mental illness, and addiction, which if addressed would lead to a more substantial reduction in crime. In conclusion, although some may argue that capital punishment is necessary to maintain public order, I believe that it is not the most effective means of preventing violent crime. There are better ways to reduce crime than capital punishment. The justice system, rehabilitation, and addressing the underlying causes of crime are more effective in reducing crime rates.
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.; This step brings both a number of advantages and disadvantages that must be considered before taking it. The main advantage of this break is the opportunity to develop as a person. It makes the person more mature and responsible for university studies. Young people are often unaware of the world and have little practical experience. Traveling or working opens their eyes to other cultures, views and points of view, develops their independence and communication, critical thinking and negotiating skills. It also brings some economic advantages: many young people can earn enough to pay for university studies, thus avoiding the burden of student loans. As a disadvantage, it is a loss of academic momentum. After a year of abandoning education, it is difficult to enter the university. Young people do not always have the opportunity to travel or work effectively during this time, which leads to economic disparity and possibly social inequality. Familiarity with study habits is also lost, which makes it difficult to enter the academic world. Finally, the decision should be made after careful consideration of the goals, circumstances and readiness of each person.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question."; Our dependence on them is likely to grow. One area that may develop is artificial intelligence, which could change things in many ways, for example, in education, where machines could be made to teach each student individually. Another way in which computers could be used is in environmental monitoring. With more sophisticated systems for collecting and analysing data, our understanding of climate change could be improved, allowing us to develop more sustainable resource and conservation strategies. Also, in future, automatic driving could change the way we travel, reducing the number of accidents and allowing more freedom of movement for the elderly and the disabled. Although our dependence on computers is beneficial, there are some concerns. For example, in medicine, the role of computers in predicting outbreaks of disease and the health of individual patients could be increased. Moreover, our growing dependence on computers raises fundamental questions about the nature of human intelligence. Also, if there is an unequal distribution of access to these new technologies, there is a risk of greater social inequality. Lastly, if we become so dependent on them that if our systems fail we will not know how to cope without them. In conclusion, although there are many benefits to the use of computers in future, it is important to keep a balanced view of them. Embracing new developments while maintaining a critical attitude to their impact on us will help ensure that everyone benefits from them without losing the most human values.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.; Although it is desirable to achieve gender equality, the idea of rigidly imposing a quota may not be the most appropriate way to do so. Recently, a debate has arisen about whether universities should be based on the principle of equal gender. Some people think that universities should admit equal numbers of men and women in all subjects, and that a rigid quota system should be set up. On the one hand, if there is a quota, there may be a need for education institutions to have specific strategies to attract and retain female students in these subjects, and this will ultimately lead to a more balanced workforce. Gender equality is a very important concept for university education because it makes it possible to increase the diversity of thinking and collaboration. However, it is necessary to recognize that the degree of preference for each subject varies, and that some are naturally male and others are naturally female. There should be no quotas for university students. Admission should be based on the talent, interest and potential of the individual. However, when quotas are applied, it may not be in the best interests of students and the university. Instead of applying rigid quotas, the university should establish an environment where the underrepresented genders can pursue various subjects and encourage them to enter them.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.; ? I agree that people will spend less time cooking in the future, and there are many reasons for this. First of all, our busy lifestyle has reduced the time allocated to cooking. Secondly, technology has changed our lives. As our societies develop, our work and personal life will become more and more busy, and the time we spend on cooking will become less and less. All the more so since the development of food delivery, which allows us to enjoy different kinds of food at home by only a few clicks on our phones. Thirdly, there are more and more kitchen appliances, such as instant pots, air fryers and meal kits, which promise to reduce cooking time, and people are more willing to spend less time in the kitchen. Fourthly, there are more and more people who prefer to eat out or order food instead of cooking at home, especially the younger generation, who prefer to spend more time on social experiences and convenience than on traditional practices. Finally, the culture is changing. As cooking becomes less common, there is less and less appreciation of the value of this skill and the pleasures of cooking. It is clear that people will spend less time cooking in the future, because of the busyness of life, the development of technology and the changing requirements of society.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.; The question of whether traditional or modern games are more beneficial for the development of children's skills has long been a hotly debated issue among educators, parents and child development experts. Among the advantages of both games, the following advantages should be mentioned: a) traditional games are usually played outdoors, and usually involve a group of people, which encourages children to learn social skills, such as cooperation, communication and conflict resolution. Moreover, the games involve a great deal of physical activity, thereby helping children to develop not only their physical health, but also their ability to explore different terrains and safely take risks. Moreover, they help children to develop the ability to interact face to face with other children. However, these games often lack the social interactions that are essential for emotional intelligence and social development. On the other hand, modern games, especially video games, can develop other skills, such as hand-eye co-ordination and problem-solving skills. But at the same time, they can not replace the positive learning experiences provided by traditional games. On the other hand, it is important to recognize that there are certain skills that children can learn from modern games, especially when they are designed in a developmentally appropriate way. Moreover, too much screen time can lead to the development of sedentary habits and the emergence of health problems in children. In conclusion, while there are some advantages to both games, it is my view that traditional games are more useful in the development of children's skills. Their emphasis on physical activity, socialization and the development of important life skills, and their importance for a child's overall development, make them indispensable in children's lives.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.; I absolutely agree that government should pay more attention to medical care and education, and less on building entertainment venues. First, medical care is a fundamental human need. To this end, the government must ensure that its people have access to medical care, regardless of their social status. In many countries, lack of funding for medical care has led to overcrowding in hospitals, a lack of medical equipment, and a lack of preventive measures. It is obvious that medical care must be improved. Secondly, education is a foundation for national progress. It not only enhances the potential of individuals, but also cultivates their ability to think critically, promotes innovation and entrepreneurship, and encourages responsible citizenship. This can also help to break the cycle of poverty and contribute to the development of society. In addition, while the government must also promote culture, education and art, it should not be at the expense of people's most fundamental rights. On the contrary, building theaters and sports stadiums, although they can provide temporary entertainment, but they are more beneficial to future generations, because they can provide more resources and better teaching materials. Furthermore, the government should not only consider its people's health and education as a moral obligation, but also as an investment in its future. Through various social policies and subsidies, the government can help the people develop their cultural lives, but they should not build expensive theaters and sports stadiums.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.; On the one hand, technological development is so fast that it may be outdated and irrelevant in a fast-moving modern world. On the other hand, it is reductive to say that it is useless to preserve it. You may be neglecting the cultural significance of what has been learned. For example, automation and digital tools have radically changed the industry, agriculture and trade, which formerly depended on manual skills. This change may lead to a lack of knowledge of the past, which is passed on from one generation to another. For example, traditional weaving skills not only provide a source of income, but also a source of pride and cultural diversity. Many indigenous practices and manual skills are intimately connected with identity and history, whereas modern technology does not always provide such a feeling of community and connection. Finally, the issue should not be framed as a choice between technology and tradition. The preservation of old skills can coexist and even complement the development of technology. For example, tourists are often interested in the authenticity of local crafts and this interest can develop along with the development of industry and the economy. Also, although it is true that technology changes the lives of people, it is also important to preserve and cherish old skills, so that they can be fully integrated into the cultural wealth of modern society. Therefore, instead of arguing that one is incompatible with the other, one can see how they can complement each other.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful."; On the one hand, artistic expression is an important part of the development of culture, exploration of ideas, and reflection of social changes. Art can challenge social conventions, and encourage people to think and act. The debate about artistic freedom to express their ideas is a complex and multi-faceted one. Those who believe that artistic freedom should be regulated by the government, because artistic expression can lead to the dissemination of harmful and hateful ideas and propaganda, and incite social unrest and violence. Artists' works often serve as a mirror, reflecting the different voices in society and enabling people to communicate, thereby promoting social progress. However, limiting artistic freedom can lead to authoritarianism, in which governments suppress dissenting voices under the pretext of regulating artistic freedom. In this case, government intervention is necessary to protect vulnerable groups and maintain public decorum. As I see it, artistic expression should be encouraged as long as it is done within the law, but I also think that the government should not restrict it too much. History has shown that when a regime tries to control the creative forces of society, artistic freedom is often the first to go, thereby limiting creativity and reducing the richness of artistic expression. A delicate balance between protecting the public and protecting artistic freedom should be maintained, because art is essential for the development of humanity and the evolution of culture.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.; This debate has been going on for decades. Some argue that the government should restrict violent content in the media to reduce violent crimes, while others argue that these measures violate freedom of expression. I argue that although the media do have an influence on social attitudes and behaviors, the government's control over violent content in the media should be limited and must be balanced with individual freedom. The government should regulate the use of violent images by introducing age restrictions and rating systems. The government should restrict the media's access to vulnerable populations by imposing age limits and age restrictions. A simple relationship between media violence and violence on the street ignores other influential factors such as poverty, mental illness, family background, and family life. But it is also important to recognize personal responsibility and the complex nature of violent crime. Introducing media literacy can help people understand what they see and what they play, and people can make better decisions. Besides, violent content in the media can be regulated and managed, but it should not be severely controlled by the government. In addition, violent content in the media has a profound effect on artistic expression and the basic principle of freedom of speech in democratic societies. The solution is to educate people to have a clear understanding of the relationship between violence and the media, to protect freedom of expression, and to encourage the complexity of the relationship between violence and the media.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles."; For my part I reject this statement. I believe that the opportunities that have been created for women have contributed significantly to our social, economic and cultural development. In the past women were given few opportunities to enter the world of business and other occupations. The present situation is different. Women have the opportunity to study and to hold responsible positions in business and the professions. They are more likely to be innovators. In the field of policymaking they play an active role in the development of public health, education and family life, which have led to a more compassionate and well-organized society. The number of women in government has had a positive effect on the way the nation is run, too. However, there are still many obstacles to overcome, such as discrimination in the workplace, the under-representation of women in certain professions, and the problems of combining work and family life. This change has also brought about a cultural change. The way people think about the place of women in society is changing. Women’s increased opportunities have led to significant progress in society as a whole. The remaining problems are not caused by the expansion of opportunities for women, but are rather a result of the inequality of the past. It is necessary to work on these problems, not to set back the progress made by women. The society as a whole should support the further development of equality and the progress of women. Although there are still many obstacles to be overcome, the benefits of the increased participation of women in all aspects of life are far more important than the problems.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised."; They can effectively encourage people to use other means of transport, such as public transport, cycling or walking. While higher fuel prices may reduce the use of cars and hence traffic and pollution, I think this alone is insufficient and may lead to further social ills. It may, for example, have a disproportionately negative effect on lower-income households, which rely heavily on their own cars for daily transportation, and may be unable to afford increased fuel costs. The price elasticity of demand, in which higher prices lead to a decrease in demand, shows that lower-income households are more likely to be affected by this than higher-income households. Higher fuel prices can reduce car use and traffic congestion by encouraging the use of other, more efficient means of transport. To achieve this, a combination of measures is needed, such as a greater investment in public transport. If, on the other hand, there are efforts to encourage the use of electric cars by offering financial incentives, this could lead to a much lower use of fossil fuels. In addition, by implementing stricter regulations on the emissions of industries and vehicles, combined with greater public awareness of the environmental effects of car use, car use can be significantly reduced. Finally, by developing pedestrian zones and bike lanes, non-motorized transport can be encouraged, contributing to a healthier lifestyle and cleaner air. By introducing a comprehensive plan, cities can more effectively tackle the pressing issues of traffic and pollution. In conclusion, although higher fuel prices can relieve congestion and pollution for a time, a more comprehensive and socially equitable approach is needed to achieve sustainable development.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.; I think there are arguments for banning certain types of advertisements, but banning them all would be unwise. The debate about whether advertisements should be banned is complex and draws strong opinions on both sides. On the one hand, it is claimed that advertisements play an important role in promoting competition and consumer knowledge, while on the other hand it is claimed that advertisements lead to negative social effects. Tobacco and alcohol advertisements, for example, are known to have serious effects on public health, especially on young and vulnerable consumers. The proponents of banning advertisements often point to their manipulative potential, because they are often directed at vulnerable groups, for example, young people and people with a low self-esteem, with the intention of encouraging unhealthy habits such as eating junk food and using harmful substances. In addition, advertisements also contribute to the development of a materialistic and consumerist culture where one’s self-esteem is defined by possessions. In this way, advertisements can lead to financial and psychological hardship. A ban would therefore protect consumers from harmful purchases. The benefits of advertisements, however, must not be underestimated. Advertisements inform consumers about new products, services and technological developments and thus promote competition, which in turn means that prices and innovations are lower. Banning advertisements would therefore create a healthier social environment, where well-being is preferred to consumption. More effective would be to regulate advertisements by preventing misleading advertisements, promoting responsible advertising and encouraging transparency. This would alleviate many of the problems and retain the benefits of advertisements. Finally, advertisements can also be powerful tools for social change by promoting ideas such as sustainable development and equality and by encouraging consumers to support worthy campaigns. Advertisements, then, can be harmful, but banning them would be more unwise than regulating them.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;" I believe that exercise, meditation and closeness to nature are the most effective ways of reducing stress. In the busy world in which we live, stress has become an inevitable part of our lives. It is necessary to find a way to relieve this stress and find the time to relax. A brisk walk or a visit to the gym not only distracts us from our everyday worries, but also makes us feel good about ourselves and improves our mood. Exercise is an excellent way to relieve stress. Physical activity releases endorphins - so-called ""happiness hormones."" Meditation and deep breathing also help to relieve stress. I have found that daily jogging improves my mental and physical well-being. Research confirms that regular physical activity reduces anxiety and promotes mental well-being. A regular ten-minute meditation every day can give a sense of peace and clarity. Such practices as meditation and deep breathing help to be in the present and to forget about the past and the future. Nature has a calming effect. A short walk in the countryside has a positive effect on our mood and helps us to calm down. Gardening, hiking and simply spending time in nature can have a very positive effect on our state of mind. In conclusion, there are different ways to relieve the stress of everyday life. I believe that exercise, meditation and closeness to nature are the best. By integrating these practices into our daily lives, we can make ourselves healthier and more able to face life's challenges. I find that working in the garden gives me a sense of closeness to the earth, a sense of pleasure and calm."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject."; To a certain extent I agree with the view that the image has a more powerful role in modern communication, but it is important to emphasize the importance of the written word. In the rapidly changing environment of the Internet, the image, whether it is photography or film, is increasingly overshadowing the written word as the main means of conveying information. Images from historical events, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall or the civil rights movement, have had a much more significant impact on public consciousness than any written report, while a film, for example, is able to immerse its audience in the world of characters and adventures and, as a result, to emotionally touch its audience more than the text. One photo can express emotions and capture moments that words fail to convey. The content in this form is more attractive and engaging, and therefore the ideas can be communicated more widely than in the text. Moreover, the development of social media, such as the platforms of Instagram and TikTok, which place the emphasis on images and short videos, is an indication of a change in the public consciousness towards a visual orientation in communication. However, it is necessary to emphasize the importance of the written word. Literature, academic articles and even well-written social media posts provide complex arguments and allow a deep understanding of difficult issues. Both the image and the text complement each other and emphasize the complexity of communication in our society. In conclusion, although the image is undoubtedly a more powerful tool for communication in the modern world, the written word remains important.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.; With so many languages in danger of dying out, the issue of whether governments should spend money on saving them or not is becoming increasingly relevant. The extinction of languages is an issue of great cultural significance. Keeping these languages alive not only preserves the heritage of the people who speak them, but also strengthens their communities and preserves their diversity. On the other hand, some people think that a waste of public money on saving languages spoken by very few people would be a waste of public money. As the world becomes more and more united through dominant languages like English, the usefulness of saving 'minority' languages is questioned. Critics argue that language preservation is often more an ideological cause than a practical one, and that it should not be favored over other priorities. These resources, they believe, should be used for the needs of the present. But while these arguments may be valid, it is also important to keep the people of the world who speak endangered languages by providing them with resources, and by encouraging them to work strategically to combine education and other socially beneficial goals. In my opinion, although there are arguments against funding the preservation of endangered languages, it is essential that they are saved. Preserving these languages is not just a matter of saving words, but also preserving human cultural diversity and ensuring that future generations can benefit from the cultural heritage they contain. Also, the government should not only spend money on saving the languages of its citizens, but also support the communities that speak them, so that the needs of the local population are met.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.; I disagree. I think the arts and music are extremely important for our society, and we should spend the money on it. First of all, it enhances the culture of the community. People have different cultural backgrounds, and the arts and music can give people the opportunity to know each other. Public music festivals and public art exhibitions give people the opportunity to get together and feel like they belong to each other. Secondly, there are also many mental health benefits. People who participate in creative activities have lower blood pressure and lower the risk of depression. This is also a way to enhance community cohesion and social harmony. Besides, the economic benefits of the arts should not be ignored. Schools that have music and art classes have higher test scores and morale. In addition, there are many other important issues in society that need to be paid, but it is unreasonable to ignore the role of the arts and music in improving the quality of life. There are many jobs in the cultural industry, and the culture industry can also boost the economy and attract tourists. Therefore, I firmly believe that the government should continue to invest in the arts.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.; The government should pay for health care and education, some say. Proponents of this idea say that citizens should have the right to access these essential services, regardless of their financial situation, and that the government should make such a provision to help the most vulnerable among us. Opponents of the provision of free health care and education argue that such a policy will lead to inefficiency and the use of taxpayers' money. By providing access to health care and education, the government improves public health, increases literacy, and encourages an educated workforce, which ultimately contributes to the economy. Some argue that individuals are responsible for their own health care and education. Proponents of this idea argue that a greater variety of health care and educational systems will improve the quality of services and make them more tailored to individual needs. They also say that bureaucratic bureaucracy hampers innovation and responsiveness. This is a problem because the opportunity to receive quality medical care and education should not depend on one's financial situation. This argument suggests that government intervention will lead to the failure of private initiatives and the destruction of private initiative, which could lead to better results in both areas. In my opinion, it is necessary to take into account the disadvantages of government involvement, but I think that the government should take the lead in health care and education. Balanced interplay between public and private initiatives may be the best solution, which would combine the advantages of both. Health and education are necessary for the development of society. Consequently, a government investment in this area is not an expense, but an investment in the social and economic future of the country.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.; I strongly agree that zoos that contain wild animals in a man-made environment should be reviewed or abolished. Zoos are a controversial issue, especially in the 21st century where ethics and animal welfare have become more important. In the 21st century, it is becoming increasingly unjustifiable to keep such facilities that put entertainment before animal welfare. Most zoos fail to provide complex environments for wild animals. The confinement of animals in a small area and cages can lead to psychological problems such as depression and anxiety, which manifests itself in the form of stereotyped behavior. Conversely, those who support zoos claim that they serve as breeding places for endangered species and educate people about conservation issues. But advancing technology offers people a way to learn about animals without hurting them. Virtual reality and augmented reality are available to make people appreciate animals without the need to put them in captivity. In conclusion, although there may be a place for specialized sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers that put animal welfare first, zoos are no longer valid in the 21st century. In the 21st century, animal welfare is the most important in the 21st century, where the well-being of wild animals is the highest value in the world. But reputable conservation organizations emphasize in-situ conservation, protecting animals in their natural environment, rather than relying on ex-situ facilities such as zos.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.; On the one hand, rapid industrialization associated with the pursuit of a higher standard of living often leads to pollution, deforestation and the exhaustion of natural resources. The relationship between industrialization and environment is a vital issue of modern times. The relationship between industrialization and the environment is a topic of today's debate. China and India have become the leading countries in terms of industrialization, but they also suffer from severe pollution, resulting in serious smog and contaminated water. Industrialization, which tends to satisfy the increasing needs of the population, inevitably causes the environment to be harmed. However, it is important to point out that damage to the environment is not inevitable. The development of technology and the increased awareness of sustainable development offer ways for industrialized countries to achieve economic development while protecting the environment. In short, while some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems associated with the pursuit of a higher standard of living, there is no such a problem in the future. On the contrary, it is possible to achieve a balance between economic growth and protection of the environment through the conscious effort of sustainable development and innovation. This is best exemplified by the many Scandinavian countries, which, while maintaining a strong economy, have prioritized the environment through progressive laws and regulations. The responsibility of governments and industries is to adopt the concept of sustainable development and to pursue a policy of prosperity for both people and the environment.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.; To begin with, public services and facilities are the basis of society, providing education, health and security. On the other hand, the government should not ignore the arts, which play an important role in enriching culture and society. Furthermore, the arts can be an economic investment. They provide a nation with its identity, with its history and its stories. Cities known for their culture attract investment, and also the best talent. This is the best way to drive the economy. Besides, the creative industries create jobs, increase the tourist trade and improve the value of real estate. The arts are a way of expressing ideas and encouraging creative thought. Creativity is essential in an ever-changing world, especially with the development of technology. Creativity is a useful skill in the education system, helping students to deal with future problems and to be creative in the workforce. Balanced support for both public services and the arts is not only beneficial, but necessary for the development of a thriving, progressive society.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.; In my opinion, animals should be free. Although zoos argue that they protect and educate animals, the right of animals to live in their natural environment is more important than the need for zoos to protect and educate them. First of all, wild animals are more natural than zoo animals. For example, many elephants in zoos have to experience a lot of stress and boredom due to lack of space and the absence of natural activities. On the other hand, in zoos animals are often kept in enclosures that are too small for them, so they can not walk as they should, and cannot exercise natural behavior. On the other hand, the idea that zoos contribute to the preservation of endangered species is an overestimation, because, although some zoos are involved in the preservation of endangered species, this often does not address the root causes of endangerment, such as loss of habitat and poaching. In addition, these animals are bored and frustrated, and this has a negative impact on their well-being. Besides, there are ways to educate people that do not include captivity. Instead of supporting zoos, it would be better to support nature conservation projects that protect the natural environment and the diversity of species in the wild. In conclusion, despite the arguments for zoos as a means of conservation, the ethical aspects of keeping animals in captivity can not be ignored. Animals have the right to live freely in their natural environment, and we must seek more humane solutions that are beneficial for them. For example, virtual reality and documentaries give people the opportunity to see animals in their natural environment, and so we can promote understanding and empathy for them without having to keep them in captivity.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.; The creative expression of human thought and feelings is the basis of human communication and innovation. I usually agree with the statement that creative artists should generally be allowed to express their ideas as they wish, but I also agree that certain limits should exist in order to protect the common good and to preserve the individual. In the past, art movements, as in the case of Pablo Picasso and films by the director Kubrick, have greatly contributed to the development of society and have often questioned established principles. Art reflects the time and challenges established standards. When a movie is produced that, for example, spreads hatred or promotes violence, it can have a negative influence on vulnerable groups. But absolute freedom can lead to disadvantages. Without freedom to express controversial views, art can become complacent and no longer represent the full spectrum of human experiences. In conclusion, I argue for a significant degree of artistic freedom, because I believe that it is necessary to communicate and to invent. The difficulty is to find the right balance: freedom must not be curbed, but the freedom should not be abused to promote harmful ideas. In such cases, the government should intervene in order to protect the individual and the common good. A society is enriched by many different voices, but it must also protect the well-being and health of its members, and artistic expression must not harm human dignity. A responsible government must guard against abuse of freedom.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.; Advocacy Proponents of advertising claim that it serves essential functions for the economy and society. Proponents of advertising argue that it plays a vital role in our economy and society. Adversaries of advertising claim that it destroys the environment, increases poverty, harms children, and in many other ways. It is the function of advertising to inform consumers about the goods and services they need to make a choice, so they can buy the right product. Competition between producers also brings better quality and new products to consumers. On the other hand, critics of advertising say that it creates materialistic and unreal expectations in people. It often shows people how they should live, which they can not afford, so they feel unhappy. As companies compete for customers, they are forced to develop their products and improve customer service, which benefits consumers. Adversaries of advertising point out that advertising has a hypnotic effect on vulnerable consumers, especially children, who can not distinguish between needs and desires. Then, consumers develop unhealthy shopping habits and excessive consumption of goods and services. For example, the advertisements of beauty products often show people with a flawless appearance, which can lead to negative body images. In my opinion, advertising is a double-edged sword. While it can be used to inform and increase competition, the negative effects of consumers and society must not be ignored. It is important for consumers to be more critical and critical in the face of advertising messages and for governments to monitor the fairness of advertising. I think the best way to use advertising is to use its positive power and avoid its negative consequences.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.; I am against the use of any type of nuclear energy for the production of energy. The argument is that the dangers of such technology outweigh the benefits, especially in the context of the security of energy supply, the environment and the economics of the country. However, it is argued that if the environment is not considered, that the use of such technology is very beneficial to the environment, and that it is a major source of energy in the production of electricity. According to the opponent, unlike other forms of energy such as wind and solar energy, which are sometimes unpredictable, there is always enough electricity to meet the demand, and this also means that the security of energy is increased, which means that the possibility of blackouts is reduced, and the economy is protected from the fluctuations in energy prices. In addition, the use of this technology is very effective and has been proven to be used for a long time. According to the opponent, there are also fears of major accidents and the possibility of the problem of radioactive waste, but the technology has been improved, and many countries have strict regulations on the disposal of such waste. According to the opponent, many countries are aiming for cleaner energy and as they do so, it is very important to invest in this technology, which can help achieve a sustainable energy future and also contribute to the fight against climate change. In conclusion, the benefits of nuclear power, low pollution, stability and efficiency, are far greater than the disadvantages.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.; In your answer, you can assume that access to a mobile phone and the Internet is a kind of power for the unemployed. Although this proposal has attracted a lot of attention, although it is understandable that people who are out of work can be entrusted with such a responsibility and would help them to find a job, I am still not sure that such a single solution can deal with such a complex problem as unemployment. In the era of digital technology, the majority of applications and correspondences are carried out via the Internet, so it is possible that by giving the unemployed access to the Internet, they could find a job faster. There are various training courses, job-hunting tools and social networks available to the unemployed on their mobile devices. There is a strong possibility that a combination of the two, the mobile phone and the Internet, could contribute to the fight against unemployment, but it would not be effective if it did not also deal with deeper problems. However, there are many reasons for unemployment, in addition to the lack of access to new technology, such as the economy, the changing industrial structure, the lack of qualifications, the location of the workplace, etc. Rather than providing a tool for finding a job, the government could spend public money on targeted training courses, mental health services and financial literacy for the unemployed. There is also the problem of government expenditure. To combat unemployment, a comprehensive approach is needed to solve the problem, not just one solution. The conclusion is that it may be useful for the unemployed to have access to a mobile phone and the Internet, but it is not a panacea for unemployment.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.; The arguments for the installation of CCTV in public places, such as streets, stations and shops, often claim that their presence discourages criminals, helps police to solve crimes and makes the public feel safer. Statistics often show that the use of CCTV has reduced certain crimes. As a result, the environment has become safer, especially in large cities where there are more opportunities for criminal activity. The public’s awareness of their presence can lead to them changing their behavior and the feeling of trust towards their fellow citizens is reduced. On the other hand, there are those who argue that the constant surveillance of individuals in public places violates personal freedoms and privacy. In my opinion, the benefits of these devices in the prevention and investigation of crime are undeniable, but they should not override the fundamental rights of citizens in a democratic society. There are also fears that the images recorded by these devices can be misused and that people may have access to personal information without authorization. Incidents of government abuse of power and surveillance, which have been revealed by several privacy campaigners, have demonstrated the delicate balance between public safety and individual rights. An acceptable compromise could be achieved by making sure that the use of CCTV is governed by regulations. These should include a clear policy on data storage, access to the equipment and public information about their locations. In addition, regular inspections could help ensure that they are used for their original purpose - to improve public safety - and respect individual rights. To ensure that public safety and individual rights are maintained, the use of these devices must be carefully regulated.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.; It is possible to give many reasons why it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in the city. For example, it is a much safer and healthier environment for children to grow up in the countryside than in the city. The abundance of natural surroundings and clean air encourage children to move and play, which is necessary for their health and development. It has been shown that children who spend more time in nature are mentally healthier and have a stronger immune system. The contact with animals and plants in nature gives children a feeling of responsibility for them. Moreover, it is more natural for children to live in the countryside, because they become more sensitive to nature and its conservation, and they also become interested in its protection. In contrast, although the city may have more advantages in terms of access to schools, education, and cultural opportunities, it also has many disadvantages such as living costs, congestion, and distractions from education and development. The permanent and overwhelming stimulation of city life may hinder the child's ability to focus and develop personal relationships. Such a connection to the natural environment instills in children a lifelong concern for the environment, which is more important than ever in the world of climate change and anthropogenic destruction. Providing a safe, reassuring, and calming environment for children is a major contribution to their well-being. In conclusion, although there are advantages and disadvantages in both the city and the countryside, I believe that the advantages of living in the countryside, such as the security and health of children and their connection to nature, outweigh those in the city.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities."; Both ways have their advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that, for most people, a position in a company provides a more solid and profitable career path. A position in a company gives a sense of security that is often unattainable in self-employment. The income from a position in a company is predictable and reliable. There are no surprises like a company with its unpredictable income. Opportunities for professional development are also available in the company environment, but are more difficult to find outside of the company. Training, mentorship, and networking all take place within the company, and employees learn new skills and develop their careers. The satisfaction of starting something from scratch and seeing it grow and develop is an undisputed advantage, but the risks are very high. To summarize, although both career paths have their advantages, I think that most people prefer to work in a company. The stability, the professional development and the opportunity to work with others that a company provides offer a more secure and fulfilling career path than self-employment. Approximately 20 percent of small businesses fail in the first year.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";" I absolutely agree with this statement. In the world full of difficulties and obstacles, the ability to resist is not only a virtue, but also the guarantee of success. For example, Thomas Edison, who famously invented the light bulb, failed 10,000 times before he finally succeeded. He had already proved to the world the importance of the tenacity of the light bulb. It is very important for people to persevere in their lives, because in the pursuit of their goals, they are not likely to achieve success in a straight line, and it is necessary to make some changes in the way of thinking and strategy. Without this, many great inventions, great literature and great movements would not exist. If you give up, you will not only miss the opportunity to succeed, but also miss the opportunity to improve. So when we encounter difficulties, we should first evaluate the situation and then persevere. The essence of this sentence lies in the combination of tenacity and agility. There are many times when we have to review our goals and take a different path for our personal growth or survival. So in addition to perseverance, there should be a spirit of innovation and continuous improvement. So the sentence ""Never, never give up"" is not only a reminder of the power of tenacity, but also an urgent reminder of the importance of agility."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.; Human activities, such as agriculture, urbanization and industrialization, have a great influence on the environment. The question of whether the human needs for agriculture, industry and industry should be given priority over the need to protect endangered animal habitats is a contentious one, and requires careful consideration of both sides. The loss of species is one of the main problems of modern society, as the number of wild bees has declined, and the result is that the food chain has been broken. The demand for agricultural land is understandable, but it often leads to deforestation and destruction of natural habitats, driving many species to extinction. However, we cannot ignore the interdependence between humans and wild animals. The healthy environment provides us with a number of essential services such as the removal of smog, the purification of water, and the regulation of climate. So it can be seen that neglecting the needs of endangered animals will eventually lead to harming human interests. For example, it is known that a large number of species can provide the basis for ecotourism and can bring economic benefits to local communities. In conclusion, while human needs are legitimate, they should not be at the expense of the environment. By protecting endangered animals, we are also protecting these essential services for future generations. I believe that the conservation of land for endangered animals should be a major priority in our development policies. The balance is possible between sustainable development and the conservation of endangered animals.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance."; The external appearance, which is the style of clothing, manners and physical features, often represents our first impression of someone else. I agree completely with the statement that one should never judge a person by his external appearance, because that ignores his inner complexity and worth. For example, a person can be dressed and be completely disheveled, but have an extraordinary intellect and kind heart, and a person who is dressed with care and perfection can be prejudiced and full of insecurities. The external appearance does not, however, correspond to the real value, position and ability of a person. In addition, different cultures show individuality and individuality in different ways. Judging by the appearance of people also ignores the difference in the personal stories of each individual. By recognizing people in their true complexity, they are able to be seen as authentic and valuable. On the other hand, superficial characteristics are often associated with success and intelligence, and this criterion is influenced by the changing world order and the prejudices that we have. It is therefore important to be able to appreciate the fact that everyone has a different story that deserves to be respected and acknowledged. Taking the time to understand someone's thoughts, experiences and motivations will lead to a deeper relationship and an openness to others. One will enrich one's life and society by the other person's different personalities and values.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;" Advocates of a single international language argue that such a language would make communication on the international level easier, reduce misunderstandings, strengthen international cooperation, facilitate trade, tourism, diplomacy, etc., and bring people together in one community. There are good arguments on both sides of this debate, which highlights the complex relationship between communication and cultural identity. The opposition raises legitimate concerns about the erasure of cultural identity that could result from a dominant world language. Certainly, language is not only a means of communication; it also embodies history, tradition, the peculiarity of views. In an increasingly interconnected world, an effective means of communication is more necessary than ever, and the use of a single language could facilitate the business, education and technological communication. Yet language embodies the stories, humor, views, values of the nation and individual. Consequently, the use of a single language could reduce the identity of small nations to the level of relics rather than evolving traditions. The disappearance of minor languages and dialects is often a result of the unification of languages and a reduction in the variety of cultural experiences. Instead of imposing a single world language, we should encourage people to learn and use international languages, while preserving their mother tongues, which would not only ensure the effectiveness of communication but also the preservation of cultural diversity. In my opinion, although the introduction of a single world language would have many advantages in terms of convenience and communication, it is important to preserve linguistic diversity. This way we can create a world where linguistic diversity strengthens, rather than weakens the unity of people."
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.; Many people believe that these trends are mainly intended to increase the sales of the fashion industry, rather than to inspire personal style. Especially in today's fast-paced digital world, it is often difficult for individuals to follow what is “in” and what is “out” every week. Personal expression is an important part of identity, and clothes are a powerful tool for expressing ourselves. Many claim that this creates a superficial culture that emphasizes consumption over individuality. I find a lot of merit in the claim that people should dress in what they like and not blindly follow the latest fashion trends. However, there are many other reasons why this is good advice. For example, the fast-fashion business model, which encourages consumers to constantly consume new clothes, is a serious threat to the environment. When we deliberately choose clothes that fit our personality, we are more likely to feel self-confident and more authentic, which often leads to a more meaningful engagement with the world around us, which in turn creates a greater sense of belonging and self-acceptance. In short, while fashion trends can inspire and offer a variety of choices, prioritizing personal preference over temporary trends allows individuals to express their identity more honestly. For many individuals, it may be tempting to follow these changes by regularly replacing their wardrobes, which contributes to the wastage and unsustainable practices of the fashion industry. By resisting the urge to conform to temporary trends, people can adopt a more sustainable and thoughtful approach to clothing, for example, by choosing timeless pieces that fit their unique style. The more individuals adopt a conscious and sustainable approach to clothing, the more sustainable and more authentic the fashion industry will become.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run."; For those who argue that affluent nations should share their wealth, it is a moral duty for them to share with poorer nations, because of their historical injustices, the extreme inequality of their economies, and the increasingly interdependent nature of world economies. The distribution of wealth between rich and poor countries remains a contentious issue in international debates on the concept of justice and equity. The view that it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their own citizens raises several important points. The notion of national sovereignty and self-determination is the foundation on which all national governments are built. By providing food and education, wealthy countries can help to promote sustainable development, and by doing so help to ensure not only immediate relief but also long-term growth and stability. In contrast, there is the possibility that poorer nations may become reliant on assistance from wealthier nations, which may undermine their governance and their efforts to be self-reliant. So the governments of poorer nations must use their own resources and capacities to improve the lives of their citizens, rather than relying heavily on foreign aid. This would make the governments of poorer nations more accountable, while encouraging them to develop a stronger sense of resilience and resourcefulness. This might, therefore, be the best approach to global progress. In sum, while it is important for wealthier nations to help poorer ones deal with the problems of hunger and lack of education, the responsibility for the outcome of such aid lies with the governments of the developing nations themselves. Only through close collaboration between the two can a more just and equitable world be created.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.; I am largely in agreement with this statement for several reasons. The question of how a country should spend its health budget has long been a subject of discussion among policy makers, health workers and the general public. First of all, by increasing the health budget for health education and preventive measures, it can effectively reduce the incidence of infectious diseases. Health education is an important way to inform people about the benefits of a healthy diet and regular exercise, and to educate them about the harms of alcohol and tobacco, so as to improve their behavior, thereby reducing the occurrence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. It is costly to treat these chronic diseases, both for individuals and for the health system. By increasing health education and prevention, the cost of medical care will be reduced over time, which will reduce the burden on hospitals and health care. Reduced resources spent on treatment can make the health system more sustainable and more resources can be allocated to other areas of medical care. However, it should be noted that we must strike a balance. In my opinion, a large proportion of the health budget should be spent on health education and prevention, and sufficient resources should be allocated to health care. Although health education and prevention are extremely important, we cannot neglect the care of the poor and disadvantaged, and therefore we need to review the allocation of resources rather than completely rearranging them. There are three benefits to the overall allocation of resources: the population is healthier, health care costs are reduced, and the economy is more sustainable.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.; I tend to agree that the consequences of such popularity are often detrimental. However, there is a controversy that such influence is a negative development because it is easy to give wrong information, sensationalism and lack of objectivity. In the fight for views and views, various news platforms are more interested in telling sensational stories than the fact of the news. The effect of this is not only distortion of public opinion, but also the spread of mistrust among citizens. Moreover, the emphasis on sensationalism can lead to desensitization. As a result, individuals often find themselves in a maze of different narrators, which makes it difficult to find the truth. This not only affects the mental health of individuals, but also to the apathy towards societal issues. Such continuous exposure to bad news can lead to anxiety and helplessness, which is detrimental to one's health. Thus, the general impact of the popularity of news media can be regarded as a negative development, which requires reflection and reform. In summary, the news media perform an important role in informing the public and holding the power to account, but the media's popularity is often harmful.
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.; The principle that a defendant is entitled to a fair trial, regardless of past offenses, is based on the idea that a person is innocent until proven guilty, and this is supported by the concept of innocence until proven guilty. However, if a defendant is convicted in the past, this information may become available to the jury and it may help them to assess the risk of reoffending, especially in cases where the defendant has been convicted before. However, there are many disadvantages in this. Human psychology is to blame for this: people inadvertently associate previous criminal behavior with guilt, which violates the basic principles of fairness and impartiality, thereby depriving justice of its inherent impartiality. The introduction of such a document may significantly affect the impartiality of the jury, leading to decisions based on previous convictions rather than on the facts of the case. In a word, although this principle may have a positive effect on the possibility of a fair trial, the principal aim of the criminal law system should be to preserve the integrity of the principle of innocence until proven guilty.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.; I would say that these events can have a significant effect on peace and unity. Such occasions, especially prestigious competitions such as the football World Cup, are not just games, they are a cultural phenomenon that can help relieve tensions between nations and allow for a good outlet of patriotic emotions in a safe way. It is possible that during such an event, the feeling of a common, common experience can overcome the national barriers, even between the fans of the competing countries. First of all, these international sporting events create a sense of community. During such competitions, people from various countries get together to celebrate their teams, which creates a feeling of mutual respect and admiration. In addition, such events often promote international co-operation and communication. The World Cup this year, for example, saw a rare moment of solidarity between the fans of the hostile teams, which is unusual in such cases. At the same time, it is important to recognize the limitations of sport as a means of easing international tensions. The Olympic games, for example, are not only a sports event, but also an opportunity for cultural exchange and communication between nations. Besides, countries invest in the organization of these events, and therefore in the economy, diplomacy and tourism, which, in turn, can lead to better relations. These events, therefore, have the potential to serve as a good ice-breaker, but they can also be used for less useful purposes. Sports, as well as friendship, can cause conflict. Fan violence and political protests can obscure the general feeling of community. In the end, however, these occasions can lead to a better understanding between people and nations, but at the same time they bring with them their own problems. In my opinion, although such international sporting events as the World Cup can help to reduce tensions and channel patriotism in a positive direction, it is necessary to remember that they are not a panacea for the world's problems.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.; Some people are completely against any kind of work by children, believing that this is a violation of their right to childhood, education and rest. They argue that children belong in schools, not in the workplace where they can be exposed to exploitation and bad conditions. Opponents believe that work gives children many important skills such as responsibilities, time management and financial management. Research shows that children who work often have to sacrifice their education, which can perpetuate poverty and limit future opportunities. Its impact on physical health, mental health and learning outcomes is clear and alarming. Work can give children a sense of purpose and a sense of belonging, and encourage them to become more resilient and independent. When regulated and in line with their school obligations, these work experiences can serve as a bridge to personal and professional development. Children’s rights should be the priority in any initiatives to protect their well-being and education. When considering both perspectives, it is clear that work experience may have its benefits, but the context is important. The key to resolving this complex issue is to ensure that children have access to safe and meaningful work while protecting their right to education and rest. In conclusion, the question of whether children should work for money is neither right nor wrong in itself, but depends on many factors such as the type of work, working conditions, and how it affects their education and development.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.; The main advantage of such a gap year is the opportunity for personal growth. However, the trend to encourage young people to take a year between finishing school and starting university has both advantages and disadvantages. Working during this period can develop important skills such as financial literacy and job skills, while travelling can enhance a young person’s worldliness and open-mindedness, as well as add to their CV, helping them stand out from the crowd. This is all reflected in the enhanced value of their CVs, which will set them apart from the rest of the students. The advantages are that young people can gain experience, develop independence and self-reliance, and become more confident in tackling new situations and challenges. In addition, this can provide an opportunity to think about and explore their interests and passions. Having left the pressure of examinations behind, they can then focus on one or two areas, making their choice of university course more informed. Nevertheless, the gap year has its disadvantages. One disadvantage is the loss of academic momentum that can result from the absence of a structured, focused life. In addition, financial constraints can limit access to travel or work opportunities, particularly for those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, exacerbating inequality rather than reducing it. In conclusion, while gap years can provide opportunities for personal and educational growth, disadvantages also need to be considered. The decision to take a gap year must be an informed one, in line with a young person’s personal circumstances and goals.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.; I agree to some extent that the qualities necessary for success in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. Success today is more than academic success. Universities and similar academic institutions can provide the necessary knowledge and basic skills, but the qualities needed for success are often beyond the scope of the university's training. For example, the ability to adapt to new technology and changing work environments requires an attitude that focuses on change, and this attitude is honed through practical involvement in various situations rather than through theoretical knowledge. First of all, the ability to cope with the complex challenges of the modern world, such as realism, flexibility and emotional intelligence, is developed in many people through practical experience and not through the theoretical teachings of the university. Furthermore, the ability to act independently, critical thinking and the ability to communicate with others are vital skills that can be learned through internships, voluntary work and other practical experience. Finally, it is important not to underestimate the importance of academic institutions. Knowledge and intellectual skills are the foundation for success in many professions. I believe that while universities provide a lot of valuable knowledge and skills, the personal qualities necessary for success in today's world are often honed by life experiences, practical challenges and social contacts. Success is a multi-faceted concept that includes both academic achievement and personal qualities that are developed outside the classroom.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.; I think this is an idea that should be strongly supported. Firstly, the freedom of deciding when to stop work is a sign of respect for the people themselves and their life. In many people's lives, career fulfillment is closely linked to personal identity and self-worth. If they are forced to stop working, they may feel a sense of boredom, loss of identity and mental depression. Freedom to work can make people stronger and more confident, and more interested in what they do. Secondly, forced retirement is a form of age discrimination against older people, and thereby depriving them of their skills and abilities. Many industries are desperate for experienced workers who can teach younger workers, help to infuse innovation, and guide the company forward. Thirdly, the nature of work has changed a lot over the years. Technological development and changes in the way people work have made it possible for older people to work longer and be competitive. And finally, with the increasing life expectancy of people, a fixed retirement age is becoming less reasonable. There are many people in their sixties who are healthy, energetic and willing to work. If they continue to work, they can not only enrich their lives, but also enrich the company where they work. To sum up, people should be allowed to work for as long as they want to, because this policy shows respect for individual people, gives people the opportunity to use their experience and skills, and fits in with the reality of modern life. I think it is unreasonable and unfair to set a retirement age. The introduction of flexible retirement will help to build a more harmonious and productive workforce.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects."; A few points are made in the debate that museums and art galleries are necessary for a digital world. First, virtual exhibits, although convenient, do not provide the sense of beauty that people can experience when they see art and artifacts in person. An emotional connection can be made with a Van Gogh painting like Starry Night, which a digital image cannot replace. The physical presence of a painting, the texture of a sculpture, the size of an ancient object, cannot be felt except in person. The second point is that museum education is more meaningful than a virtual experience. Physical spaces create a sense of community that the digital world cannot provide. Finally, museums are places for social and cultural exchange. They provide a meeting place for the curious, and stimulate the minds of people of all ages. Many artifacts are sensitive to light and heat and must be preserved. In addition, museums are important in preserving the history of our nation. Digital images cannot protect and protect the physical collection, which is the legacy of the past. Museums must store and show the objects appropriately, which cannot be done in the digital world. Also, museums and art galleries are important places for human interaction. They provide rich, tactile, and memorable experiences, which increase our understanding of human creativity and history.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.; This practice helps to protect the presumption of innocence, a fundamental principle of justice, according to which a person is innocent until proven guilty. Providing juries with information about the defendant's past criminal record could seriously damage this principle and make them prejudiced and biased in their decision. If the jury knew about the defendant's past criminal record, they might be tempted to connect it with the present charge. This would make the jury prejudiced and their decision based on the facts of the past, rather than on the facts of the case itself. This would erode the fairness of the trial. As it is, the system of justice aims at rehabilitate offenders, and the separation of past records from the present charge gives offenders the opportunity to change and be more likely to change their lives, without the fear that their past record will be used against them in the future. If the practice of not allowing juries to have information about the defendant's past criminal record was changed, these principles would be weakened and the fairness of the trial would be damaged. In conclusion, the existing practice of not allowing juries to have information about the defendant's past criminal record is an important part of the fairness of the trial and the presumption of innocence. The idea of changing this practice is unacceptable.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.; This question is debatable. I think the use of the Internet in formal education is a double-edged sword. Firstly, it offers unparalleled access to educational resources, allowing students to go over them again when they want to. It also allows students with different learning styles to access the same quality of education, regardless of geographical constraints. Face-to-face lectures also encourage discussions, critical thinking and immediate feedback, which are often missing in online lectures. However, I am concerned about the reduced importance of face-to-face lectures, as the personal relationship between the teacher and the students is essential to a comprehensive education. The effects of the Internet on future academic study are profound. While it has the potential to simplify the distribution of educational resources, it has also created a problem in maintaining students’ engagement and motivation. Moreover, attending face-to-face lectures develops essential communication skills and opportunities for students’ professional development. In conclusion, while the Internet has greatly increased access to education, I think it should not replace the unique benefits of face-to-face lectures. In the future, as more universities become involved in e-learning, they will need to work out ways of integrating both physical and virtual lectures to maintain a dynamic and effective educational experience.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.; Hundreds of thousands of people die every year from diseases that can easily be treated. The need for medicine in developing countries is a real and urgent need. The question is whether it is right to put profit before human life. The development of drugs and medicines, which is mainly driven by profit, can be made available to people in need, but the high prices often prevent people from getting them, especially in developing countries where the average income is much lower. One solution could be tiered pricing, where the price of medicines varies according to the economic level of the country. Such a system could ensure that the pharmaceutical industry's profits were preserved and that medicines could be made available to the people who most needed it. I strongly believe that pharmaceutical companies should do more to ensure that their products are available to everyone, regardless of their geographical and economic barriers. In other words, they should recognize their social responsibility and take the initiative to help close the gap between rich and poor when it comes to access to health care. Another solution could be to invest in pharmaceutical companies in developing countries, which could contribute to the country's development and at the same time make medicines available. I do not think it is right that people should die unnecessarily because of the lack of access to medicine. As long as this does not change, we in the developed world, which is capable of innovation and humanity, will tolerate this.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.; In recent years, several companies have banned smoking in their offices and many governments have banned smoking in public places. I support this as they make the environment healthier and encourage people to live healthily. Companies that prohibit smoking in their offices not only protect their employees from the dangers of secondhand smoke, but also create a more productive work environment. To begin with, by prohibiting smoking in offices, they improve the environment. For example, according to the latest research, employees who are more healthy and less irritated tend to be more productive and satisfied. On the other hand, governments that ban smoking in public places also play an important role in improving the public's health. The public places such as parks, restaurants, and public transport are now a more comfortable and enjoyable place for everyone. With the changing attitudes of people to smoking, it is important to support the smoking ban to help the public health. Public health education campaigns that advocate against smoking have been successful in reducing smoking rates, which directly contributes to the smoke-free policy. In addition, the ban on smoking also encourages smokers to think about their habits. As smoking becomes more difficult, people tend to stop smoking or reduce smoking, which will have long-term health benefits. It is not only a good habit for a healthy and productive society to consider the health of employees and the public. Finally, it is necessary to restrict smoking in the workplace and public places to make the environment healthier.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life."; In defense of human progress, one can cite the achievements of medical science, which has reduced the mortality rate and lengthened the life of human beings. On the other hand, those who claim that we are damaging the Earth point out the problems of poverty, ignorance, and superstition that have arisen because of human actions. In my opinion, both sides are right. Scientific development and human progress have transformed the face of the Earth, and they have enriched the lives of millions of people. The over-exploitation of the natural resources of the planet, deforestation, the use of chemical fertilizers, and global warming have resulted from these activities, while irresponsible farming practices have led to the loss of water and the exhaustion of the soil. On the other hand, those who claim that our activities are damaging the environment point out that the loss of bio-diversity, the destruction of the natural balance, and the elimination of natural reserves have been caused by our actions. We must find a balance between our ability to enrich our lives and our responsibility to the planet. The Earth’s natural resources are being over-exploited and we are destroying them, threatening the future of the planet. Our work to repair the damage must be a shared responsibility. We must realize that we cannot continue to exist if we continue to harm the planet.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.; For one thing, old people's experience is very useful to the company. The second is that some young people can learn from them. The elderly have a deep understanding of the industry. Many times, they have experienced a lot of changes and challenges in the industry, and have experienced many problems, which can guide the young people and learn from them. It can be said that it can be said to be very helpful for the company. Many times, the company's young and old staff are working together, and there is a great harmony between the two, so the company is more active. Creativity and problem-solving ability are also very good. The team is formed by different ages, and it is easy to have a different view of the issue, and it is very helpful for the company to solve the problem. It is better for companies to recognize the value of their employees, and allow them to do part-time work after they reach the age of 55. It is not only beneficial to the company, but also beneficial to the employees. In addition, if the company insists on mandatory retirement or forcefully retires the old employees, there may be some moral issues. It can also be said that it is very difficult for the company to build a good working environment. In my opinion, instead of encouraging old people to retire, the company should value the contribution of the old employees.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.; In my opinion, the debate over media controls is an important one in today’s digital age, when the media are so readily available and can be used so easily. To my mind, the main principle of democracy is that free access to information is essential. If the media are too strictly controlled they will be unable to fulfil their role as the fourth pillar of democracy and the public debate and democratic decision making will be seriously compromised. Moreover, the level of censorship some people want to see could lead to a climate of fear rather than one of responsible debate. A freer flow of information would allow citizens to form their own opinions, based on the wider spectrum of opinions. This diversity is important for the formation of a healthy society, where a variety of cultural, political and social views co-exist and contribute to the national debate. This is why it is important that people are educated in critical thinking skills so that they can recognise propaganda. On the other hand, a well informed public can challenge injustices and ensure a more positive outcome in political decision making. In my opinion, a balance between free speech and media literacy is the best way forward. Loosening the controls can benefit individuals and democracy as a whole. Rather than imposing stricter controls, governments and educational institutions should prioritise the teaching of critical thinking and the ability to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.; On the one hand, paying taxes is a civic duty, and taxes fund the essential public services such as education, health, roads and security, and thereby serve the public good. Whether paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society or whether citizenship requires more responsibilities is a controversial issue. Some people think that citizenship involves more than paying taxes, that it also involves participating in other public affairs, not just paying taxes. From this perspective, fulfilling tax obligations is a significant part of the social contract, and fulfilling tax obligations is the most basic way in which citizens participate in the social contract, contributing to the welfare and development of their communities and nation. In my opinion, citizenship requires more responsibilities than just paying taxes. Citizenship responsibilities involve participating in local government, voting, being involved in the public life, advocating social issues and strengthening community bonds. The participation of citizens in public affairs encourages leaders to be accountable and responsive, and citizens to be able to express their views and priorities. Citizenship involvement can influence the policy and ensure that the needs of the community are met. While paying taxes is essential, it does not fully reflect the essence of community. A responsible citizen recognizes that taxes are an important aspect of the social contribution, but civic engagement contributes to the formation of a more vibrant, equitable and just community. In the end, paying taxes and participating in public affairs are complementary to each other and form a more perfect community.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;" I strongly support the idea that the use of animals in experiments is unethical. This argument has long been a contentious issue among scientists, ethicists and animal activists. It is a matter of anthropocentrism to believe that animals are only there for human use, which ignores the intrinsic value of other living beings. Like humans, animals are conscious creatures and are subject to suffering, pain and distress; it is cruel to subject them to a series of painful procedures, a life of confinement and the suffering of experimentation. For another thing, scientific research is constantly changing, and as new technology is developed, new, effective ways to test have been developed that no longer require the use of animals. In a morally correct society, laws and regulations should reflect human morality, and as our knowledge of animal sentience increases, so it becomes increasingly clear that the use of animals in experiments is morally wrong. Furthermore, animal experiments are not very reliable. In vitro testing, computer simulations and organ-on-a-chip technology are some of the methods that can replace animal experiments and are not only free from the ethical problems associated with animal use, but also often provide results that are more applicable to human biology and therefore increase the relevance and success of medical research. And, indeed, a great many drugs that have been tested on animals and passed fail in human trials, either because they are not safe or because they are ineffective. Not only is this ethically wrong, but also scientifically unsound and wasteful, with potentially serious consequences for human health. In conclusion, the use of animals for experiments should be made illegal. A humane and progressive society should take into account the ethical and moral interests of all creatures, even in its pursuit of scientific progress. With the emergence of new, more accurate methods of testing and the questionable reliability of animal experiments, it is time for a radical change in scientific research."
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";" However, standardized tests, in my opinion, are not the best way to assess educational achievement. Examinations have long been the mainstay of assessment in education. However, this has been questioned more and more, and people have come to question the value of a system based on “pen and paper” examinations. It is quite obvious that a student who excels in practical thinking and practical collaboration and who is able to think outside the box cannot excel in a timed test. This is because the test emphasizes the recollection of information and the stress of it. It ignores skills such as creativity, problem solving and the ability to apply knowledge in the real world. Students may find that they have to memorize a lot of material to get through the test, but once the test is over, they have forgotten most of what they have learned. Moreover, the reliance on ""pen and paper"" examinations leads to a reliance on recollection rather than understanding. In my opinion, a system based on examinations can only have a limited effect on students' achievements. If teachers allow other forms of assessment such as projects, oral presentations and group work, it will be more equitable and will also encourage a more diverse educational environment. It should also be noted that students have different learning styles, so it is difficult to give a grade to everyone. The use of different assessment methods will give a more accurate assessment of educational achievement and also prepare students for the complexity of modern society. In conclusion, although standardized examinations may be a way of examining the skills and knowledge of students, they cannot always reflect the full range of the student's learning."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.; Interdependence in the global economy and moral obligation of the wealthier nations force them to be more involved in helping their less developed counterparts. Often the development of the poorer countries is blocked by historical injustice, unequal economic conditions and systemic injustice. These conditions should be reversed. In the field of health, the wealthy nations can invest in building health centers, transferring medical knowledge, and providing medical resources such as medicines and vaccines. Health is an important factor in sustainable development because it is a major obstacle to productivity and a major cause of poverty. In the same way, education is the key to enabling individuals and changing societies, and the richer nations can also help with such initiatives. These activities not only help the health of the citizens of poorer countries, but also contribute to international solidarity and cooperation. This makes the global community more prosperous. Similar developments can be achieved in the field of trade. In this field, the richer countries can provide scholarships for students from poorer countries, increase teacher training, and share teaching methods and educational resources. In the field of trade, the richer countries can reduce tariffs, remove restrictive regulations, and support the development of the local industry in the poorer countries. In short, the responsibility for helping development should not only lie with the poorer countries. As the developed countries participate more in the development of the poorer countries, they can not only meet their moral obligations, but also contribute to a more equitable and prosperous global community.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.; There is no doubt that technology plays an important role in education today, but it is difficult to replace the teacher completely. For example, teachers offer a unique human element that cannot be replaced by technology. A computer program can deliver the information, but it cannot respond to the student's difficulties and achievements, both of which are essential to a good education. Teachers are not only a source of information, but also mentors, support, and inspiration. Moreover, the teachers are also the leaders in building the classroom community. They can help students learn how to work together, get along with each other, and deal with the student's social and emotional needs. These are very important life skills, which can not be developed through computer-based learning alone. While the technology can enhance the educational experience and provide a broader platform for students to access, and provide students with the opportunity to learn individually, it is a useful tool, but it is not a substitute for teachers. This is the fact. In conclusion, the development of education is an inevitable trend, and the role of teachers should be changed and improved rather than decreased.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.; - Improved fertilisers, especially synthetic, have completely changed how we produce food. Agricultural progress through the use of improved fertilisers and advanced machinery has increased food production and reduced costs. However, the benefits of such progress are accompanied by danger for human health and harmful effects for local communities. On the surface, it would appear that the technological progress is a win-win situation for both the producers and consumers. They have introduced improved fertilisers, which have improved the nutrition of plants and therefore increased yields, and at the same time have reduced costs and labour, which is good for both producers and consumers. However, the dangers of such fertilisers for human health are considerable. They leach into the groundwater and contaminate the drinking water, causing diseases such as cancer and lung disease. The development of agricultural machinery has also had a negative effect on local communities. The development of machinery has led to the disappearance of manual labour, which has resulted in the disappearance of small farmers and a reduction in rural welfare. Algae blooms also disrupt the aquatic environment and may also produce toxins that are dangerous for people and animals. Progress in agriculture requires a balance between the interests of all parties, especially to protect the health of humans and the environment. Progress in agriculture is only a positive thing if it benefits everyone without compromising health and the environment. In conclusion, improved fertilisers and better machinery have increased food production and reduced costs, but with considerable risks for human health and local communities.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.; If you agree, write why. First, art plays a very important role in cultural identity and expression. Although the government should certainly allocate money to areas such as health care, education, and public works, I think it is also important to support the arts. This is because the cultural and artistic background of a city is a major part of the country's pride, and art is also a major tourist attraction. For example, famous art cities like Florence and Paris receive millions of tourists each year, bringing great economic benefits to the area. Artistic thinking promotes the development of new ideas and entrepreneurship, which helps the economy and employment. Secondly, art is an important part of innovation and creativity in all industries, such as technology and education. On the other hand, some people argue that the government should use the limited resources to deal with urgent social issues such as poverty and epidemics. However, it is also true that a flourishing artistic culture can effectively solve these social issues. For example, the gaming industry, which is rooted in artistic talent, is now one of the world's most prosperous industries. Moreover, through artistic creation, the government can stimulate innovation and creativity, and solve social problems. In my opinion, the government should invest in art not as a luxury, but as a necessity. The key to a prosperous society is the balance between the needs of art and the needs of the people.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.; In the past decade, the rapid development of technology has brought many improvements in people's lives, and at the same time, it has also brought a lot of problems. There are two main views to solve these problems: one is to simplify people's lives, and the other is to develop technology. The first view advocates a return to nature and the past, a sustainable relationship with the environment. The ways to simplify the life of individuals are to reduce the waste of food, reduce the use of energy, and increase the use of local products. Many people argue that the problem is not solved by technology, but technology itself. They say that the use of technology can reduce emissions and save resources. Moreover, the development of waste disposal technology and carbon capture technology can solve the problem of resources and emissions in the past. In my opinion, we should take a balanced approach. Both methods should be used to ensure sustainable development. Although living a simple life can solve many of the problems of the environment, we must use technology to solve the problems of the environment, and the two methods can be combined. There will be a lot of technology.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.; A major reason for the disparity in salaries is the nature of the entertainment industry and professional sports: these industries are built on popularity and on commercial sponsorships. Many people believe that the millions of dollars that football stars, singers and actors earn are excessive and that it is a great injustice when compared with the salary of teachers, nurses and other essential employees. There are several reasons for this. For example, the National Football League (NFL) generates billions of dollars in revenue every year, and stars such as Tom Brady or Peyton Manning bring in huge numbers of fans and are therefore valuable assets to their teams. The question that raises is whether the entertainment industry should be given priority over the public services. How can we ensure that we value all the professions equally? For example, in the United States a teacher with a lot of experience earns around fifty thousand dollars a year. This salary is a far cry from the incredible pay of a star such as Patrick Mahomes, who recently signed a ten-year contract worth four hundred and fifty million dollars. Further, our glorification of celebrities is exacerbating this disparity. When the public begins to demand more and more entertainment, the salaries of sportspeople and entertainers rise accordingly. On the other hand, essential workers such as nurses and paramedics, who work in the most difficult circumstances and who have to cope with long working hours, often at great personal sacrifice, continue to be paid relatively low salaries. Talent and charisma deserve to be rewarded, but people are still arguing that the salaries of sportspeople and entertainers are out of all proportion, especially when compared with the salaries of essential workers. Though they provide cultural experiences and entertainment, their inflated salaries give rise to concerns about misplaced priorities and a neglect of more important professions.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.; Many people think that children can learn more effectively at home by using the Internet and other digital learning devices. Compared to traditional schools, there are many more possibilities for learning. They also have more time to learn at home and be more independent. In contrast, the support for the importance of teachers and a formal learning environment is based on the importance of developing children's personalities and developing their full potential. Moreover, technical skills are considered to be more and more necessary in modern life, and this makes learning the Internet an indispensable part of learning. Teachers are also trained to identify individual strengths and weaknesses and teach them in ways that the Internet and artificial intelligence cannot. School provides more than just knowledge and content. Social skills, emotions and group work are also necessary for the future. The e-learning environment can be a supplement to the curriculum, but it cannot replace the full developmental value of teachers and schools. A combination of both e-learning and formal learning is needed for a well-rounded education. In my opinion, both are needed for a good education. Learning from both the Internet and teachers will give students the skills and knowledge they need to survive in the digital age, and still retain human values.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence."; Advocates of capital punishment argue that its existence deters violent crimes and murders. Those who are against it, cite the example of some victims who were treated cruelly and are unwilling to die, and claim that it is inhumane and ineffective. Historical data often shows a positive relationship between the introduction of capital punishment and a decrease in the number of murders, although it is not known how to prove this relationship. Those who support the death penalty argue that the fear of a fatal consequence for criminals prevents them from committing murders. However, many factors that can lead to criminal behavior, such as social status, mental health, education and other social conditions, are not solved by the threat of the death penalty. Also, there is the danger of erroneous verdicts, which also causes moral dilemmas. And the focus on capital punishment can detract from other ways of preventing violent crimes, such as education, mental health care and socially beneficial initiatives. It is possible that the life of an innocent person will be taken unjustly, which is a risk society cannot afford. In conclusion, capital punishment has its supporters who are convinced of the deterrent value of the death penalty for violent crimes, but the evidence suggests that it is not a panacea. It is better to focus on the fundamental causes of violent crimes than to rely on the death penalty.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.; As the statement of this problem is contentious, and as a result, it can be approached from several perspectives. While profit is indeed a primary goal for any business, the way to achieve it is important and should be carefully weighed against ethics, social responsibility and long-term efficiency. It is argued that successful companies often bring the economy, new jobs and the development of technology through the profits they have earned. Profit is also important for the long-term stability of the company, for the payment of salaries and for research and development. But companies that focus on maximizing profits often use exploitative methods, pollute the environment and deceive consumers. These ways of thinking may undermine the public's trust and damage the reputation of the company. Then, in addition to the satisfaction of the employees and customers, companies that act in a more socially responsible way also have a better reputation. It is not surprising that many people want to support companies that demonstrate integrity and social responsibility. In short, although profit is an important objective for business, it should not be pursued at the expense of ethical principles and social responsibility. Such companies create a positive circle in which ethics and profits can coexist, which ultimately contributes to a healthy economy and society.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.; First of all, the new high school can make room for the existing school and reduce the crowding. The second reason is that education is an important cornerstone of community development, and a high school is an opportunity for students to enrich the quality of education. The third reason is that the new high school can help to solve the serious problem of crowded classrooms and fewer teachers, and this will definitely promote the development of students. The fourth reason is that the new high school will create a stronger sense of community. As more teenagers are going to school nearby, the parents and local residents will take part in the school's activities, such as sports and academic competitions, and the families of the students will have a close relationship, which will be beneficial to the students' study and growth. In a word, I think the new high school is a good thing for our neighborhood. The fifth reason is that a high school can also have close ties with local businesses and organizations, which can provide internships for students and help them learn from their practical skills. Supporting this plan is to give our young people the resources they need to succeed.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.; For me this is a difficult question, but I will disagree with this statement in a way, because in my opinion there are valid reasons for both sides. First of all, it is a critical period for the development of a personality. Secondly, the teenager, although he still lives at home, has to learn to be independent and critical and to be able to think independently. By giving the adolescent the freedom to make decisions, even if it leads to mistakes, you teach him invaluable lessons for life. This is the time when the adolescent is forming his values and beliefs, so if his parents or adult relatives make important decisions for him, he loses his critical thinking ability and the ability to take responsibility for his actions. In addition, society is changing and moving forward, and adolescents must be able to make independent decisions in the new situation. This stage is a must for confidence and for preparing for life in adulthood. On the other hand, it is the parents who play an important role, because they have more life experience and they have more experience, which is useful in making decisions. The more decisions the teenager makes, the more he will learn to make decisions and become stronger and stronger, which is necessary for the later development of the personality and for success in further studies, work and in personal life. The conclusion is that parents must help their teenagers make decisions, but it is better for their development to give them freedom to make decisions. In this sense, it is more about consultation than supervision, so that parents help their children, but do not prevent them from making decisions themselves. This helps the teenagers to develop more responsibility and self-confidence and to face the world of adults.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.; I partly agree with this statement, because childhood can indeed be a time of unparalleled joy and innocence, but this does not apply to all. Although childhood is often considered the happiest time of a person's life, there is nothing inhuman about human life, which is complex. The world is their playground, and children are able to enjoy the simple joys of childhood: playing outside, meeting new friends, discovering the beauty of nature. The main thing about childhood is the child's imagination. In childhood, children have few responsibilities and no adult worries, so they consider this time as a carefree period. But it is important to understand that not all childhood is happy. Children are often exposed to poverty, violence and family disruption, which can seriously affect their mental health and future careers. Many children have to deal with poverty, violence and family problems during their early childhood. For these children, childhood is often associated with challenges, not with happiness. Happiness is subjective, and childhood experiences vary greatly from one person to another, making it difficult to determine whether childhood is the happiest time of life. In short, although childhood can be a time of innocence and joy, it is also a time of shadows, and each child's life is different.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.; First of all, many students attend college and university for the sake of learning. There are many reasons why people attend college and university, and they all reflect their individual aspirations, ambitions and life circumstances. Generally speaking, there are three main reasons why people attend college and university: learning, career development and personal development. For example, a student who is passionate about the environment may go to university to study the environment, the issues of climate change and the conservation of the environment. Students who attend college and university have access to a wide variety of subjects, expert teachers and academic support materials, which are conducive to intellectual growth. For many jobs, it is necessary to learn special knowledge and obtain qualifications, for example, medical, legal and teaching professions require graduates to obtain professional licenses and work in their fields. Second, career development is an important reason why people attend college and university. Colleges and universities provide opportunities for students to develop their careers and develop emotionally and socially. Moreover, college graduates are often the minimum requirements for employment, so if they want to find a stable job and earn a high salary, they must first obtain a bachelor's degree. Next, the diversity of college and university life gives students opportunities to understand different cultures and different social issues. For example, a student who is active in the debate club develops their communication skills, but also learns to be more empathetic and take on social responsibilities. Students who are active in extra-curricular activities learn how to work with others, be responsible and manage time. People attend college and university for a variety of reasons, which not only show the many benefits of college and university education, but also demonstrate the importance of college and university education in the professional development and personal development of people.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.; I agree that it is better to have a few close friends than to have many casual acquaintances. I agree because of the emotional intimacy, the support from each other, and the quality of the relationship between people. Friendship has long been a subject of debate, and people often wonder if it's better to have a few close friends or many casual acquaintances. However, I would like to argue that it is better to have a few close friends because they have a deeper emotional bond with each other. When friendship is truly intimate, people can share their thoughts, fears, and aspirations with each other without fear of being judged. When you feel so safe and vulnerable, you can understand each other deeply. Close friends also provide more support than casual acquaintances. It is so important to have someone to help you in your difficult times, but if you are familiar with casual acquaintances, the relationship may be shallow and therefore unable to support you in the face of difficulties. With close friends, however, you can have deeper conversations and share experiences, and you will be more connected to a deeper friendship. Close friends can support you with more patience and guidance than casual acquaintances, who may lack the commitment and understanding to support you. Life is richer and deeper because of the friendship of good people, and good people will support your mental and emotional health. In conclusion, although people have different relationships with their neighbors, the intimacy, support, and satisfaction of one or two close friendships far outweigh the benefits of the relationships with many acquaintances.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned."; First, the revolution in technology has made life easier and more convenient. Secondly, the way we live and work has changed a lot, and in the third place, the change in medical care and the change in society has also greatly changed our lives and made our lives more convenient. For example, the way people communicate with each other is very different. My grandparents only had letters and ordinary telephones, and the replies were usually delayed for a week or two. Now we have smart phones, the Internet, and so on. People can talk to each other at any time, no matter where they are. And the way people communicate with each other has also greatly improved their relationship. In addition, social changes have made people's lives easier and more convenient. For example, because of the improvement of public health measures and the use of vaccines, many infectious diseases that my grandparents suffered from as children have greatly declined. So there is a greater degree of security for people's health. In short, life today is more convenient and easy than that of my grandparents. For example, there has been a significant change in the roles of men and women, and a greater opportunity for education and employment, which has made people more diversified and free. These changes not only enhance the quality of our lives, but also make us more healthy and happier.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.; In this increasingly specialized age, the opportunity to study subjects that inspire and motivate can inspire greater interest in learning and lead to more enthusiasm. High school students are indeed allowed to choose courses. It recognizes students' different interests and talents, and thus makes a more personal and exciting learning experience. If students are allowed to choose their own courses, they will take greater responsibility for their own learning, and their minds will become more critical and clear. One of the most important advantages of allowing students to choose their own courses is that they encourage students to be more independent and responsible. Also, when students study the subjects they are interested in, they will have a better foundation for their future careers. Students who study what they are interested in will usually do better in the course, and will feel more satisfied with their achievements. Although students should be able to explore their interests, it is important that they also have the foundation of basic subjects such as mathematics, natural science, and humanities, which are required to develop their core skills. A student who is interested in biology and chemistry, for example, can also benefit from a course in political science, and this can help him in his future studies and future careers. A combination of these two ways of teaching will prepare students for higher education and future careers, and is a necessary change in educational practices. In conclusion, allowing high school students to choose their courses can help them to be more motivated and responsible learners.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible."; I believe that a slower pace of life has many advantages and is much better for one's mental health and well-being than a fast pace of life. In today's world, people are in a hurry to meet their goals and goals, attend meetings and meetings, and finish their work. There are also people who like to do these things, and they like to work hard and get the energy from a busy schedule. When I walk alone in the park, for example, I feel that the slower I walk, the more I can see the world. When I'm in a hurry, I often ignore the beauty of a flower blooming, a child laughing, and a beautiful sunset. In addition, a slow pace of life allows us to practice mindfulness and reduce stress. I saw families playing, painters painting, and birds chirping. These small pleasures add joy to life and make people happy, but they will be missed if people are in a hurry. By taking the time to reflect on the things we have done and relax with reading or meditation, we will have the time and space to be refreshed. The power of being able to experience the world and its beauty gives people the clarity of mind to deal with difficulties and difficulties. Is it possible to cultivate the relationship with the people around me, share the joy of simple conversations and the joy of eating together, and develop our emotional well-being. Moreover, the slower pace of life makes people get to know others more deeply. Is it possible to develop our relationship with the people around us and lead a more meaningful life? In short, while some people are in a hurry, I would like to encourage others to take the time to experience life and enjoy the beauty of life.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.; On the one hand, the economic benefits of tourism are unquestionable. It creates a lot of jobs, and its revenues are very important for the local, regional and national economy. However, despite the benefits, tourism can also cause a lot of damage to the local environment and culture, and this is an important issue. In addition, tourism promotes intercultural exchanges between tourists and locals, which can be beneficial for a better understanding between people from different cultures. Many countries are highly dependent on tourism as a major source of revenue, which makes it possible to maintain and develop local infrastructure, public services such as health and education, and develop education. On the other hand, mass tourism can be very harmful to the environment. It often leads to overcrowding, which can cause increased pollution, loss of habitat and natural resources. In addition, it is important to keep a balance between economic interests and preservation of the local environment and culture. There is also a risk of losing the local cultural identity, which is largely based on its own local customs and traditions, which are changed and adapted for tourist purposes. For this reason, it is important to promote sustainable tourism, which respects local traditions and the environment, so that it does not deprive the local economy of its benefits.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.; It is an important issue to allocate public funds to the arts and public services. Although it is generally agreed that the public sector should receive priority for government funding, it is also generally agreed that the arts should be funded to a considerable extent. First of all, public services are undoubtedly important for people's well-being. Secondly, public services are irreplaceable for people's well-being. But the statement that public arts funding is a waste of money is a serious misunderstanding. Public art provides people with opportunities to develop creativity, explore different cultures and develop critical thinking. If people have enough opportunities to experience the arts, they will be better equipped to develop critical thinking, creativity and other aspects of life. As a result, it will benefit the local economy. The development of the arts can also have a positive effect on the economy of the country as a whole, which is beneficial to the local economy. The arts also act as a mirror to reflect social issues, so as to explore people's feelings and complex social issues, and lead people to think, talk and reflect, and enrich the nation's common cultural life. In conclusion, although public services should receive priority, the arts also deserve a considerable amount of public funds. Supporting both will enable a well-rounded, inclusive, tolerant and thriving community. The public sector is not a waste of money, but an investment in society.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves."; Now that the world is more and more interconnected, there is no longer a single way to earn money and be happy. The rapidly changing face of work and the ways in which we live are leading to the emergence of many different career paths, and this is not necessarily bad. Job titles that exist today may well be extinct within a few years, and the ability to adapt and to take on new roles and responsibilities will become a necessity. The evolution of industries, driven mainly by technological advances, is one of the main reasons for this change. The emergence of the “gig” economy is another example of how we now have a viable alternative to the traditional way of working. This has led to the expectation that workers develop a range of skills which they can use in different areas, and to a more flexible way of working. People might, for instance, work as a developer of computer programs during the week and pursue their passion for photography at the weekend. Not only does this ensure that they have more opportunities to earn money, but it also gives them the chance to develop a wider range of interests. This type of approach promotes adaptability and personal development, which are exactly what the workforce of the future demands. Another important aspect of this change is the concept of lifelong learning, which allows people to develop new skills and knowledge. In today’s fast-moving world, this offers exciting opportunities for personal and professional development. In conclusion, the idea of a single career is becoming an increasingly old-fashioned one, and the new trend is to have several careers and to keep learning all your life.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.; This task is an example of an ongoing debate about the place of computers in today's society. People have many different opinions about the usefulness of computers and the extent to which they have become indispensable. Some people believe that it is impossible to imagine a time when there were no computers, that they are an indispensable part of everyday life and work. Others argue that they can not imagine working without them, and that the frequent presence of a computer at work leads to an unhealthy work-life balance and makes it difficult to distinguish between personal and professional time. However, others would like to mention the fact that many students today have access to more learning resources and information than they could ever have imagined, and that schools could not have done without it. In my opinion, although it is important to take account of the disadvantages of using a computer, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. The ability to work together on digital platforms promotes collaboration and innovation, illustrating the importance of technology for a collective increase in productivity. So, rather than rejecting technology, we should try to integrate it into our everyday lives with care. In this way, it can be ensured that the individual will be able to handle it in a healthy and productive way.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.; The importance of social skills in the workplace continues to be controversial. On the one hand, many employers value the ability to communicate effectively, work together, and adjust to social situations, which is of utmost importance in fostering a good work environment. Social skills promote teamwork, improve customer relations, and build a company’s culture. On the other hand, some employers still emphasize the importance of qualifications and technical skills. Formal education and certifications are seen as indicators of a candidate’s knowledge, expertise, and ability to perform specific tasks. In positions that require constant contact with people, such as sales or customer service, social skills are just as, if not more, important than academic achievements. In my opinion, however, the importance of qualifications should not be underestimated. In certain fields, such as engineering, medicine, and finance, advanced qualifications are necessary to ensure that employees meet industry standards and regulations. So, rather than looking at qualifications and social skills as competing priorities, employers should view the two as complementary attributes. Since the modern workplace is increasingly characterized by collaboration, an employee’s ability to work together and cooperate effectively is more likely to contribute to the company’s success. For this reason, the combination of qualifications and social skills will produce a workforce that is not only skilled but also flexible and able to work in changing environments.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.; Proponents of giving aid to people all over the world believe that, since poverty and suffering exist in every corner of the world, it is a moral duty to help people in need, no matter where they are. The debate about whether charity organisations should give their help locally or worldwide has been a controversial issue for many years. In an interconnected world, people are encouraged to see themselves as part of a single global community, where need must be prioritised over nationality. Those who favour local charities focus their efforts on local problems. In this way, a sense of solidarity and compassion is promoted, and people are made to understand that disasters, such as war and famine, have no national boundaries. Also, local charities stimulate the local economy, create employment, and foster a sense of community. Local charities are better placed to understand the social and cultural aspects of the communities they serve, and are better able to give their help, because they are so much more aware of the problems faced by their fellow citizens. For example, while issues such as climate change, disease, and human migration must be addressed on an international scale, the problems in our own backyards are very immediate and need to be addressed without delay. So, to my mind, the best approach is a balanced one, which encourages both local and international support. In this way, the problems of the world can be tackled at both ends, ensuring a more complete and ethical approach to the relief of suffering.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.; I strongly agree that students learn more from lessons with teachers than from other sources. First of all, the teachers provide the learning process that is often tailored to the students' needs. The teachers are skilled in simplifying complex topics and in using various teaching methods to meet the different learning styles of students, which enables them to learn effectively. On the other hand, the teachers organize their knowledge and show the learning material in a coherent and structured way, which is in line with the goals of the curriculum. In addition, in the classroom, students have the opportunity to ask questions, discuss and work together. This kind of active interaction is not often found in passive learning such as watching TV or searching the Internet, where the feedback is limited and the students are less aware of the subject. It is precisely the personal relationship between the teachers and the students that creates the nourishing environment for the students' academic and emotional growth. Finally, the teachers are not only content experts, but also role models and mentors. Through their guidance and encouragement, the students are encouraged to pursue their interests and to overcome the difficulties. I therefore strongly agree that students learn more from teachers than from other sources. In conclusion, although the Internet and television can be supplementary resources, they do not have the qualities of personal, structured and active interaction of teacher-led classes. These personal, lively and committed teachers are essential to the students' academic and personal development.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs."; I largely agree with this statement for several reasons. First of all, such international sporting events are a universal platform where peoples of different nations gather together, although in a spirit of competition. In this way, they are able to embrace different cultures, share experiences and views, and thus make an effort to achieve unity. For example, the football World Cup unites people from all over the world in a shared experience that rises above political and cultural barriers. Symbolically, it reveals the shared goals and values of humankind. Furthermore, international sporting events often help people to forget about the international tensions that exist at any given time. For example, at the Olympic games, countries that have conflicting relations among themselves forge together in the spirit of sporting competition. That interaction humanizes the participants, reminds us that people from different countries share the same aspirations and hopes. Besides, sports are a good opportunity to talk to each other about shared interests. Also, by encouraging people from different nations to interact in a positive way, they can create a peaceful world. To sum up, even though international sporting occasions are unlikely to resolve deep-seated conflicts, they can be an environment where international tensions can be eased and patriotic emotions can be expressed safely.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.; In this task, I think both of them are useful, but I think that the advantages of distance learning are greater than those of the college and university. In the last few years, distance learning has been a very popular way of learning because of its convenience and convenience. But it is also a question of how effective it is. This essay will show that it is more effective than college and university. One of the main advantages of distance learning is its accessibility. Students can learn at their own pace and in their own free time, which is particularly useful for people who are working or having families. Distance learning also uses modern technology to make the study environment more dynamic, which is conducive to better learning. In addition, because of the abundant resources available on the Internet, such as lectures, supplementary materials and discussion rooms, students can freely tailor their learning methods. And it is also necessary to see the shortcomings of distance learning. It is difficult for students to learn communication skills in a group environment, which are often developed in traditional learning institutions. However, the globalization of learning makes the views of people from different cultures and backgrounds closer, which also helps to enrich the overall learning. But for some people, the advantages of personal contact and the socialization of college students are more important, which is also the case for those who are unable to learn in person. Moreover, the motivation and discipline of the students are difficult to get rid of in the classroom. But the choice of the best way to learn should be based on individual circumstances and learning preferences, and the two ways have their own advantages.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.; The views on this issue are very different, but both views should be considered. The human-animal relationship is complex. On the one hand, endangered species bring us a lot of benefit in terms of medicine, food, water, etc., on the other hand, many of these animals are useful to us. Supporters of preserving endangered species argue that losing diversity of life would threaten the balance of the natural world. Each species has its own role in the food chain, and the disappearance of a species can cause food chains to break and the environment to degenerate. People who advocate more resources for human problems argue that we should focus on the most urgent issues such as poverty, education and health, rather than endangered species. However, protecting endangered animals is also a moral responsibility. Humans have destroyed most of their natural habitats, caused climate change and destroyed natural water and land resources, so we should not only consider it an ecological necessity, but also an ethical responsibility. Many people argue that as human populations continue to increase, the interests of endangered animals should be put on the backburner, and the immediate needs of human beings should be given priority. The more they argue, the more people they argue. To my mind, both arguments have some merit, but I think we need a balanced approach. If we use environmentally friendly technology, it is possible to meet human needs and protect animal species. There is no doubt that the survival of human beings and the survival of the environment are closely related. Therefore, it is imperative to find a balance between the survival of human beings and the survival of the environment.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.; On the one hand, a similar number of male and female students on university entrance promotes gender equality and gives women equal opportunity in fields where they have been underrepresented historically, such as in technology and in information technology. On the other hand, there are also some problems with this principle. On the one hand, equal numbers of male and female students in all subjects might be a denial of the fundamental principle of meritocracy. On the other hand, a balanced atmosphere in the university will help to reduce existing gaps in society and create a greater variety of opinions and more creative thinking in both professional and academic areas. Also, some subjects naturally attract one gender because of cultural, social or individual preferences. The decision on admission should be based on the individual qualifications, interests and abilities, and not on a strict quota. In the end, a quota for equal numbers of male and female students in all subjects is not necessarily the most effective and useful method. It would be more useful to have a more diverse and inclusive attitude to increase the participation of underrepresented groups without compromising the academic values.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent."; I completely agree with this statement, first of all because of its immediacy, its emotionality, and the fact that it enables true connection. In the age of digital communication, the debate whether face-to-face communication is superior to other means such as letters, emails or phone calls is becoming more and more relevant. These channels do not provide the same immediacy, clarity, and emotion as real-time communication. In real-time conversations, one can immediately clarify any misunderstandings or clarify any ambiguities that may arise, and nonverbal communication such as facial expressions and gestures can play an important role in the communication process, adding additional meaning to the spoken words. As one is talking with a person, one enters a common space that goes beyond words, one can sense empathy and understanding for the other and one can find mutual support. The emotional depth of real-time communication is unique, and one's presence alone can create a deeper and more intimate bond between two people. In addition, face-to-face communication allows for better brainstorming and cooperation, because when people get together in person, the synergy of ideas is more natural. The opposite is the case with phone calls or emails: without the visual and tactile elements, one can misinterpret emotions and intentions more easily. To be able to communicate in real time with a person creates a better understanding between people, and stronger relationships and more effective cooperation. In short, although digital communication is a convenient option, it is inferior to the immediacy, clarity, and emotional depth that face-to-face communication offers. The immediacy of this communication leads to creativity and innovation that are often lacking in the slower written word. In an increasingly virtual world, I therefore advocate for an increase in face-to-face communication.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.; On the one hand, longer life gives more experience. Longer life is a consequence of improved medical care, a sign of the development of science and technology, but it is important to analyse whether the disadvantages of this development outweigh the advantages. Having a longer life not only enriches the lives of individuals but also enriches society because the experience of people has a social value. An older and healthier workforce increases the efficiency of companies and raises the productivity of the economy. The higher proportion of older people increases the burden on health care and social welfare. On the other hand, the lengthening of life may bring about important social and economic problems. For example, the quality of life may be problematic, because longer life does not necessarily mean a life without suffering and disability. On the other hand, pensions are no longer sustainable, as fewer workers are supporting more and more pensioners, and this may lead to an imbalance of incomes and a crisis in pension systems. So society must adopt and find new solutions to make life longer and healthier and more balanced, and to find the benefits and challenges of increased longevity. On the other hand, many people will have long periods of decline, during which they will need more and more help and they will be left without health and well-being, and thus raise ethical questions about care and dignity at the end of life.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent."; First of all, taking risks is the foundation of innovation. I strongly agree that it is possible to achieve the best when you put yourself out of the safe zone. The great inventor Steve Jobs, co-founder of the apple company, was famous for his risky ideas, such as the invention of the Iphone. Steve's experiments and risks reshaped the markets and changed the habits of consumers. For example, new activities develop skills that are useful in many areas. The ability to learn quickly and adapt to the environment is an invaluable skill in many different industries. It is therefore easy to see that success often lies in the willingness to explore the unknown. Finally, the unknown gives you the strength and a growth mind. People who only do what they already know are vulnerable to the progress of technology and the changes in society, while people who try new jobs and take risks in different areas are more resilient and capable of adapting to the environment. Through trial and error, they get valuable experience and a great sense of what they can achieve. In short, the relationship between taking risks and succeeding in life is indisputable. When you consider failure as an opportunity for learning, you will become more patient and persevering - a characteristic that many successful people have. Instead of relying on what you know well, it is more effective to take risks and try new things. People who want to achieve success should not be afraid of change, because they will be equipped with the tools they need to cope with the unpredictable future.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.; On the one hand, those who believe that all students, no matter what their academic record, should have the opportunity to receive a college or university education, claim that education is a basic human right and that it can help individuals to develop, provide equality and promote social mobility. These people argue that higher education is a human right and that education can help people to develop and improve their position in life. On the other hand, those who believe that higher education should be reserved for those who are academically outstanding argue that this will ensure that the students who enter the university are able to cope with the academic challenges of higher education. They also argue that the diversity of the student body can enrich the discussions in the university. Those who argue that higher education should be available to everyone put the emphasis on the quality of education and suggest that the university's integrity depends on maintaining high academic standards. Those who agree with this view emphasise the importance of maintaining high academic standards, arguing that this is necessary to ensure that the degree they give is of value. In my opinion, both arguments have their merits. However, I am more inclined to support the idea that higher education should be available to everyone. The main reason for this is that access to higher education will help to create a more inclusive society, where everyone can contribute to the collective development of humanity. Besides, not everyone shows their ability in the usual test or exam. Some people express their knowledge and skills in different ways. Although academic standards should be maintained, providing access to higher education will eventually benefit everyone.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent."; Making good university facilities, especially in the fields of practical knowledge, can substantially enhance the learning experience. Students in the newest laboratories can do practical work and get a deeper understanding of the subject. Students have better access to resources, so they are more likely to succeed in their work and prepare well for their future careers. The ability to access advanced equipment and software, modern learning spaces, and world-class laboratories can give students a better opportunity to be creative and invent new things. On the other hand, although famous teachers can enrich the reputation of a university and bring in new ideas, their influence is often related to the environment in which they are taught. Even the best teachers are unable to give the best quality teaching when there are no good equipment and equipment. The quality of the teaching environment has a rippling effect and brings prestige to the university, which in turn attracts more students and teachers. In short, although both faculty and facilities are important for the development of a university, improving the learning environment can have a more significant long-term effect. Even if a famous teacher is hired, he cannot perform well if he has old equipment and facilities.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.; I agree that high schools should allow students to choose their own subjects. First of all, students should be able to decide what subjects to learn. Empowering students to make their own decisions makes them take responsibility for their own learning, cultivates their interest, and makes them more enthusiastic about school subjects. It not only helps them to study better, but also prepares them for future decisions about careers and further education. For example, a student interested in art will be able to learn painting or graphic design in a free-choice system, instead of having to choose from subjects such as biology or chemistry, which are not really interested in. A student who is interested in technology can learn to program or learn to use robots, which can help him learn practical skills and develop his future career. In this way, students can develop their interests and delve deeper into the knowledge of the subjects they care about. In short, allowing high school students to choose their own subjects can provide a more personal, individual, and motivational learning environment for students. Secondly, students who choose their own subjects are more interested in learning, and their achievements are also higher. Students who choose their own subjects are more likely to be independent learners in the future.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;" The first thing I will say is that games are an important outlet for stress for adults. For adults, games can provide a great deal of relief and distraction from everyday life. In addition, there are many other benefits of playing games that go far beyond the enjoyment of entertainment, including mental well-being, social relationships and thinking skills. For example, studies have shown that playing a few hours of computer games can help reduce anxiety and lift people's moods, thereby contributing to mental regeneration. In the modern world, where adults have so many responsibilities and challenges, adults are under tremendous pressure. Therefore, when adults play games, whether it's computer games, board games, or sports, they can relax and release their minds. The second reason is that games are good for social relationships. In the digital age, many adults feel lonely because of their busy work, and they can get closer to each other through multi-player games. In addition, playing board games can help people communicate with each other and improve their relationships. Socialization is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. In addition, games can enhance our thinking skills, such as strategy games that require strategic thinking, problem-solving, and fast decision-making, which are all valuable skills for advancing careers and for life. Besides, they can develop people's ability to communicate and cooperate with others, which is a very important life skill. So, in conclusion, games are not only fun for children, but also have a significant effect on adults' psychological and thinking skills. The so-called ""games for adults"" are actually part of their healthy life, and it is necessary for adults to have a sense of games and play them."
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world."; I agree with the claim that technology is creating a single world culture. In my opinion, technology plays an important role in bringing people together to share ideas, customs, and lifestyles. First of all, the Internet is a powerful tool for cultural exchange, enabling people of different cultural backgrounds to share their ideas, customs, and lifestyles. For example, some music, such as K-pop, has become so popular that it has transcended the local and international borders. In this way, not only does it foster a single musical taste, but it also promotes the mixing of influences, creating new artistic expressions. On platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, people can view and share content from around the world. The connections between people from different cultural backgrounds create a collective voice, which in turn can challenge existing values and spark collective action. In this way, technology is reshaping cultural paradigms. Secondly, the social media plays an important role in the formation of the world’s narratives and values. For example, a campaign for climate change or for social justice often starts with a single hashtag that is shared by people around the world. In this way, a single world culture is a shared identity. However, it must also be noted that while technology may foster a single world culture, it does not eliminate the local culture. In this way, people are often encouraged to reflect on their own identity in a new way. Whereas the spread of a single world culture can sometimes threaten the plurality of cultures, it can also enhance the understanding of the different cultural backgrounds of people from around the world. In conclusion, modern technology undoubtedly facilitates the emergence of a single world culture by facilitating the sharing of experiences and the blending of cultural influences.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.; In the first place, modern communication technology has changed the way families communicate. The first reason why family support has played an important role in individual success has been a change in the nature and scale of support over time. In the past, geographical distance often limited the family's ability to support each other. Today, with the advent of instant messages, the possibility of seeing each other through video calls and the possibility of chatting on social networks, family members can support each other, regardless of their location, and provide advice and encouragement when the individual has encountered a difficult personal or professional situation. The next reason is that the modern family is more flexible and more supportive. Secondly, the modern family structure has changed. The modern family is much more democratic than in the past and the members are much more inclined to work together and help each other. Many families emphasize the importance of learning and personal development, encourage children to pursue their passions and goals, and try to provide support in all areas. The concept of success is changing as well, because families realize that success is not just a financial achievement, but is also personal growth and happiness. As a result, the family can offer a much broader set of support and encourage its members to achieve various goals, thus increasing the chances of its members. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the majority of families cannot support each other, because there are still many social and economic differences between families that prevent them from providing support to their members. And finally, to conclude, the modern family is more supportive, more comprehensive and closer than in the past.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners."; It is easy to see that literature is more enjoyable than film for me. Although the two types of storytelling are different, the depth and quality of literature far surpasses that of film. For example, in the novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, the reader can deeply understand Elizabeth Bennet’s changing feelings for Mr. Darcy, which is often lost in film versions. In literature, the reader is deeply involved in the character’s thoughts, feelings and motivations. In film, however, the visual element of the story takes priority over psychological depth. In literature, the reader is forced to imagine the setting, construct their own images of the characters, and construct their own interpretations of the story. This process encourages the reader to think about the story and helps to develop his own personality. In addition, the pace of the book is chosen by the reader, whether he stops at a particular passage or runs through a thrilling scene, the reader has the freedom to make his own choices. But in the film, the visual setting and the actors’ costumes are defined by the director’s vision, which makes it difficult for the reader to use his imagination. As a result, reading novels and short stories not only enhances our ability to tell stories, but also enhances our ability to empathize and think critically. In conclusion, although literature and film both have their merits, literature provides a more enriching and enjoyable experience for the reader.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page."; As our world grows smaller, having one common language will facilitate business and social relationships. Those who argue in favour of language extinction say that in a world where we are increasingly interdependent, a common language would facilitate international relations, business and cooperation between various groups. Opponents of this view emphasize the immense loss of cultural diversity that will result from language extinction. They say that if people have a common language, there will be less misunderstanding and a sense of unity will be enriched. They claim that language variety adds to humanity’s common experience, offering different ways of interpreting and relating to the world. When a language dies, a whole wealth of knowledge and experience disappears with it. Many indigenous languages, for example, have preserved knowledge of the environment, medicine and social practices that are not available elsewhere. We should strive to preserve endangered languages and to encourage multilingualism rather than allowing their extinction. I believe that the efficiency of communication offered by a common language is more attractive than the loss of linguistic diversity, which carries with it the threat of the richness of culture and experience. In conclusion, it is vital to preserve languages and to support multilingualism if we are to preserve cultural diversity and to promote the creation of a truly international society. If we preserve linguistic variety, we will understand and appreciate different cultures better and thereby contribute to a deeper understanding and more lasting harmony that goes beyond mere communication.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.; So, the slowness of life in the old days, that is, in the past, is one of the reasons why older people may feel that it is better. Although there are a lot of logical reasons for arguing that the life of the old people was easier and better than the modern, it is too romantic, and does not take into account the significant improvements and challenges that have occurred. Some older people recall neighborhood meetings and leisurely life. This is a sharp contrast to today's digital era, which is constantly disturbed by new data, noise and changes. Because of the lack of medical progress, the death rate was higher, and there was little access to medical care, and diseases such as polio and tuberculosis could be devastating. However, this reflects a past that was more difficult, for example: The old people were the first to experience the industrial revolution and a lot of difficult labor. Although the memories of a simpler past can evoke positive memories, it is important to consider the advances we have made. The most important is that a lot of people, especially the marginalized, have suffered from the difference in social expectations and practices. This gives us a balanced view of the complexities of both eras, while acknowledging the development of human society. Rather than thinking of the past as unequivocally better, it is more useful to appreciate both the advantages of modern life and the lessons we can learn from the past.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.; In the first place, money management is an important life skill that enables people to make informed decisions about their finances. In this fast-paced world where the financial situation is getting more and more complex, I firmly agree that the teaching of practical money skills to young people is important for their future success and well-being. Teaching how to manage one’s finances in schools can help to prevent mistakes that can have long-term consequences, such as bad debt and poor credit ratings. When young people start to make their own money, they have to cope with a range of responsibilities such as budgeting, saving and investing. They must understand how interest rates, inflation and the value of savings work. By including financial education in the school curriculum, it can help to prevent the situation when young people are unprepared to make these decisions for themselves. In the third place, teaching money management in schools also has positive social consequences. Young people from different socio-economic backgrounds often have very different access to financial knowledge. Moreover, by developing good financial habits while still young, it makes it more likely that they will continue into adulthood. That is why it is important that secondary schools and higher education institutions should include the teaching of money management in their curriculum. It not only gives young people the skills they need for life but also makes society fairer. Schools can teach everyone the same curriculum and ensure that all students have the tools to be financially successful and to achieve their own well-being.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.; For me, I would prefer to live alone. The reasons are my wish for independence, space, and the freedom to create the living environment I want. This allows me to live my life according to my own priorities and preferences. I value my autonomy in the timetable, my social life and the daily chores without having to compromise. For example, I can invite my friends to my home and let my hobbies go late without worrying about disturbing anyone. As a single person, I have full control of the room and its furnishings, and I can create a living space that reflects my individuality and values, which is extremely gratifying. Besides, personal space is very important to me. I would like to live in peace and quiet and I would like to study or relax undisturbed, without any outside interference. In addition, I live alone because it encourages me to take responsibility for my life and myself. As a single person, I live my life completely in my own way, so to speak. I agree that living with a roommate can create social contacts and lower the cost of rent, but I would rather be independent, to control my environment and to develop as a person. Living with someone can be fun, but it can also be valuable to live alone and use the time for self-reflection and personal development.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.; I strongly agree that smoking in restaurants should not be allowed and support state laws that ban it. This view is based on public health, the environment and the fundamental rights of individuals. The issue of smoking in public places, especially in restaurants, has become increasingly relevant in recent decades. Smoking affects not only the health of smokers but also the health of those around them. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducts the 4 report, the air we breathe when we smoke consists of more than 7,000 toxic and harmful substances. According to the 5 report, this can cause serious health problems, including cancer and lung diseases. 6 Many restaurant guests would prefer to enjoy a pleasant and clean meal in a smoke-free environment. Smoking laws in restaurants protect both visitors and employees from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke. Finally, promoting smoke-free laws goes hand in hand with the growing social movement for healthier lifestyles. In the long run, restaurants that have smoke-free rooms can increase their income and, at the same time, support the health of their visitors. 7 In conclusion, I firmly believe that smoking in restaurants should not be allowed and that state laws protecting public health should be upheld. As society becomes more aware of the health risks of smoking, it is important that legislation be compatible with this new reality. Enforcing state laws against smoking in restaurants is an important step towards a healthier lifestyle. Public health and clean and pleasant dining environments should be prioritised.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.; To what extent do you agree or disagree? I completely agree that violence in films has a negative effect on younger audiences, especially when it leads to the desensitization, aggressive behavior and distortion of reality. Moreover, many films tend to glamorize violence, portraying it in a seductive and fascinating manner. Research has shown that desensitization may lead to a reduced ability to empathize with the victims of violence, as well as a decrease in the ability to feel compassion for the victims. There are many studies that have shown that violence in films is associated with increased aggressive behavior in children. In fact, young people may think that it is the best way to deal with conflicts and establish their dominance. Meanwhile, the violent content of films distorts young people's views of social justice. Since the violent content of the film is often shown without the usual consequences that usually follow such acts in reality, it is easy to think that such actions can be carried out without consequences. The dangers of desensitization, normalization of aggressive behavior and distortion of reality require us to critically examine the content of the media and, as media managers, to promote responsible media consumption that emphasizes the psychological and emotional well-being of young people. In conclusion, the increasing violence in films has undoubtedly had a negative effect on youngsters.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence."; To begin with, the news outlets have their own editorial policies, biases, and approaches. In the end, if you depend on a single source, you may have a distorted view of the news and issues. I agree with the idea that it is necessary to have a variety of news sources to be informed. The different news media, with their different slants, can provide the reader with a more complex understanding of the news and issues. For example, the fact that one publication is conservative can cause the fact that the publication is conservative to present facts in a way that is in harmony with its ideology, while the liberal source can have a completely different approach to the news. Also, people who rely on one source are likely to miss important views and facts. This is necessary to form a balanced opinion and make decisions. In addition, in this age of fake news, when a single news site can spread a fake story very quickly, a variety of sources serves as a guarantee of not being deceived. Finally, in a time when fake news is so easily spread by social networks, a variety of sources serves as a guarantee that the information presented is reliable. The reader develops the ability to think critically, and this is a great contribution to the formation of a civil society. In conclusion, it is necessary to get information from different news sources in order to be informed.
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.; Those who argue in favor of new construction in the cities argue that land is a valuable and scarce resource in the city. It is therefore desirable to use the land as much as possible to build new houses and business buildings, especially in densely populated areas. The advocates of the preservation of old buildings on the other hand emphasize the importance of historical context. They believe that demolition or the conversion of old buildings to new ones optimizes the use of land and provides economic opportunities for businesses and residents in accordance with current demands. But old buildings also have unique constructions and materials that cannot be found in modern buildings, and these are an important aesthetic and cultural asset for urban areas. Historical buildings are also a link to the past for future generations. In my opinion, the city should consider the old building as an asset and not just a burden to the development. Rather than converting it to a new purpose, it should be retained in its original character. In this way, a harmonious development of the city is possible where there is respect for the past and modernization.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.; On the one hand, mobile phones have access to unprecedented information and facilitate the interconnection of communication between people. Although many people believe that this dependency is bad, I believe that the popularity of mobile phones among young people serves both a positive and a negative purpose, which reflects the complexity of modern life and communication. My own experience confirms this advantage. For example, young people can easily access news and news platforms and learn about world events. Through a variety of educational resources, they can also learn outside of the classroom. I have also noticed that when my friends use their mobile phones too much during the gathering, they often have less conversation, which sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, the excessive use of mobile phones can have a bad influence on the psychological well-being of young people. Because the face-to-face interaction of young people is neglected and the development of social skills is blocked, they feel lonely. They are also easily influenced by the attention of the phone and the number of messages, which is a bad influence on their mental health and school performance. Therefore, although the popularity of mobile phones has brought unprecedented convenience and access to information for young people, they have also brought great challenges. We should learn to use mobile phones reasonably and benefit from them to the fullest extent.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution."; On the one hand, those who argue for fixed punishments, state that the legal system is fair and impartial, and that clear messages can be sent about the consequences of certain actions. On the other hand, those who are in favour of individual sentencing, argue that it is fair to punish an offender according to the circumstances of the crime. The question of whether punishment should be fixed for each crime or whether it should depend on the individual circumstances of each case is a complicated one. The circumstances of a crime, and the motive for committing it, can vary considerably. For example, a theft committed out of sheer desperation is seen by some as being morally different from one committed out of greed. On the other hand, the counter-argument argues that a case-by-case approach is a more nuanced approach and is less open to abuse. Further, they argue that, under a system of fixed punishments, there is a danger of disproportionate sentences being imposed, with no regard for an offender’s background, mental health or remorse. By assessing the individual circumstances, judges can make more informed decisions, which are more likely to be based on justice and rehabilitation, rather than simply retribution. In conclusion, the legal system is fairer and more effective when individual circumstances are taken into account. A young person who has been neglected in his or her upbringing may respond to a different punishment from a hardened criminal. In the end, a system that takes into account both the need for consistent punishments and individual circumstances will serve justice more effectively.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.; Firstly, spending free time outdoors makes me enjoy the pleasure of nature, which is refreshing and invigorating. The attraction of nature and the mental and physical benefits of outdoor activities make spending free time outdoors more satisfying for me. For example, I was so amazed by the stunning views and the tranquility of the environment during my hiking trip that I felt very comfortable and connected with nature. Whether I go hiking in the mountains, ride a bike through the park, or walk on the beach, I feel like nature is so beautiful and so fresh. I enjoy jogging in the morning when the street is empty and the air is cool, which not only helps me to build my stamina, but also makes me feel more energetic during the day. Secondly, outdoor activities can help me maintain good health and fitness. For example, if I play football, run, or swim, I will naturally be more energetic. Thirdly, outdoor activities often bring people together, such as sports and family parties. Then the endorphins in the exercise and the refreshing outdoor environment can make people think clearly and relieve mental stress. Outside activities can be balanced and effective, so they are very important to my free time. In conclusion, my preference for outdoor activities stems from my love of nature, the physical benefits it offers, and the social benefits that often come with it. In contrast, indoor activities, such as watching TV or reading books, are usually solitary and isolated.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.; Cheaper flights have completely changed the world of travel by making it more available to people who previously could not afford to fly. Advocates of cheaper air travel often emphasize the extent to which it democratizes mobility, making it possible for everyone to travel to distant places. Cheap flights thus encourage cultural exchanges, but they also cause damage to the environment, since air travel contributes to global warming. The criticism that cheap flights lead to more pollution and depletion of natural resources is a common response to this new freedom of movement. Others believe that by raising the cost of air travel, we can discourage unnecessary flights and encourage sustainable travel behavior such as taking the train or traveling to more local destinations that require less CO2-emitting transport. In my opinion, a balanced approach is needed. A better understanding of the environment's impact on air travel can help us become more considerate when traveling. At the same time, cheap flights can be combined with the development of alternatives, such as high-speed trains, to offset the impact on the environment. The development of offsets and sustainable aviation technology can also reduce the CO2 footprint of air travel without restricting the availability of it. Cheap flights thus make personal freedom and economic opportunities more available, but we must not neglect the harmful effects they have on the environment. For future generations, therefore, it is important to strive for a balance between exploration and the environment.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;" The advantages of living in a small town are many, but I would prefer the quiet and tranquility of a small town. While both places have advantages, I prefer the charm and tranquility of a small town. In my home town, for example, local festivals such as the local market and the New Year's Day celebrations provide a sense of belonging to the local community and an opportunity to celebrate the local culture and history. In a small town, relationships tend to be more personal and meaningful; neighbors are more likely to know each other, get along with each other and help each other when necessary. Furthermore, the life in a small town is usually less hectic and more relaxing. The streets are less crowded, and the daily hustle and bustle are replaced by more greenery and open spaces. Compared to the hustle and bustle of the city, this sense of security and mutual support is easier to find in the bustling atmosphere of a small town. Finally, small towns tend to be less expensive than large cities. As a child, I loved to play in the parks around my house and ride my bike or just relax in the natural surroundings. In the city, however, this opportunity to experience nature and to be in contact with nature is rare and can easily be overwhelmed by the constant noise of the city. In short, although large cities have some advantages, the amenities and opportunities available in a small town are far more appealing to me. Small-town residents often have a better quality of life than in a large city, and they can dedicate more time to their hobbies and personal interests than to chasing expensive housing and living costs. I think it is the perfect place to escape the chaos and crowdedness of urban life."
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.; One of the most powerful non-monetary rewards is recognition. In addition to salary increases and promotions, there are many other incentives that can be very effective in encouraging continued good work, such as job satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately a productive working environment. There are many companies that have the “Employee of the Month” program or have a quarterly meeting where they can share their employees’ contributions. This not only gives the employees that are recognized a feeling of well-being, but also inspires others to work harder. A public acknowledgment of an employee’s achievements can boost morale and motivation. Often, high-tech companies like Google, for example, have more flexible working hours, which also shows their trust in employees’ ability to manage their time. Offering employees the opportunity to work remotely or allowing them to adjust their working hours can help them to improve their work-life balance. It can also show their commitment to the advancement of their careers. A professional development opportunity is another effective reward. This freedom can lead to increased productivity and establish a culture of responsibility. As an example, Deloitte has a mentor program that not only helps employees to improve their skills but also to build a supportive community. The possibility of attending courses or completing a course will strengthen employees and make them feel valued and loyal. In conclusion, in addition to monetary rewards, recognition, flexibility, and professional development are effective ways to encourage and reward good work. Organizing retreats, workshops, and health days creates team cohesion and shows concern for employee health. Many companies, like Zappos, are well known for focusing on their employees’ well-being and creating a culture of belonging. This can build a team of motivated employees who are committed to excellence.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.; I believe that going to classes is necessary for a number of reasons. First of all, the opportunity to engage with the teacher and classmates directly in the classroom is a direct engagement. Missing the class means losing out on valuable opportunities for discussion and clarification, which could seriously affect the academic performance of those who miss them. The learning environment is thus established and enriched by a number of interactions, such as asking the teacher and the class about the content of the lesson and participating in class discussions that help deepen the understanding of the subject matter. Not only does the discussion improve learning, but it also helps students develop critical thinking and communication skills that are important for later work. Students are also taught the responsibility of educating themselves when they go to university, but the transition to independence is often difficult, so it is important to teach them the importance of discipline and responsibility for their own education. Finally, the required attendance creates a sense of responsibility in students. However, the opposite effect of not having classes is that it encourages students to delay their studies and avoid them. Besides, there is a social aspect of attending classes that must not be underestimated. This structure gives the student the opportunity to learn how to manage their time and create a routine that is important for the success of their future studies and work. Meeting and getting to know peers during classes and activities often leads to group work, study groups and lifelong friendships. Going to classes is therefore a part of the university experience and these socializations are vital to the student's personal and professional growth. Finally, the learning environment and the social life that the university creates through compulsory attendance create a very positive impact on the student's life in the long run. In conclusion, although some may claim that they can benefit from the freedom of choosing whether to go to class or not, the advantages of compulsory attendance, such as learning, responsibility and socialization, are substantial.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.; Personally, I would prefer to live in a small town. Small towns are distinguished by a strong sense of community. I would like to live in a small town. There are lots of local festivals, local bazaars, and local festivals that bring the community together in a way that is difficult to establish in the anonymity of a large city. In small towns, people know each other, and they form strong ties and support each other. Furthermore, small towns are usually much quieter and peaceful than big cities. The noise and traffic of big cities can be very depressing. The local community can often help in times of crisis. Besides, the cost of living is much lower in small towns. Finally, the environment is usually more beautiful in small towns. There are more opportunities for hiking, cycling, and enjoying nature. The well-being of both body and mind is much higher. Finally, although big cities offer more opportunities and are more varied, the benefits of living in a small town, such as the sense of community, the peace and quiet, and the low cost of living, are more enjoyable and more fulfilling. For example, the cost of housing is usually much lower than in big cities. As a result, there is a better balance between working and enjoying life. I think the choice between small town and big city has a big influence on our overall happiness.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.; On the one hand, it is true that the use of computers has facilitated a number of activities. But on the other hand, I believe that many additional burdens have been added to human life. For example, the Internet has brought immediate information. The internet has reduced the time needed for such mundane chores as filling out forms, entering numbers, and getting replies to messages. A revolution has also taken place in the way we communicate with people around the world. In a few clicks we can reach people in any part of the world and establish relationships and work together on projects that formerly were geographically limited. Students can do research quickly and so can learn more effectively. It has also brought a paradox, however: as the need for connection and social media grows, the feeling of isolation and anxiety from the pressure to maintain an online presence can lead to the opposite. But the complexity of the plethora of programs and applications and the continual updates and changes can cause anxiety. Meanwhile, our minds are often occupied by the need to reply to the ever-increasing demands for our attention. And in the end, in order to understand the relationship between human beings and technology, we must look at both the advantages and the disadvantages. One way to live a full and rewarding life is to take advantage of the tools that are available to us in a way that enhances and simplifies life, and it is up to each individual to decide how best to do that.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.; o the promotion of home work? There are many arguments for and against the encouragement of home work, and it has been argued on both sides. One of the main advantages of working at home is the improvement of work-life balance. And it's because employees can better meet their personal needs. Working from home also increases productivity, as employees can work in an environment that suits them. In addition, employees do not need to travel every day, which means that they can better work and have more job satisfaction. Also, companies can reduce operating costs and use the savings on employee benefits, technology, or training. A lower cost structure can enhance a company's competitiveness in the market and encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. Moreover, not everyone has a productive home environment that makes them work effectively. Moreover, the feeling of isolation can reduce the ability to work together and the company's ability to work together. However, there are also compelling arguments against the encouragement of home work. The work environment can be more enjoyable and enriched, while the modern working environment evolves and changes. In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to encouraging home work, I believe that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.; The issue of the role of a university professor has long been a source of debate. The debate has focused on whether research or education should be the professor's priority. The main role of a professor is to educate the next generation of leaders, professionals and thinkers. Professors are not just dispensers of knowledge, but help create future leaders, professionals and thinkers. Effective teaching cultivates critical thinking, creativity and intellectual curiosity that are essential in a rapidly changing world. The learning process also benefits from a professor's research activities. When professors are engaged in cutting-edge research, they bring fresh insights and practical experience to the classroom. By putting the education role as the main task, professors can encourage students to learn deeply about their subjects and help them acquire the necessary skills for their future careers. Moreover, the effect of education goes beyond the classroom. If professors devote too much time to research, they will miss the chance to mentor students individually, and the classroom will be less interactive and students and professors will be able to exchange ideas freely. In summary, while research is undeniably important for advancing knowledge and increasing the prestige of the university, the main role of a professor is to educate students. The knowledge and skills acquired in universities have far-reaching consequences, and the role of professors as educators is paramount. So a balance must be found between research and education.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.; I agree that the benefits of technology are very important, but I also agree that the negative impact of technology must be considered seriously. During the past century, technology has undeniably transformed every aspect of human life and has made great contributions to the economy, the environment, and the well-being of society. However, this rapid development has also resulted in a number of unwelcome consequences that cannot be ignored. On the one hand, technology has greatly improved communication, health and education. For example, the Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate and access information, breaking down geographical barriers. The development of telemedicine and artificial intelligence in medicine has improved people's health and increased their life expectancy. Nevertheless, the negative consequences of technology have also been substantial. One of the most serious is the invasion of privacy that digital surveillance brings. On the other hand, e-learning has given remote and isolated areas access to knowledge and skills. In addition, as automation has taken over human labor in many industries, the unemployment rate and income gap between rich and poor have become more pronounced. Moreover, the expansion of social media and the collection of personal data has made us less independent and more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Meanwhile, as technology becomes more and more dependent on fossil fuels for energy, the crisis of climate change has also become more severe. It is also worth noting that the impact of technology on the environment cannot be ignored. How to balance the positive and negative aspects of technology is the key to a sustainable and equitable future.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.; I agree to a certain extent, since I believe that by placing prevention first, the individual as well as the health system as a whole may benefit in the long run. The idea that prevention should be the first priority of a country's health budget is a common one among health professionals and policy makers. And rightly so, because there is ample evidence that a major reduction in chronic diseases can be achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, good nutrition and physical activity. There are also several benefits for the health system itself. In the first place, prevention reduces the burden on the health system and the cost of care, as well as improving the health and well-being of citizens. For example, the cost of complications from chronic diseases, with hospitalization and long-term therapy, can be very high. Furthermore, preventing serious diseases may reduce the cost of the health system in the long run. However, it is also important to emphasize that prevention is a crucial part of health care, but not at the expense of sufficient treatment. By implementing health measures such as screening and vaccination campaigns, for example, considerable savings can be made and resources used more effectively. I believe that a large part of the country's health budget should go towards health education and preventive measures, not only to support the individual, but also to maintain the health system and ultimately contribute to a healthier population and lower cost of the health system. For example, people who have already had health problems need care and follow-up to manage their illness.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.; Students who live in university dormitories can easily adapt to university life. Both living situations have their advantages and disadvantages, and they both have advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of dormitories is the proximity of university libraries, classrooms, and sports halls, which is convenient for students to attend classes and attend various activities. Moreover, the residents of the dormitories are close to each other, and it is easy for them to meet friends and attend various social events. The advantage of living in an apartment in the city is that it gives the students a lot of freedom and independence. Besides, the student's relationship with the outside world is easy, which can prevent loneliness, especially in the first year of university life. Living in the city also gives students a wider social experience. They can meet local people and have a different social experience, which can make students have a more varied social experience. I personally would like to live in an apartment in the city. I would like to learn the skills of cooking and cooking myself, learn how to spend less money and do more things, and become an adult. Although I appreciate the convenience and social opportunities of university dormitories, I would also like to enjoy the freedom and independence of apartment life.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;" I believe that zoos are very important for the education of the public about animals and the environment. Whether zoos are useful for the general public is a matter of dispute, and opinions are divided on this issue. The educational aspect of zoos has been recognized for a long time and is a source of great pride to the public. Zoos are an excellent way to help children learn about the environment, including the significance of conservation, through educational programmes and guided tours. Zoos give visitors the opportunity to observe animals in a way that is not possible in their natural habitats, which can lead to a greater understanding of animal behaviour. Many zoos participate in breeding programmes to increase the number of threatened species, and the success of such programmes is shown by the reintroduction of species like the Californian condor and Arabian oryx after extensive efforts in captivity. Zoos also contribute to the conservation of endangered species. Critics argue that keeping animals in captivity is inhumane. However, many zoos now focus on animal welfare and try to create conditions that replicate natural environments and allow animals to show natural behaviour. Without zoos, animals would face extinction from poaching and the destruction of their natural environment. Zoos are not without purpose; they are vital educational and conservation institutions. Lastly, modern zoos are also committed to research, which provides zoos with important information about animal care and conservation. By encouraging an appreciation of nature and by protecting endangered species, zoos contribute to society and the natural world."
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives."; My personal preference is for the serious movies that are designed to provoke thought and reflection. Although there is certainly a place for entertainment movies, I prefer the depth and complexity of serious movies. For example, movies such as Schindler’s List or 12 Years a Slave, not only show the horrors of history, but they also offer insights into human nature, compassion, and the consequences of inaction. Another reason I prefer serious movies is that they are often based on a complex theme that requires the audience to think. Also, they usually have an intricate plot and characters. If a film invests in developing its characters, it connects with the audience emotionally and helps it feel empathy for them. Serious films also encourage the audience to talk and debate about their content, so that they understand it more deeply. For example, The Pursuit of Happyness is a film about the struggles of a father who wants to give his son a better life and ends up inspiring people to reflect on their own lives and goals. In conclusion, comedies have their charm and provide a moment of lightheartedness and fun, but I prefer the depth and complexity of serious films. For example, movies such as The Social Network can spark discussions about ambition, ethics, and the complexities of relationships in the digital age. These discussions contribute to a better understanding of contemporary society, as well as help people reflect on their own views and values. Serious films offer a cinematic experience that is more rewarding and sticks with you long after you’ve seen them.
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.; I strongly agree that the focus of the media on the private lives of these people takes them away from important issues. I have a strong opinion about the undue emphasis on the personal lives of public figures and celebrities, especially because in today's digital age, the media plays an undeniably important role in influencing public opinion. This disproportionate emphasis on the private lives of celebrities not only trivializes important social issues, but also encourages superficiality and favors entertainment over awareness and education. Whilst details about a celebrity's personal life, such as the scandal of a relationship or the choice of clothes, dominate the headlines, global issues such as climate change, political corruption and social justice are often only marginally covered. It is worth mentioning that the media's incessant observation often leads to an invasion of privacy, and that celebrities often become the subject of unfair criticism and judgement. In addition, the focus on the private lives of public figures can also lead to dangerous narratives. In particular, the younger generation is prone to identifying success with popularity rather than hard work and a significant contribution to society. Finally, the emphasis on the personal lives of celebrities blurs the values of society, encouraging people to idolize fame rather than integrity and achievements. This can lead to dehumanization, further stereotypes and judgment instead of understanding. In my opinion, a more balanced and more responsible media environment is needed, which provides useful information instead of sensationalism. In summary, although the attention given to public figures by the media can be an entertaining distraction, I believe that an excessive focus on the private lives of celebrities can have a detrimental effect on both the individual and society.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.; For many people, visiting museums is a necessary part of traveling. Visiting museums is not only a collection of art and history, but also a tool for exploring new cultures, allowing people to understand the world better. Visit the British Museum in London and see the Rosetta Stone and other ancient Egyptian artifacts, you will feel the progress of ancient Egypt. The history of civilization is a common and unique exhibition of artifacts, collections and exhibitions, and they are able to form a close relationship with the past, so that people can better understand the past, and thereby have a deeper understanding of the present. The Louvre in Paris has masterpieces that can be seen and touched by art lovers, and children can learn about science and natural history from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., which is in line with the interests and ages of children. The opportunity to learn and inspire is another important reason why people like to visit museums. For example, some museums will present exhibitions on climate change or social justice, and visitors will have discussions on how to face the issue of justice and advocacy. All these can inspire people to learn, and even stimulate their creativity. Visiting a museum can enrich one's travel experience, and leave a long-lasting memory of sightseeing. In summary, people travel to museums for a variety of reasons, such as the desire to learn and inspire themselves, and the desire to discuss important social issues.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school."; In this essay, I want to discuss the benefits of studying at home by using technology. I believe that the advantages of home-based learning outweigh those of schools in the fast-changing field of education. The first advantage is flexibility. Students can manage their own schedule and learning time according to their own interests. A person who is very interested in sports can practice more and study less, which will motivate him and make him happier. The second advantage is the richness of learning resources. For example, digital learning platforms can offer students more opportunities to experience learning through simulations and playback. The third advantage is the reduction of school-based stress. Many students have to face the problem of bullying or peer pressure in schools, which may affect their learning. By using a variety of learning resources, students can find the most effective way to learn complex concepts, which can ultimately improve learning outcomes. This will make home-based learning an increasingly viable and attractive choice for future students. In summary, although schools provide a sense of security and social interaction, I would prefer the flexibility and richness of home-based learning.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;" First, the shopping center would probably change the special characteristics of the neighborhood. Although some might argue that a shopping center could improve convenience and employment opportunities, the negative impact on the community’s dynamics, traffic congestion and the environment would be far greater. In short, the new shopping center would replace the community’s distinct identity with commercial conformity. The distinctive character of our neighborhood is reflected in the local businesses that cater to its unique identity. A large retail complex could hurt these businesses, whose success depends on customer loyalty and their ties to the neighborhood. In addition, an increase in traffic would probably lead to more accidents and would be inconvenient for families and residents who enjoy the tranquility of the neighborhood. Finally, the resulting increase in traffic congestion would be considerable. Our streets are already quite busy during rush hour; a new shopping center would probably make them even more so, thereby making them more dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. Also, since a shopping center requires a significant change in land use, it would probably disrupt the natural habitat of local species. Moreover, the demolition of existing buildings to make way for a new complex would lead to an increase in air and water pollution and the elimination of a significant portion of the area’s green space, a loss that would be detrimental to the health of the local environment and the community’s recreational opportunities. The preservation of the neighborhood’s distinctive character and its sense of well-being should take precedence over commercial interests. In conclusion, despite the lure of convenience and employment opportunities, the disadvantages of building a shopping center in my neighborhood—in particular, the possible damage to the local environment, the loss of the neighborhood’s unique character and the resulting increase in traffic congestion—far outweigh any possible benefits."
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress."; This skill is very important because in today's world we are unable to live in isolation and technology is making us more and more closely connected. Therefore, the ability to communicate clearly, listen actively, and make close relationships with others is becoming more and more important in both personal and professional lives. For example, a team of people working on a new product is a good example of a group of people that needs to work together. Effective communication is essential to success. First, it creates a sense of trust and encourages open communication. This allows the exchange of diverse perspectives and ultimately better decisions and outcomes. Second, communication skills are needed to overcome cultural differences. People who can express their opinions and participate in discussions are more likely to offer up new ideas. For example, a manager who listens to his team members and changes his communication style to fit them is more likely to create a cohesive team, which will result in fewer conflicts and higher productivity. Third, as companies become more international, employees often have to work with people from different cultures. If we can understand and respect their communication styles, it will help us avoid misunderstandings and maintain harmony. Fourth, the ability to communicate effectively is necessary to create a positive self-image and be successful in the world of social media. By presenting oneself in a good light, we can increase our visibility to potential partners and recruiters. For this reason, in a complex world, the ability to communicate effectively will help to distinguish individuals and achieve success. To sum up, learning to communicate effectively is an important skill for success in today's world.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds."; In general, groups are important in the lives of people because they are the source of their social relationships. They are the source of their social relationships. They are the source of their support. They are the source of their support. A study group, for example, not only helps to understand difficult subjects but also creates a strong friendship. A book club, a sports club, a professional group, etc., all create strong friendships and common interests between members. Also, in the collective activities of a charity, members of the organization work together to solve social issues such as poverty or education. In the social relationships between the members of the group, people share their experience, cultural background and their opinions, which enriches their understanding of the world and promotes their personal development. Furthermore, a well-organized group increases its productivity, because the precise division of labor makes it possible to focus on common goals. This gives a higher meaning to the efforts of the members of the group. Finally, groups and organizations are a source of support. During difficult times and transitions in life, people turn to them for guidance and support. They are the source of emotional and psychological support. This support goes beyond affiliation, it shapes personal identity and enhances personal well-being. Because of this importance, people are motivated to seek out and get involved in different groups and organizations, which contributes to a more active and fulfilling life.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.; One of the major advantages of establishing a university in our country is that it will lead to the development of the local economy. Universities are important economic engines and provide employment not only for academic staff but also for support personnel and local businesses that rely on the influx of students and faculty. However, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered when establishing a university in the country. Another advantage is that local residents can benefit from higher education. The university can also attract research grants and establish relationships with industries, thereby encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. The university can also help to boost the retail, housing and restaurant industries, thus improving the city's vitality and vitality. In addition, the university can promote the cultural and intellectual development of the local community by providing venues for lectures, workshops and other activities. The university will also create opportunities for higher education, thereby reducing the need for students to leave the area to seek a good education. And will also develop the local people's skills, thereby improving the competition in the labor market. However, universities will also bring some disadvantages. The construction and operation of the university will bring traffic congestion and noise, which will disturb the peace of residents. The overload of the local transport system will also increase the burden on the budget. However, the influx of students will increase the rent of housing, thereby increasing the cost of living, and affecting the long-term development of the city. In short, although establishing a university in the country has many advantages, such as economic development and education opportunities, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered when establishing a university.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government."; These arguments have been raised on both sides. In favor of free college education advocates say that a higher education should be a right of every citizen like elementary and secondary education. Opponents of free college education argue that individuals should be responsible for their own education. A well-educated populace can better contribute to the economy, invent and make the population more mobile. Moreover, in Germany and Sweden, where college education is free, the attendance is very high and the student debt is low, and this model can be a successful model for other countries. However, the costs of college education will fall on taxpayers, which can cause future inefficiencies. For example, competition for admission will decrease, which may lead to a glut of college graduates on the labor market and thus a decrease in the value of college degrees. The idea of free college education is in accordance with the principle of equality, but it is difficult to solve the problems of the cost and the value of the degree. Therefore, the solution is to establish a balanced system between government subsidies and individual responsibilities. Higher education should be within the reach of everyone, but individuals must be responsible for the costs.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television."; I disagree with the assertion that communication is destroyed by the media. In fact, I believe that if it is used correctly, it can be the starting point for conversation and communication between friends and family. For example, when a person and a friend watch a popular program together, they can talk about the characters, the way the plot develops, and the implications of the program, and this often leads to lively and frank conversations that might not have happened without it. First of all, television provides many shared experiences that can strengthen relationships between individuals. For example, watching a popular program every week, a family often finds new topics to discuss, thus strengthening their ties to each other. Moreover, the media can be an educational tool that can lead to a conversation on important issues. This is the case when the news or a documentary brings important issues into the living room and gives the family a platform for the exchange of opinions and the education of each other. However, the use of the media can destroy communication if it is not controlled. In my opinion, although excessive use of the media can destroy communication, when used correctly it can be a useful tool for establishing communication. For this reason, it is important for families and friends to make rules and regulate the use of the media so that it remains a tool for enrichment rather than distraction. If used correctly, the media can be an important tool in the establishment of communication.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life."; I agree with this statement. The first reason is that the live performance gives the spectator a unique experience which cannot be duplicated on a screen. The audience energy and its impact on the performance is very strong. Its exhilaration and excitement, as well as the spontaneity of the performance, create an atmosphere which makes the spectator feel more intimate. In addition, watching on a screen is often cold and devoid of the same kind of emotional connection as watching the performance in person. When one attends a concert, for example, one feels the music vibrating in one's body, one sees the artist on stage and, therefore, one does not feel as one does when one sees it from home. For another thing, when you attend a live event, you can share the experience with other spectators. When you support your favorite sports team or when you join a singing crowd at a concert, you feel a sense of community and belonging to something. These instances contribute to the unforeseen and give the spectator a very unique and unforgettable experience. On the other hand, it is often a solitary and much less fulfilling experience to watch something at home alone. I conclude that the enjoyment of live performances is enhanced by the atmosphere of participation, the involvement of others and the unforeseen that they create, which create unforgettable memories that linger in the memory long after the event is over. In contrast, televised events are often too polished and predictable, which makes them less spontaneous than live events.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon."; I firmly agree that the use of alternative resources (solar, wind, water) will replace fossil fuels (gas, oil, coal). This transition is not only necessary, but also inevitable, because of the impact on the environment, economics and technology. This transition from fossil to alternative energy sources is a matter of great concern and urgency for contemporary society. The main reason for this transition is the necessity to fight climate change. The use of fossil fuels contributes to the production of greenhouse gases that cause warming and catastrophic weather events. On the other hand, alternative energy sources are clean and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. Moreover, the economic benefit of alternative energy is becoming increasingly evident. For example, the price of solar panels and wind generators has fallen sharply over the last ten years. The lower the cost, the more attractive the technology becomes, which will also have an impact on job creation. This trend is likely to continue as economies of scale increase. The transition to alternative energy also reduces the dependence of countries on the volatile and unreliable fossil fuel markets. It is evident that the transition to alternative energy is inevitable and unstoppable. It is important to note that the development of energy storage technology has improved in recent years, which means that surplus energy can be stored and used during periods when the sun or wind does not generate electricity. The more reliable the storage devices, the more attractive they are for widespread use. As a result, I believe it is possible and necessary to move from fossil to alternative energy in order to ensure a sustainable future.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.; If you want to write an essay about the above task, you should also include the following in your answer: While human needs for farming, housing and industry are necessary for economic development and social stability, I believe that we must not underestimate the importance of protecting endangered animals. The problem of how to balance human needs and the protection of animals is a difficult one. If bees are endangered, crop pollination will be damaged, and crops are necessary for human survival. Because endangered animals are key species in their ecosystems, their disappearance can have devastating consequences for food chains and damage the natural environment that people need to survive. This means that we are in danger of ignoring the effects of our actions on the future of our planet, as the deforestation of the Amazon for farming and industry will lead not only to the loss of many species of animals, but also to a change in climate, which will endanger human life. Moreover, the expansion of farmland, industry and housing often happens at the expense of the animal's environment, leading to irreversible loss of biological diversity. Protecting natural habitats not only protects animals, but also creates economic benefits for tourism and conservation. Eco-tourism is a growing industry, and it relies on a variety of wildlife. You can see, therefore, that balancing conservation and development is not only a moral obligation, but also a practical solution to ensure the long-term survival of the human race and the earth.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.; The essay should be about one thousand words in length. A debate on the benefits of learning a foreign language in its native country versus in a foreign country is an important debate in the globalization world. In my opinion, the benefits of learning a language in its native country are several. When learning Spanish in Spain, students will have the opportunity to speak with native Spanish speakers, listen to the native dialects and learn the idioms that cannot be fully taught in the classroom in another country. Students will have the opportunity to meet and speak with native speakers, and the practice will continue after the classroom. The knowledge of the culture and language is a learning tool that will help students learn and use the language. In addition, the motivation to learn the language can be greatly enhanced in an enviornment where the language is spoken. Whether ordering food, asking for directions or participating in social events, students learn the language and improve their fluency. In conclusion, although learning a language in any context can be beneficial, learning a language in its native country has unparalleled benefits. For many language learners, the desire to communicate with locals and sloop through daily life in a foreign language is a strong incentive to learn the language. These advantages of the opportunity to learn, use and understand a foreign language in its native country enhance the experience and make the language learning process more effective for many learners.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules."; I think that a combination of academic and physical education is very important for the overall development of students. In the first place, physical exercise is an important part of the health and welfare of students. Regular physical activity has many health benefits, such as improved heart health, stronger muscles and bones, and a lower risk of obesity. Schools should include physical education classes to help students fight obesity and other health problems that many young people are experiencing today. In our technological age, children and adolescents need to be encouraged to be active and playful. Physical education also has many benefits for mental health. Students who are physically active are less likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. They also feel better about themselves. Furthermore, regular physical exercise develops important life skills such as leadership, discipline, and teamwork. By participating in group sports and activities, students learn to work together, be patient, and manage stress, which is important for the classroom and beyond. Thus, physical education is not only an important element of the school program, but also a basic component that helps and improves academic learning. The combination of both physical and academic education is essential for a student's success. Finally, academic education is of course important, but physical education is an essential part of educating a healthy, happy, and balanced person.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.; In my opinion, the first advantage of studying while working is that students develop important life skills. Many argue that students should concentrate on their studies, but I believe that a job during adolescence has many advantages and should be encouraged, as long as it is done correctly. For example, a teenager who works part-time while doing his homework develops the ability to deal with multiple tasks at once, which is essential for life in a fast-moving world. Such skills are not only useful for academic success, but also for future career development. Furthermore, a student working as a cashier or in a restaurant learns the importance of customer service, teamwork and personal financial management, which goes beyond the classroom and helps the student to grow. The second advantage is that a student who works while studying can see the realities of the working world and develops an independent, self-reliant character. Also, many students contribute to the cost of school supplies, extra-curricular activities or savings for college. The additional income helps the teenager and the family to overcome some financial difficulties. The third advantage is that working and studying should be balanced, because too much work can lead to burnout and a decline in performance at school. With appropriate guidance and support, part-time work can help teenagers make a successful transition to adulthood. To conclude, although there are some valid concerns about the possible disadvantages of studying while working, the advantages of developing skills, experiencing the reality of the world of work and gaining financial independence far outweigh these disadvantages.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.; Zoos claim to protect the environment, particularly the endangered species. Although there are some zoos that can play an important role in conservation, education & research, I believe that the unethical concerns arising from the imprisonment of animals in zoos outweigh the benefits. Further, scientific studies have shown that many animals bred in captivity fail to thrive in the wild, which undercuts the success of these breeding programs. Zoos have also been shown to increase animal numbers by breeding & reintroducing animals into the wild. Although these efforts are praiseworthy, in many zoos, the main purpose is profit & it is often impossible to tell whether breeding is a conservation or an entertainment strategy. Many species show complex social behaviour & intelligence. However, in zoos, many species are kept in very restricted conditions, which do not reflect their natural environment. This can lead to psychological problems & even zoochosis, which is a term to describe abnormal animal behaviour. Further, advances in technology have made it possible to observe animals in their natural environment & virtual reality. These enable people to appreciate nature without the ethical concerns that zoos raise. The question arises as to whether it is ethical to imprison such complicated creatures in captivity for the purposes of entertainment & education. Instead of supporting a system that may harm animals, we should advocate for alternatives that are both compassionate & effective, enabling people to observe animals in their natural environment & to act as conservationists. In conclusion, zoos can have a positive educational & conservation role, but the unethical implications of imprisoning animals in a zoo are substantial.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;" I personally prefer to study alone for several reasons, which I believe enrich my study experience. First of all, I can concentrate better when I study alone. Secondly, it is a reflection of a person's learning styles and personality. For example, I can cover a topic more completely and remember it better when I work at my own pace. When I am in a quiet environment without the distractions that often accompany group study sessions, such as side conversations or different study pace, I can really sink into the subject. I could spend more time on the difficult math concepts that I struggled with last semester, which is something that might not have been possible during group study time, which was often divided between different subjects and individual needs. Besides, studying alone also allows me to design my study sessions according to my needs; I can decide what topics to cover and how long I want to spend on them, and I can take breaks whenever I feel the need to. I also find that group study, although it can be useful in terms of collaboration and obtaining different perspectives on a topic, often has disadvantages for me. Studying alone has also made me more independent and self-reliant, which is a valuable skill not only in academic pursuits, but in life in general. In sum, I believe that studying alone fits well with my focus, flexibility and self-discipline, and is thus more effective and fulfilling for me."
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.; In the following essay, I will discuss both ways of spending time with friends. When you choose to spend time with a small group of friends, you can have deeper conversations, support each other emotionally and build mutual trust. The more people you have, the easier it is to share personal thoughts and ideas, and to participate in activities that require a certain degree of mutual trust and understanding. On the other hand, spending time with many friends can bring a wider range of ideas and experience. On the one hand, it allows you to exchange ideas and opinions, and on the other hand, it is very different from small groups in that it offers you more opportunities to laugh and do different activities. In addition, it is more easy to have a large number of friends and a large social network, and that makes it easier to develop social skills and versatility. I personally prefer to spend time with a small circle of close friends because I believe that quality is more important than quantity. In conclusion, both ways have their advantages, and small groups can have deep conversations, while large groups can have social versatility, but it is up to personal preference to decide how to spend time with friends. Occasionally, I also like the active atmosphere of large parties, but the closer and more intimate relationships I have with a few special people bring me more happiness and joy.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.; Buses, trains and subways have a lot of advantages, for one thing, they are part of the solution to many problems faced by society. Both of them have strong arguments, but public transportation is a long-term solution to mobility problems faced by growing populations. And a study has shown that cities with a well-developed public transport system have less congestion, lower carbon dioxide emissions and cleaner air, which also leads to a healthier urban environment. The number of city dwellers is increasing, which increases the burden on the road system. Public transport offers an efficient and reliable alternative to private cars. Public transport creates equality and gives the poor access to work, education and other community activities. Highway expansion, on the other hand, encourages car use and urban sprawl, resulting in increased congestion and emissions in the long run. At the same time, highway expansion diverts resources away from public transport and makes the city less integrated. By choosing to invest in public transport, the government can create more sustainable, efficient and equitable cities, which are the foundation for a future of strong communities. In conclusion, while maintaining and expanding the road system is necessary, public transport is crucial for sustainable development.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.; I strongly agree with the idea that animals should not be confined in zoos because this deprives them of natural habits, life and freedom. Firstly, animals in zoos are deprived of freedom and stimulation that often leads to depression. In recent years, the debate about the rights of animals in zoos has become very lively. For example, elephants, which are known for their nomadic habits, develop severe movement disorders and problems with aggression when they are confined to small enclosures. In their natural environment, animals have complex survival habits, such as hunting, hunting and socializing. Zoos, on the other hand, are a constrained and artificial environment that does not meet their emotional and physical needs. The main purpose of a zoo is to attract visitors, which sometimes leads to the fact that the animal's natural environment is disturbed. In addition, zoos often choose entertainment over animal welfare. Zoos also allegedly serve as a means of educating people about animals, but this is only a short-term learning opportunity and does not provide a genuine insight into these animals in their natural environment. This is a well-known example of polar bears kept in warm climates, which could not get used to this and suffered from health problems. The confinement of animals in zoos has a negative effect on their mental health and welfare, and does not constitute real conservation. In my opinion, the proper conservation of animals should be based on the conservation of their natural habitats and their natural environment rather than on keeping them in captivity. Animals should not be deprived of their natural habits, life and freedom, but instead it should be protected in their natural environment.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.; Research in business can certainly lead to economic growth, but agriculture is the foundation of our economy, nutrition and the environment, and investing in agricultural research will bring tremendous benefits both immediately and in the future. In the case of my country's economy and the development of our economy, I believe that the university should first establish a research center for agricultural sciences. To the extent that agricultural research increases the productivity of farms, develops sustainable farming practices and uses modern technology, not only can we guarantee food security for the population, but also improve the livelihood of millions of farmers who depend on old-fashioned farming methods that are not adapted to the new climate. First, agriculture is the backbone of our economy, employing a large part of our population and providing us with food security. On the other hand, agricultural research can explore novel solutions to major problems, such as soil degradation, water shortages and climate change. Such solutions, such as drought-resistant crops and sustainable pest control systems, can help farmers deal with climate change. With a center for agricultural research, we can participate in international discussions about the best practices and innovations in agriculture, which could lead to international cooperation and further development. Moreover, agricultural research can strengthen the country's international position. Agricultural research can strengthen the economy and secure food security for the population and farmers. In short, a business research center can also bring benefits, but a center for agricultural research can have a significant effect on our economy, nutrition and environment.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.; I personally learn best by doing. Trying things out not only involves my senses but also makes a concept more tangible, which neither reading nor listening can do. Learning is a multifaceted activity, and people have different preferences as to how they like to learn best. I, for example, have never really learned much about chemistry by reading about it, but by doing experiments I have been able to see for myself how it works, and I believe that it is this active participation that helps me to understand the concept much better than listening or reading about it. In my last year at school, I had the opportunity to work on a school science project. I also had the opportunity to experience this method of learning when I was a volunteer at a local community center, where I was responsible for arranging different events. By mixing different substances and carefully noting the outcome, I was able to see the changes that occurred in front of my eyes and grasp the concepts better. And finally, although I acknowledge the value of other learning methods, such as reading and listening, I learn best by doing. Though we were given a set of basic guidelines when we were first trained, I found it was only when I was involved in the planning and implementation of the events that I learned what it meant to be involved in organizing events, learned how to deal with problems that arose, and learned from mistakes I made, all of which would have remained abstract if I had learned only by reading. In the future, I will seek out opportunities to learn by doing. I believe that this will lead to a more in-depth and lasting understanding.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.; Cheap air travel is the great thing that makes people of all classes able to travel further. This encourages cultural exchange, increases tourism in disadvantaged areas, expands personal horizons and benefits the world economy. The debate on cheap air travel involves both the advantages of increasing the availability of ordinary people and the disadvantages of large-scale use. But those who are against cheap air travel point to the adverse effects of mass air travel on the environment. The aviation industry is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which aggravate climate change and air pollution. For many people, the opportunity to travel is not only a luxury, but an opportunity for self-discovery and adventure, which ultimately leads to a more connected world. To my mind, however, cheap air travel offers obvious benefits, but a balance between availability and environmental protection is necessary. As air travel becomes more accessible, more people are flying, which increases the amount of air traffic and the burden on the planet's resources. For this reason, the environment advocates argue that it is essential to make air travel more expensive in order to discourage unnecessary flights and encourage more sustainable modes of transport, such as trains or buses. Also, promoting the awareness of the harmful effects of flying can make travelers plan their trips more carefully. Ultimately, the sustainable approach does not undermine freedom of travel, but makes it possible for future generations to travel without compromising the health of the planet.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.; All roads need to be maintained and improved, but it is increasingly clear that the emphasis should be on improving public transportation. The main reason for improving public transport is to reduce congestion and the negative impact on the environment. By improving the public transport system, the number of cars on the road will be reduced significantly and the air will be purified. Highways, which are necessary for moving people and goods, lead to urban sprawl and a greater reliance on personal cars. In addition, improving public transport is essential for achieving social equality. Many poor people do not have cars, so reliable public transport is an important factor in reaching schools, jobs and hospitals. This is especially important in a changing climate, when cities want to be sustainable. Also, improved public transport will stimulate the economy by bringing jobs to the region and improving accessibility. A good transport system can attract companies and lead to the development of the region, thus improving the economy. By prioritizing public transport, the government can also promote the development of all people. The population of cities is growing rapidly, and efficient, safe and sustainable transport is needed. In conclusion, although roads and highways need to be improved, the long-term benefits of improving public transport, with its positive impact on the environment, equality and the economy, makes it the most profitable choice for government spending.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.; I personally prefer to study alone. I can focus on my studies, study at my own pace and with a clear mind. This kind of debate among students is quite common, and there are advantages to both ways of studying. During exam periods, I like to go to a quiet place to study and review my lecture notes and textbooks without interruption. I can then study deeply and in-depth, without getting distracted by various opinions and comments, and I can digest it better. In addition, I can study my own way. Students have different learning styles. While some students learn well when they are discussed and discussed, I prefer to use flash cards and writing notes to learn. It is this way of studying that suits me best. Finally, studying alone helps me to develop self-discipline and self-reliance. For example, in preparing for my last history exam, I created mind maps to help me connect the various events and topics in the course. This is a personal method that can be more productive and satisfying, as I can try various methods without adjusting to the consensus of the group. Because of these reasons, I believe that although studying with a group has its benefits, it does not always fit in with my own preferences and learning styles. I have to manage my time well, set my own goals and face challenges independently, which is a valuable skill not only for my academic success but also for my future work.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives."; In my opinion, industrialization has had a negative effect on the environment. The discussion on the effect of human activity on the Earth is extremely controversial. But I strongly believe that human activity has caused more harm than good to the planet. Natural disasters that occur more frequently show that the planet can no longer cope with human activity. Greenhouse gases from factories, cars and power plants have affected the atmosphere of the Earth negatively. The greenhouse effect has been the cause of climate change, which in turn causes extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of biological diversity, according to the UN Scientific Advisory Committee on Climate Change. Deforestation from logging, farming and urban expansion has led to the destruction of important and beneficial habitats. The forests, which are used as carbon sinks, are under threat of being destroyed. The destruction of forests affects the balance of nature, which has affected human health. On the other hand, human progress has led to an increase in quality of life for people, but at a high cost to the environment. Extinction of animals will disrupt the balance of the environment and therefore the survival of people. In short, human activity, while improving life, has affected the environment more negatively than positively. To ensure the sustainable future of the next generation, people must consider the impact of their actions, reduce the consumption of resources and put the health of the planet first.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest."; Considering the increasing urgency of environmental issues, I think the company would choose to protect the environment. There are many reasons to support this choice. For example, companies increasingly recognize the importance of promoting sustainable and eco-friendly practices. Extreme weather conditions and loss of natural habitat are obvious consequences of ignoring the environment. By supporting the protection of the environment, the company will not only help society, but will also gain the support and trust of consumers. As a result, companies that support the environment can improve their image and become more popular with consumers. The company will also be able to enjoy economic growth and sustainable development. It is a win-win situation for both the company and the environment. Besides, there is an opportunity for innovation. For example, companies can invest in new energy, conservation technology and sustainable agriculture, thus attracting the attention of talented individuals and encouraging creativity. The interconnection of the environment and society affects all aspects of life, including art. A bad environment will affect the expression of art and the appreciation of art. In contrast, although support for the arts is very important for the preservation and development of culture and civilization, it is not as urgent as supporting the environment at this time.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.; It is my opinion that the main characteristics of a good co-worker are communication skills, reliability and adaptability. In today's dynamic and diverse workplace, effective co-workers can significantly affect productivity, morale and job satisfaction. Those who can communicate well can not only share tasks but also reduce misunderstandings, resulting in more efficient and effective project results. For example, if a member of a marketing team expressed his creative ideas and made critical comments, it would help to increase the exchange of ideas and innovations. A reliable co-worker can also increase teamwork and trust. Therefore, a good co-worker should encourage communication and clarify expectations to encourage collective efforts. In particular, in the case of a high-stakes project, where every contribution is interconnected, the co-workers' mutual trust and support will be increased, resulting in a highly productive work environment. For example, if a member of a research team is able to produce high-quality data and complete it on time, he will make the team feel more confident and cooperate more willingly. A good co-worker who is willing to learn and be flexible is also very important, especially in a fast-changing environment. For example, when the trend changes, the plan for developing new products must be changed. Co-workers who can adapt to new conditions can help the whole team and overcome unexpected difficulties. The willingness to change and learning will not only reduce the burden on the group, but also promote innovation. Finally, the successful co-worker should be able to communicate well, be reliable and be flexible, which can not only lead to a good working environment, but also contribute to the individual's success and the success of the group.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.; I think that success can be reached through hard work and that it is not possible without luck. But the question of success without luck is debatable. For example, such illustrious figures as Thomas Edison, who once said that “genius is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration,” demonstrate how the tireless pursuit of excellence can lead to innumerable achievements. Firstly, hard work is undoubtedly an essential part of success. People who are devoted to their studies, sports or business, are more likely to have skills, abilities and the willpower to achieve success. Even though a person may work very hard, he or she may be at the mercy of circumstances beyond their control. Edison’s invention of the electric light bulb was the result of his thousands of experiments and endless perspiration. However, he also had good connections and his timing was perfect. Even though a person may be a gifted athlete, he or she may not make the Olympic team if they are injured or outperformed by another athlete. Hard work and luck can complement each other and this gives us a better understanding of what success is. In conclusion, success is not possible without hard work, but it is also impossible without luck.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.; For example, it can be said that the distance learning method is a kind of learning method that can be used by many people, and at the same time a kind of flexibility. This kind of learning method has many advantages over the traditional classroom learning method. These advantages are particularly beneficial for people who do not have a fixed schedule for learning, such as working people or family women, and it is also an advantage for those who can't go to the class at a fixed time. In addition, it is also possible to accommodate a variety of learning styles, for example, digital platforms can be equipped with multimedia tools such as videos, games, quizzes, and discussions, which can promote learning and interest. And education. , so that more people can have the opportunity to study. It is also noteworthy that some of the distance learning methods have the characteristics of individualized learning, that is, analyzing the student's progress and providing a more appropriate teaching program. However, it should also be noted that the importance of communication in a real classroom cannot be ignored. To conclude, distance learning and online courses have many advantages, mainly in terms of flexibility and individualization. But a person-to-person contact is needed to promote socialization and learning. Therefore, although there are many advantages in learning, it should not replace the traditional classroom teaching. The way to integrate distance learning into the school curriculum is a balance between the advantages of the two, and this is also a direction for schools to go.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.; A: In my opinion, attendance at university classes should be compulsory for students. Even though there is something to both opinions, I support the view that going to classes should be compulsory for students. As young people, having just finished high school, may be unfamiliar with a framework where attendance is compulsory, they are more likely to learn essential habits of punctuality, discipline, and responsibility. Besides, students are often so caught up in their own studies that it is difficult to know which are the most important. The establishment of a compulsory system would force students to focus on their studies, thus encouraging the development of such essential habits as punctuality, discipline, and responsibility. And the opportunity to meet other students and discuss the problems that arise are of great help to them in mastering the difficult subjects. Secondly, compulsory attendance would encourage interaction with fellow students and lecturers, thus enabling them to discuss, to critically think, and to work together on projects, all of which would be difficult to achieve in solitary study or through the Internet. Apart from these, students would develop such skills as public speaking, teamwork, and the ability to communicate effectively with other people, all of which are important in a professional setting. Moreover, the relationships that are built up in the classrooms may lead to future contacts and collaboration, which will help to further their education and careers. In my view, therefore, universities should make attendance compulsory in order to help students learn discipline, the ability to communicate, and to acquire other skills. In sum, though the freedom to study is attractive, the benefits of compulsory attendance—the development of discipline, the learning of vital skills, and the strengthening of interpersonal relationships—far outweigh the disadvantages.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.; For example, in a small town, there is a sense of community. Slowly, it is connected to nature. When comparing small towns and big cities, I feel that small towns have more attractions than big cities. In a small town, festivals, gatherings, and conversations in the streets provide the opportunity for friendship and support, which is difficult to establish in the hustle and bustle of a big city. Residents know their neighbors, so there is a sense of being together, and it is a good way to live. Moreover, small towns generally move at a slower pace. Without the tension and turmoil of city life, people are relaxed and more peaceful. More importantly, compared to big cities, it is much more quiet, and the living environment is more peaceful, because it is near nature and the environment, and the people living there are healthier and more comfortable. I believe that small towns provide the ideal environment for people's happiness and happiness. Finally, although there are advantages in big cities, small towns, with their strong community, slower pace and closeness to nature, are more in line with my personal preferences.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.; One of the main reasons for young people moving to cities is the availability of education. This has become a very important trend in many countries in recent years. Many students from rural areas have to move to cities to get a higher education. Schools in the city often have good universities, various kinds of schools and extra-curricular activities, which can help a student to become a better person. The city also offers many job opportunities with high salaries compared to rural areas, which often have limited employment opportunities. The opportunity for a better life and career is also very important for many young people. In addition, city life has some disadvantages, such as higher living costs, crowding and the lack of jobs. Despite the advantages of this movement, there are also disadvantages. The depopulation of rural areas will have an adverse effect on the local economy and services. These disadvantages need to be weighed against the advantages of the individual. Although I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, the general benefits of this trend for the country as a whole must be taken into account. In the end, I believe that young people from rural areas are mainly moving to cities for better education and job opportunities.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.; Before everything else, basic economics provides students with useful life skills. First of all, as the world becomes more and more interconnected and complex, young people should know economic concepts for their future, both personal and professional. For example, when they go to college, they will be able to manage their own finances more efficiently, plan for further education and understand the impact of debts. Secondly, in our consumer society, where young people are often subjected to commercials and ads, knowing the basic economics of supply and demand, budgeting and money management can give them the power to make more informed decisions about their spending and saving habits. Thirdly, it provides a framework for understanding the big social issues, such as unemployment, inflation and government policy, which have a direct impact on their lives but remain very abstract without formal education. In conclusion, high school students are not only better equipped, but also better prepared, to contribute to the economy, whether as entrepreneurs, informed voters or responsible consumers. Finally, it can inspire students to pursue careers in finance, business and public policy. It encourages critical thinking, equips students with practical skills and teaches them to understand the economic forces that shape our world.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.; A restriction of university education to the very best students may seem logical: these are people with strong motivation, intelligence and the ability to do well in a highly demanding environment. There are arguments on both sides of the dispute, but despite the merits of both, I strongly believe that a more inclusive approach to higher education is beneficial to society as a whole. On the other hand, a broader access to university education contributes to a more equitable society. It is argued that, by concentrating resources and opportunities on the brightest students, universities can maintain high standards and accustom them to the challenges of professional life. But this does not take into account the varied talent and potential that lies outside of the academic framework. Also, education is not only about academic skills, but also about personal development, critical thinking and social growth. The widening of access to higher education benefits society by creating a more diverse workforce, rich in talent and diversity. By opening up university education to a broader range of young people, we create a more dynamic and tolerant society that values each person's unique contribution. University education can change the lives of people and give them the tools they need to make a positive contribution to their communities.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.; I fully agree that a country's health budget should be directed from spending on cures to spending on health education and preventative measures. Such a refocus would have several implications for public health, economic efficiency and overall quality of life. Firstly, by investing in health education, the occurrence of preventable diseases can be reduced significantly. For example, campaigns promoting regular physical activity and a healthy diet can make people healthier and reduce the burden of care from diseases that are largely preventable. Through education about healthy lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise and mental health awareness, people can take more active measures against diseases such as diabetes, heart problems and obesity. By detecting health problems early, one can avoid expensive hospitalizations and complicated procedures, thus saving the state a significant amount of money, which can be used to support further preventive measures. Secondly, preventive measures are often cheaper than cures. Immunizations and screenings such as breast and cervical cancer can greatly reduce the long-term financial burden of treating chronic diseases. Furthermore, a healthy population means higher productivity and economic growth. By reducing the time spent on sick leave, people can more effectively contribute to society and the economy. With a focus on prevention, countries can develop a healthier population, reduce health costs and improve the quality of life for their citizens, making such an approach not only desirable, but necessary. In short, redirecting a significant portion of health budgets from cures to health education and preventive measures is a responsible policy that can be equated with health management on the basis of long-term thinking and sustainability.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.; I strongly disagree with this idea. Although the pressures on young people to excel academically are undeniable, I firmly believe that subjects such as physical education and cooking should be retained in the school curriculum, because I think they play an important role in the education of the whole person. As is well known, regular physical activity can improve concentration and mental performance, which in turn can improve academic performance. Therefore, rather than detracting from the achievement of academic success, physical education can help to achieve it by keeping a student healthy both mentally and physically. Also, in an era when a healthy diet is important, the ability to prepare healthy food is essential. As a result, students are more independent and self-confident, which also makes them more successful both academically and physically. In addition, the pressure to succeed academically can lead to burnout and mental health problems. Subjects such as cooking can offer a welcome distraction from the academic demands of the curriculum, and in this way can reduce the level of stress. Finally, cooking can be a source of creativity and a way of dealing with problems that can also be transferred to academic subjects. I therefore think that while it is important to encourage academic success, it is also important to ensure that a school provides a balanced education, and to teach children how to achieve success in all areas of life. In conclusion, although the pressure to succeed academically is unquestionable, subjects such as cooking and physical education can create a more balanced learning environment in which students can develop a wide range of skills, interests and social skills.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.; When people move to a new country, they are often faced with a choice between adopting the customs of their new country or retaining their own customs. Both options present their own advantages and disadvantages, and they reflect different attitudes towards identity, nationality and the integration process. To adapt to the new country's customs may improve the chances of employment as employers are usually more willing to employ people who have knowledge of local culture and who are able to fit into their work environment. In particular, taking part in local festivals and observing local holidays can give a better understanding of the new country, improve the quality of community and strengthen the ties with the local population. To keep one's own customs, on the other hand, can give a sense of continuity and belonging to the new country, which can help to overcome the difficulties associated with relocating to a new country. It can also enrich the cultural diversity of the new country, which can enrich the fabric of the new country. I prefer a balanced approach that includes a mixture of the new and the old. For example, immigrant festivals enrich local culture and contribute to the unity of different ethnic groups. While individuals can continue to enjoy their roots, they can also adapt to their new environment, thus enriching their lives and the lives of the new communities. This mixed identity can promote personal growth and strengthen the unity of different ethnic groups and mutual respect.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.; I think that, on balance, it is more important to be able to work with a group of people on a task. There are several reasons for this: the benefits of a variety of perspectives, increased creativity and the development of social skills. The ability to work effectively in a group or on one's own is an essential skill in both academic and professional environments. For example, if a group of students are preparing a project for a marketing class, each of them will bring his own experiences and skills to the task, and the resulting campaign will be much better than if each of them had tried to do it alone. First of all, working in a group allows you to make use of a variety of perspectives and experiences. Each of the group members has his own knowledge and skills, which can lead to a more creative solution to the problem. In today's world, most jobs require collaboration, so it is essential to develop the ability to work well with others. In addition, group work develops a sense of community and communication skills. However, working alone has its own advantages, such as encouraging personal responsibility and personal creativity. For example, employees in a company must work together to meet their goals. The experience of collaborating with colleagues not only improves the quality of work but also builds trust and strengthens relationships that are essential for future work. In conclusion, although the ability to work alone is an important skill, the benefits of working in a team make it essential for today's world. It is becoming more and more common for successful projects to be built on a team, which leads to a shared sense of achievement and shared morale. It also increases creativity and problem solving and helps people to succeed in the world, which is becoming more and more of a team game.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.; In my opinion, I strongly agree that smoking should not be allowed in restaurants and that state laws that prohibit smoking should be upheld. First of all, there is a very big danger for the health of the smokers themselves and of course for non-smokers. In my opinion, the advantages for restaurants and for the restaurant industry as a whole from smoke-free places, from a more pleasant dining experience and from increased revenues from these facilities, all add to the arguments for my opinion. People who eat in smoke-filled rooms are exposed to harmful substances, which is a violation of their right to a healthy atmosphere. According to the results of various studies, the effects of second-hand smoke on the health of people in the restaurant are dangerous. Second-hand smoke can lead to serious health problems, such as: bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, heart disease and even cancer. Furthermore, a smoke-free environment will make the dining experience even more pleasant and enjoyable. It will also make it easier for children and families to eat with children in a more pleasant and hospitable environment. Finally, there are economic benefits to preserving the law on smoking in restaurants. According to various studies, people will eat more often in a smoke-free environment, which is beneficial to both employees and owners. In addition, these restaurants will have more customers and more revenue, which in turn leads to more job creation. In short, smoke-free rooms are not only beneficial for health, but also for the prosperity of the food industry as a whole. Smoke-free rooms are therefore the only way to achieve a healthy, pleasant and profitable dining culture.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work."; I firmly agree with this for several reasons. First, hobbies and physical activities are an effective cure for the stress and monotony that are sometimes part of the job. To participate in hobbies and physical activities that are completely different from one's work is an essential part of maintaining a balanced and fulfilling life. Those who spend their working day in an office can relieve their boredom and refresh themselves by painting or going on a hike. In our working environment, high demands, strict deadlines and a heavy pressure can cause burnout, but it is important to relax by doing something completely different than your work. Also, one's own personal development and development of skills is often encouraged by hobbies and other activities, and it also gives a broad perspective and thus better work performance. Exercise has also been shown to have a positive effect on mental health, increase energy and reduce fatigue, which in turn increases the satisfaction and productivity in the workplace. For example, playing in a team increases the ability to communicate and work together, while creativity can be developed in writing and music. In short, hobbies and physical activities that are very different from one's profession not only enrich one's personal life, but also positively affect the work. During exercise, endorphins are released, which can help with the anxiety that can be part of a demanding job.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.; Presently, government is spending much money on improving roads and highways, but it should spend more on improving public transportation. The debate over whether to improve roads and highways or to develop public transportation systems is a significant aspect of urban planning and development. Although both sectors are essential for a viable transport system, the benefits of investing in public transport far outweigh those of improving roads and highways. For example, if public transport is improved, it can provide a convenient mode of transport for people who lack private cars, thereby promoting equality and mobility for all social groups. As the population of cities grows, congestion and air pollution on roads become more severe. Expansion and improvement of public transport systems can make it possible for people to leave their cars at home and alleviate congestion and lower the levels of air pollution. On the other hand, the development of public transport systems can stimulate local economies and stimulate job growth. First, a well-planned transport system can increase access to jobs, thereby promoting employment growth and reducing the unemployment rate. Second, public transport is more sustainable than expanding the road network. The construction and maintenance of roads destroys the environment and increases the greenhouse effect, while the development of public transport is more in keeping with the new green economy and international initiatives to combat climate change. By focusing on public transport, governments can address current urban issues and provide a more sustainable and convenient future for all citizens. In conclusion, although improving roads and highways is undoubtedly important for car users, a more sustainable and sustainable future is better served by developing public transport.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.; Listening to the advice of family and friends provides the listener with a wealth of experience and insight, often based on similar experience and lessons learned. Personal experience offers unique advantages and makes it easier for a person to understand life and decide on certain things. An example of this is a friend's advice on how to deal with financial matters, which can prevent the listener from making the same mistakes. Lessons from relatives can help a person to understand relationships more clearly. The advantage of this is twofold: first, it is a form of communication, and second, it can save the listener from pitfalls. In this way, it develops a person's ability to think critically and solve problems in everyday life. On the other hand, personal experience brings the learner to a deeper understanding of life. The emotions, challenges and achievements endure in the person and help him or her grow. The insights of family and friends can illuminate the path that lies ahead, but personal experience helps people to cross it with authenticity and self-confidence. Overcoming adversity and succeeding in your own way can give you a sense of self-confidence that no advice can give you. The most important thing is that the learner should not give one of these methods the highest priority, but use both of them together. This not only broadens the view, but also increases the understanding of what life means. My opinion is that the best way to learn about life is to listen to others and go our own way.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.; One of the main reasons for the happy time of childhood is the freedom and imagination associated with this time. However, the happiness of childhood can be difficult to argue because of the complexity of individual experiences and the potential of happiness at other times in life. The relationships that children have with their families and friends give them a feeling of security and unconditional love, which adds to their happiness. Children are not burdened with the responsibilities that adulthood brings, which allows them to freely explore their surroundings, play, explore and discover, and everything seems wonderful in their young eyes. However, childhood is not always easy for some children, because there are many difficult issues to face, such as bullying, family problems, poverty, and mental health issues. This can greatly reduce the happiness of childhood. The difficulties faced by children can be long-lasting and affect their adult lives. Adults often find happiness in their achievements, relationships and personal development, and the satisfaction they experience from building their careers, establishing their families and developing their friendships is sometimes greater than the happiness of childhood. Happiness does not end with adulthood, it just changes. The possibilities of happiness vary from person to person, from person to person, and in a unique way for each person. In conclusion, childhood is a happy time, but it is not the happiest time of a person's life.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.; To begin with, the ready-made, prepared meals, which can be cooked in a jiffy, have completely changed the way we cook. Our lives have become very busy, and the ease of cooking can significantly relieve the stress of our daily life, save time and increase our overall well-being. For example, frozen vegetables and a wide range of ice creams can be prepared in a few minutes, allowing us to spend more time on family, hobbies or personal interests. Secondly, the development of technology has played a very important role in the improvement of cooking methods. The fact that parents and students have the ability to cook quickly allows them to eat a balanced meal, despite their time. In the case of slow cookers, for example, unattended cooking for several hours can turn tough meat and simple vegetables into delicious stews, which not only feeds but also helps to feel accomplished and happy. The invention of equipment such as air fryers, pressure cookers and so on offers a wide range of quick cooking methods, so that people can enjoy nutritious meals without the hassle of cooking. Also, the recipe is so easy to find and learn on the Internet that everyone can learn to cook, which can make us more creative in meal planning, and can also be a relaxing pastime and lead to a healthier relationship with food. In short, the ease of food preparation has greatly improved people's lives. How to cook faster, and what is the best equipment to help us cook more efficiently, and more importantly, how to help us cook more nourishing and more interesting dishes, all of these are very important for the well-being of our body and soul.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.; In my opinion, early independence makes young people more mature, responsible and flexible. In this way, young people are prepared for the future. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is an important step in life and can result in differing opinions about the best way to live in the same household. Young adults have to learn to budget their money, shop for food and keep the place clean. Firstly, independence helps young people develop important life skills. When you live on your own, you have to be responsible for your own daily care, such as cooking, shopping and cleaning. Furthermore, life lessons give young people the opportunity to develop their personal values. These lessons are necessary for later life. But living with your parents also has many advantages, for example, emotional support and stability during important transitions such as college or a new job. In an independent situation, you can experiment with how you want to live, which can be good for self-confidence and self-discovery. If you are willing to take these steps, it can ultimately lead to a more confident and accomplished adult life. In conclusion, although there are many advantages to living independently and staying at home, I think that early independence offers young people the best opportunity to develop their life skills and help them become more self-confident. However, if young people depend too much on their parents, they may not develop the necessary life skills and personal development.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.; In my opinion, zoos play an important role in the education of children. There are many valuable functions of zoos, from the conservation of the environment to the research and recreation of people. For example, the live shows and interactive shows help people learn about the natural habitat and the behavior of animals, thus fostering sympathy and protecting animals in the wild. Zoos also promote a close connection between people and animals. Therefore, there is a need to establish a unified education system to protect animals in the wild. In addition, the zoo can do a lot to protect endangered species by participating in breeding and research, which can protect the animals' health and improve their survival rate. The zoo is also a valuable research base for scientists and veterinarians to study animal behavior, health and breeding. For example, the successful breeding program of the Californian Condor is a typical example. In a word, although there are ethical issues in the use of zoos, it is undeniable that they are essential for people to understand the behavior of animals and to promote the conservation of our natural environment. In addition, this research can not only enrich our knowledge of the natural environment, but also help to develop better management measures for both wild and zoo animals.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;" In the first place, parents are the first to instruct their children. The influence of parents on a child’s education should not be underestimated, as it lays the foundations for a lifetime of skills, understanding, and values. The environment in which a child lives is often the best place to learn essential life skills, such as physical movement, speech, and social behavior. Children learn from their parents by observation, imitation, and communication. Apart from this, parents are able to teach their children about morals, ethics, and the importance of self-respect. This education is not just intellectual; it also includes emotional and psychological factors, such as security, trust, and the encouragement to learn. However, although parents are important in their children’s education, it is important to realize that they are not the only ones. Besides, other people, such as teachers, family, and members of the community, also have an important role to play, often bringing specialized knowledge and experiences that parents may not have. This influences the character and influences the actions and decisions of children throughout their lives. Accordingly, I am sure that parents are the most important teachers for young children. Their education is essential and will have a lasting effect on their children."
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.; One of the main concerns about the effect of television on children is the exposure to inappropriate content. Even though the medium of the radio and the picture is neutral, many people consider it to be harmful for children to watch it. Many children's programmes contain violence, abusive language and negative stereotypes. This can lead to unhealthy social perceptions and attitudes and to increased aggression. There is no doubt that if properly controlled, a child's exposure to television can have a negative effect. However, the medium can also be used as an educational tool, as a source of valuable information and as a stimulus to learning. With the emergence of streaming services, parents are better able to monitor their children's exposure to the content of their favourite shows. For example, programmes such as Sesamstraat and Blue Planet not only entertain children but also educate them in mathematics, language and environmentalism. And parents are better able to monitor their children's viewing habits, they can be better guided in the choice of suitable material and children can be exposed to the educational value of television and its influence on their own development.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.; The idea that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives is a provocative statement that deserves careful consideration. While the idea of a career in a company gives a sense of security and loyalty to employees, I do not agree with it and I believe that a more flexible form of employment is better suited to the dynamic environment of the job market today, as well as the needs of both employees and employers. The first reason is that the rapid development of technology requires businesses to be flexible in order to compete in the market. As industries evolve, the skills required to succeed in them are changing, and the long-term employment of a single company can prevent this adaptation because employees become fixed in their positions and reluctant to learn new skills. For example, the development of the information industry and the renewable energy industry has changed a lot, so the company must have the flexibility and ability to learn and change to be successful, and hiring for life will also hamper innovation and the new ideas that new employees can bring to the company, and this will affect the company's long-term success. The second reason is that employees often want to learn and develop their careers. And for the employees, they are not satisfied with the work of the company, but they want to have the opportunity to learn new things and develop their careers. In addition, the company needs new people with new skills, experiences and new ideas, and many people want to change their work. . The third reason is that employees often want to work and life balance. The rise of the freelance economy and the sharing economy shows that employees are willing to exchange security for freedom. This will benefit both the company and the employee. In summary, while the idea of hiring for life seems beneficial, it is better to consider the needs of the company and the employee and focus on continuous learning and development opportunities, which will benefit both parties.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days."; For example, children have a special ability to find happiness in the simplest things. Children are often said to be the happiest, and I do not disagree with this statement. The ability to be happy in daily events decreases with age, when adult worries can overshadow these moments of happiness. I remember that a trip to the park with friends, for example, could turn into an extraordinary adventure, a merry feast of laughter and creativity. This exuberance of children is very catching. Children are free from the work, from the taxes and from the endless social ties that adults experience every day. This freedom allows children to play, to explore and to know themselves without the burden of adult responsibilities. Moreover, childhood is a time when many of us develop the most important relationships with family and friends, and it is these memories that are often the most cherished later in life. I remember the many summer days when I explored the forest nearby, when the only worry was to get home in time for dinner. Children often spend a lot of time with their families, with their siblings, cousins, relatives and neighbors, and these early family relationships are what give us a special ability to love and enjoy. Birthdays, holidays and family celebrations are often full of love and joy and are a reminder of this love and joy. Children often have many fond memories of the happiest years of their lives, and the combination of innocence, freedom and love experienced at this time is a source of happiness that is often unmatched in later years.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future."; The thesis that learning about the past is useless for those living in the present is a misleading position. History offers the most valuable lessons, guiding our decisions and our life in the present and in the future. For example, the experience of World War II strongly influenced the world's postwar international relations and forced states to adopt multilateral agreements and diplomacy, resulting in a decrease in military conflicts. Mistakes of the past, such as the wars of nationalism or the economic collapse of the Great Depression, are good examples of the consequences of human actions and can be studied and avoided in the future. Our present lives on the experience of the past, in which cultural traditions, social practices and political systems are rooted. Furthermore, the knowledge of history gives us a sense of identity and continuity. The knowledge of historical contexts contributes to a fuller understanding of the rights and responsibilities of citizens. In addition, history trains critical thinking skills. For example, the civil rights struggles of the twentieth century illuminate our contemporary debates about fairness and justice and remind us that the fight for equality is an ongoing task that requires our constant efforts. By knowing how to analyze the historical narrative, we are better equipped to deal with complex contemporary issues such as climate change, global pandemics, and social inequality. Knowledge of historical events requires us to analyze and evaluate sources, which is an important skill in today's world where misinformation is so easy to spread. Embracing the lessons of the past enriches our understanding of the present and makes us better informed and more responsible citizens in the future. In conclusion, it would be a serious mistake to reject the importance of learning about the past.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.; For example: The expansion of space travel has captured the imagination of humanity since time immemorial, and many governments of the world have made considerable investments in space travel, although some critics argue that these investments would be better spent on pressing issues on earth, but I do not think that such an investment is not only reasonable but necessary for the future of humanity. Firstly, the expansion of space travel means the expansion of technology. For example, new materials, telecommunications and medical technology have all been developed on the basis of space exploration, and these developments will contribute to economic growth and improve the quality of life on earth. Secondly, the expansion of space travel will bring the expansion of technology and science to other areas of life on earth. Besides, space travel can be used as a source of scientific data. The study of climate change, planetary geology and the possibility of life in other worlds all rely on the data collected from space missions. This scientific knowledge can be used to address the great challenges of the future, such as environmental issues and resource depletion. Further, the search for new sources of energy and new habitations in space may become more important in the future as resources on earth become scarce. The expansion of space travel will not only open up opportunities for exploitation of other planets, but also open up the possibility of exploitation, such as the exploitation of asteroids. Finally, governments can also expect to be able to understand and prevent, and even prevent, the potential risks of future crises. But also make life on earth easier. In conclusion, although the cost of space travel is high, the technology that is developed, the scientific data that is obtained and the potential resources that can be exploited make it reasonable and necessary to make such an investment.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people."; But although it is true that communication has been changed, it has not been destroyed, but transformed. The assumption that the communication among friends and family has been destroyed, is a very provocative question. It can also be proved that the communication between family members has increased because of television. Firstly, a common interest can be a common experience between family members and friends. The best example is the family discussion about a popular soap opera, which can elicit discussion, debate and similar shared experiences among family members who watch it. Secondly, the arrival of streaming has democratized access to content from around the world, enabling family and friends to learn about different cultures and issues together. This can lead to deeper conversations about societal issues, human experiences or moral dilemmas, which can increase understanding and sympathy among those who watch it. The best examples of this are, for example, Game of Thrones or Stranger Things, which have captivated people, but also enriched the communication between the people who watch them. It is also true that too much time in front of the screen can lead to a lack of communication, because individuals will turn away from the face-to-face communication, and in this way, the radio is not only a distraction, but a tool for dialogue and reflection. In conclusion, although the radio poses some obstacles to the communication, it also provides opportunities for it. Instead of destroying communication, it should be seen as a complicated influence on the relationships between family and friends. A balanced approach is required and the best way to find a balance between the two is through moderation in front of the screen.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.; I strongly agree with the statement that letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. Firstly, letting a friend make a mistake promotes personal growth and learning. In the complicated relationship between friendship and relationships, the decision to let a friend make a mistake rather than intervene and prevent it often involves a balance between emotional risk and personal growth. Suppose, for example, that a close friend of mine is about to invest in a risky business. Although I could intervene and warn him, I would rather let him find out for himself. Everyone makes mistakes, and these experiences often represent the greatest learning experiences. By making his own mistake, he is forced to face the consequences and, as a result, becomes more aware of the consequences of his actions and therefore more aware of the importance of careful consideration. Secondly, intervening too much can lead to discomfort and resentment between friends. If he loses money, instead of losing our friendship, he learns from his mistake about the value of thinking carefully about investments and the importance of making careful inquiries before making decisions. Similarly, another friend of mine received a lot of criticism for the choice of her boyfriend. Friendship requires mutual respect and understanding. If one friend feels he is being controlled or judged, the friendship becomes strained and can eventually end. But if I had intervened to end her relationship, I might have hurt her feelings and, instead of helping her, she would have been hurt by me. In conclusion, although it is painful to see our friends make mistakes, we must not prevent them from growing up. By considering the situation carefully and experiencing the natural consequences, she made the right decision and our friendship remained strong. A friend's erroneous decision can strengthen the relationship between two people. Ultimately, it makes friendship stronger.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;" Part-time work not only provides the teenager with the opportunity to earn his or her own money, but also teaches him useful life skills that he will use later. A job at this age is an opportunity to learn responsibility. It teaches him to balance his activities, to manage his time, to meet his deadlines, which will be very useful to him later when he starts college or a career. As a result, it will be easier for him to learn time management skills in college or in the career. This not only improves his or her ability to work as a team, but also helps to increase their ability to adapt and face new challenges. Part-time work also exposes teenagers to the outside world, where they can develop communication skills and teamwork. Money, especially, is a very important value for a teenager to learn and understand; and once they earn it themselves, they can learn to budget, save and spend it wisely. A job also encourages teenagers to be financially literate. Finally, by engaging in part-time work, teenagers can also explore their career interests, and be exposed to various jobs and industries, which can help them find their interests and hobbies, which are very useful for them when they grow up and have to manage their own money. In addition, the parents can also help their children make important decisions about their future career and education. In short, allowing teenagers to take part-time jobs is an important way for parents to prepare their children for the complexity of adult life."
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.; To some extent, the city provides children with a lot of benefits, such as access to knowledge and a broader cultural outlook. But on the other hand, growing up in the countryside has its own advantages that are more conducive to the growth of children. Firstly, children in the countryside are more likely to have close contact with nature and thus a deep respect for nature. But in the city, children are often exposed to air pollution and traffic congestion, which are harmful to their health. The more time children spend in nature, the better their ability to concentrate and the less stress they have. The more time children spend in nature, the more likely they are to learn farming, walking, and exploring the local environment, and the more they are encouraged to be creative and adventurous. In addition, the country is the place where people live together. In this environment, children learn the spirit of cooperation and empathy. In addition, children in the countryside are more likely to be safe. In big cities, children are close to many peers, but they are isolated from them due to the fast-paced, competitive, and self-interested nature of city life, and are more likely to feel lonely and anxious. In addition, the low crime rate and traffic congestion in the countryside can give children more freedom to explore their environment, so they are more likely to be independent and confident. The relationship between family and relatives is more intimate, and they have a strong sense of belonging. Children are more likely to develop in a more harmonious, healthy, emotional, social and physical environment.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.; I disagree with the statement that parents are the best teachers, though I do not disagree with the idea that they teach life lessons and important values. The complexity of the learning environment goes far beyond the family. For example, an experienced teacher can teach his students in many ways, through a variety of methods, such as using multi-media tools, group discussions and experiments, which a parent, who has not received such a level of education, will not be able to do. Secondly, teaching is not just in the family environment. There are many different pedagogical methods used by teachers to teach a variety of learning styles. In addition, the social learning environment in schools cannot be ignored. Schools are like a microcosm of the world, where children learn to work together with their peers and communicate with people outside their families. Besides, teachers provide access to a large amount of knowledge and a wide range of subjects that a parent can't afford. Parents can, however, be said to be the first educators, because they are the first to teach children important values and guide them through their first life lessons. However, children who have been taught by their parents may lack these basic social skills, which are necessary for success in life. However, formal education, social skills and teachers' professional skills all contribute to the full development of a child. In conclusion, parents can teach children the importance of honesty and respect, which can serve as the foundation for further education.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.; There are several changes in food preparation. Firstly, technology has facilitated the cooking process, which is very helpful for people. This change has improved the life of people in general. The first thing is that people spend less time cooking. For example, a working mother can now prepare a healthy dinner for her family in thirty minutes, whereas before the invention of these devices, it could take hours. This not only suits the fast-paced lifestyle of modern people, but also makes it possible for families to have dinner together and build closer family relationships. The next advantage is that people eat more healthily. When people have access to easy-to-use ingredients, they are more likely to cook at home than to go to restaurants, and this is also a healthy habit, because they can make more nutritious food according to their own needs and dietary preferences. In addition to making life more convenient, food preparation has also improved people's eating habits. In addition, the cultural value of food preparation has not been lost, but has been developed. For example, people who want to lose weight, in order to lose weight, they can eat lean meat and fresh vegetables, and avoid the high-calorie food from the restaurant. Also, there are many different kinds of food around the world, and people with little knowledge of cooking can also learn to cook various delicious dishes. To sum up, the convenience of food preparation has definitely improved the way people live. In conclusion, the ease of cooking food is a big improvement in modern life.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.; and to ensure that educational institutions maintain a consistent standard of learning and accountability. In the current era of education, the debate about the need for standardized testing is widespread and necessary. Proponents of standardized testing argue that these tests are the best indicators of whether students are learning or not. These tests are designed to be used as a standard for measuring knowledge across different subjects and grade levels, which enables teachers to determine gaps in learning, focus on specific subjects and track progress. Moreover, regular testing can instill a sense of discipline and commitment in students. Students are aware of the dates and deadlines for the tests and thus know their weaknesses and strengths. It also enables teachers to determine the effectiveness of teaching methods and the curriculum, and thus to make decisions about the distribution of resources and the direction of future reforms. The opposition to standardized testing usually cites the pressure and anxiety it creates for students. However, if implemented thoughtfully, standardized tests can be made less tense, such as using practice tests, giving students enough time to prepare and designing tests that suit the ability of different students. This increases the motivation of both students and teachers to achieve excellence in education. Standardized testing provides a means to continuously improve teaching and learning, bringing the ultimate goal of academic success and mastery to life. In conclusion, it is appropriate for students to take standardized tests.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate."; ... I firmly agree that higher education should be available to everyone regardless of their ability to pay for it. To begin with, access to university education for all, without regard to ability to pay, is a way to promote equality and personal development and a solution to the problem of a major skills gap. This means that talented people can realize their full potential regardless of their social or financial background. The main reason is that many students are discouraged from pursuing higher education by the high costs of education and society loses their talent and potential. Free university education would encourage students to study subjects that interest them and not just to make money. This would lead to greater innovation and creativity, and the freedom of education would allow people to cope with the complex world of today. Free university education would also promote personal and social development. Besides, an educated workforce is necessary for economic growth. The higher the level of education, the greater the increase in productivity and innovation. In addition, a highly educated workforce is able to develop and adapt to new labor markets. In conclusion, I can only say that university education should indeed be free for all those who wish to go. To sum up, I think that free university education is not only a means of equality between students from different backgrounds, but also a way to promote personal and social development, and a major step towards a prosperous and equitable society.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.; Teaching and research are two important aspects of a university's work, but education is the heart of the university's mission, preparing students for the work force and preparing them for the future. I think that education should be the main thing professors should do, though research is still a big part of the professors' work. There are two reasons why I say that: one is that when professors spend more time teaching, they can create a lively classroom environment and stimulate students' interest in learning, and students can understand complex concepts in a more effective way. Also, because of their individualized attention in the classroom, students can grasp the complex ideas of the subject better, which can also be extended to life outside the classroom. The second reason is that, although research is an important aspect of academic work, it is not the only important aspect, and it is undeniable that it is an important aspect of academic work. The innovation of knowledge, the importance of the reputation of the university, and the accumulation of funds and talents can all be achieved through research. But in the end, the ideal situation is to balance the teaching and research. If the professors are very busy with research, they will hardly have time to help and guide the students, which will also affect the learning of students. The professors, of course, will continue to conduct research, but they should not give up their responsibility as educators. With the achievements of their own research, they should put their research into the curriculum, so that the students can get the most out of their research, and the knowledge they have acquired can be used as a foundation for their future.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.; In the first place, the behavior of the characters in the story can be imitated. This can be understood through the idea of imitation, desensitization and realism. Furthermore, children can learn good behavior from watching superheroes on the box. On the other hand, watching violent films can make impressionable people more violent. The same behavior can also be seen in the group of people who watch horror movies, for example, who are then more violent. Second, repeated exposure to the same themes and stories can cause desensitization, so that people become less sensitive to violence or moral dilemmas that appear in the media. One example of this is the so-called 'copycat effect', in which a number of real-life copycats are seen in the aftermath of violent films. These desensitizations also change the way we think about crimes, causing us to become less empathetic and more prone to violence. Thirdly, our view of reality can be influenced by television and films. For example, action film spectators may learn to regard violence as a way of dealing with conflict, which then affects the way they deal with conflict situations in their daily lives. Reality shows also show a distorted view of reality, and this can lead to the viewer trying to imitate the lavish life shown on the screen. In short, the perception of reality and the norms of society are distorted by these media. As the media continue to evolve, it is important for people to critically judge what they watch to reduce the negative influence on behavior and society. In conclusion, television and film have a strong influence on behavior through the effect of imitating, desensitizing and influencing perception.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.; The first reason is that museums are the most convenient way to learn about the history and culture of a country. When people travel to a new place, they often choose to visit museums because of the following reasons. If you go to the British Museum in London, you can see ancient Egyptian mummies and Greek sculptures, which are the remains of ancient civilizations. Through these artifacts, people can not only understand the history of the world, but also understand the cultural background of the country they visit. In the Louvre in Paris, people can touch the Mona Lisa and the statue of Venus de Milo. It is more meaningful to experience these works than to see them on the Internet or in books. The second reason is that museums are the best place to show art and creativity. The Third is that people feel closer to the local community when they visit museums. Many museums hold lectures, exhibitions and other activities that encourage communication and exchanges. This interaction is the most enriching part of a traveler's experience. Museums are also the best place for tourists to learn about local culture. For example, if a museum in a small town is a local community museum, it shows the works of local artists and local history. Visitors can communicate with locals in such a setting, learn their ideas and learn their culture.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.; I do not agree with this statement, and I think that in the hustle and bustle of daily life, the feeling of humanity and civility are more important than others. In other words, the feeling of humanity, and the feeling of belonging, are very important in the world of cold communication. Firstly, politeness can be a lubricant in social life, and in a chaotic and crowded public transport and business environment, the simplest civility such as saying thank you and please, can make people feel happier and more cooperative. It is very important in the case of excessive pressure. Secondly, it is a good thing to expect civility, which can encourage a spirit of kindness and respect for others. Lastly, it is important to realize that the civility is not in contrast to the realities of modern life, and we can be more sensitive to the feelings of others. So we can not only improve the individual's relationship, but also contribute to the formation of the harmonious society. In short, I think that instead of releasing the expectation of civility in the crowded world, we should firmly rely on it. Although people are imperfect, they should not give up the pursuit of civility.
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.; Life is full of challenges that test our courage, patience and understanding. Although they are often difficult or painful at the time, they often become turning points for us and are crucial in the development of our personality. I totally agree with the statement that most of the difficult experiences we go through become valuable lessons in the future. It is important to think of the experience of failing an exam for example, at the time this failure may seem devastating, and disappointment and doubt about oneself may follow. But later one realizes that failure is just an opportunity to find out about oneself. This new way of studying will improve both the subject and the person's attitude to it, and also give us the courage to face new challenges. Moreover, the ability to withstand adversity is an important skill for both personal and professional life. Although unemployment is a difficult and frustrating experience at the time, it can also lead to new careers, further study and even starting a business. Lastly, many difficult experiences enrich our sympathy and understanding for others. When we are faced with hardships, we become more aware of the hardships of others and, therefore, we are more able to offer support and guidance. The experiences we go through are important in that they teach us to be strong, they teach us to be self-aware, and they teach us to understand the difficulties that others face. In conclusion, although difficult experiences are often disappointing at the time, they can be invaluable life lessons.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.; For a lot of reasons. First of all, cities are large economic centers where there are many different industries, for example, agriculture, small businesses, finance, medicine and the entertainment industry. For this reason, cities are cultural centers where there are many opportunities for recreation, eating and having fun. In addition, there are theaters, galleries, concert halls, restaurants, nightclubs, discos, bars, a variety of festivals, concerts, etc., and all this makes life in a city more fun. Besides economic and cultural advantages, cities are also known for better health care and education. There are famous hospitals, clinics, schools and universities in the cities. As a result, people from different nationalities gather in cities and, with their ideas and experiences, enrich the urban social fabric. Besides, the city is the place where the most developed public sphere is established. The most developed spheres are: public transport, public education, social and legal services. All this is useful for personal and professional development. The city is much more convenient for those who are looking for opportunities, opportunities and entertainment. Although life in the country is quiet and beautiful, but life in the city is diverse, rich in opportunities and opportunities. All this is achieved by a developed public sphere, which reduces the need for cars, and therefore, lessens congestion and has a favorable effect on the environment, in contrast to the narrow public transport and high dependence on cars in rural areas.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.; First, our job is often our main source of income, which gives us the means to afford necessities such as food, housing and health care. Our job not only provides us with a living, but also shapes our identity, relationships and personal fulfillment. Second, the living environment can affect our happiness negatively. People who have boring jobs in boring places sometimes take solace in the comfort they afford with their income, but if they don’t have any security, the most beautiful living environment can be very tiring and annoying. Third, our work plays an important role in our satisfaction. Engaging in meaningful work can bring people a sense of accomplishment and purpose. Regardless of where you live, people who work meaningfully are happier. Also, our work is the center of our social relationships. For example, doctors can help people feel happy, so they don’t have to worry about their living environment. In contrast, people who live in boring and lonely environments are very isolated and lonely, despite the comfort they have. In addition, the social support in the workplace can make people more content and more stable, which can make them happier. People are generally happier when they work than when they live. In conclusion, although our job and living environment both have an effect on our happiness, our work has a greater influence.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.; I like to communicate with people face to face because I can see them. In the digital age, people have many different ways to communicate with each other. E-mail and voice mail don’t allow people to see each other and to read facial expressions. This is why e-mail and voice mail often lead to misunderstandings and do not allow people to make personal connections. But when people talk to each other face to face, they can see each other’s body language and facial expressions. When people talk to each other face to face, they can easily see each other’s body language and facial expressions. Also, face-to-face communication builds stronger relationships. For example, during important discussions and negotiations, people can easily see each other’s reactions, which can help them to reach a better understanding or resolve their differences. On the other hand, e-mail and voice mail offer the advantages of convenience and time to reflect before responding, but they do not offer the immediate, personal contact of face-to-face communication. In addition, face-to-face communication leads to more active and dynamic discussions. In real time, people can share their experiences, their laughter, and even their problems, and this can help them to form stronger bonds than those that are created by virtual communication. In short, I believe that while digital communication methods have their place in today’s fast-paced world, they do not offer the richness and immediacy of face-to-face communication, which helps people to understand each other and build strong relationships. As a result, I prefer to communicate with people in person whenever possible.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close."; Many people claim that people can not talk to each other because they spend too much time watching TV. However, I disagree. I believe that when you moderately use it, you can increase the communication between people, especially among family members. For example, a family can gather together to watch a popular series or a movie they are interested in. In this way, the experience of watching a series or movie together can promote conversation, make people laugh and create shared memories. Secondly, a wide variety of educational and current events shows on TV can stimulate communication between people. This encourages discussion, the analysis of the choices made by the characters, and the expression of personal views. This encourages the conversation to be deeper and more meaningful, rather than leading to a more separated life. Furthermore, with the development of science and technology, social media have also become an important part of the media. Many people are discussing their favorite episodes at the same time on different platforms, which makes it easy for friends to discuss and interact in real time, even if they are not together. This means that families and friends can have more meaningful discussions about the world, about culture and about science, which can increase their understanding and compassion for each other. If people can see that it is a way to promote communication rather than a barrier to it, they can also understand the role of media in modern relationships. In conclusion, although it is easy to use too much TV and social media, it is still possible to increase communication between family and friends.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.; In today's world, people have many ways to convey their thoughts and feelings, ranging from e-mails and voice mails to telephone calls and face-to-face conversations. Although all of these forms of communication have advantages and disadvantages, I prefer face-to-face conversations for several reasons. You can read the other person's facial expressions, the movement of their eyes, their smiles, their frowns, and so on. In other words, face-to-face conversations allow people to communicate more deeply with each other. In contrast, written words may sometimes be ambiguous or misleading, especially without the tone and intonation of a spoken language. This rich idiom increases understanding and empathetic understanding, thus improving the quality of the conversation. Moreover, face-to-face conversations are often conducive to teamwork and creativity. During the conversation, you can immediately ask questions or make clarifications, ensuring that you and your partner are on the same page. This is especially important for complex and difficult conversations where clarity is the most important. And while e-mails and voice mails may be convenient and efficient, I firmly believe that they can't replace the advantages of face-to-face conversations. For example, brainstorming sessions in person often allow ideas to flow in ways that would otherwise be stifled by more isolated communication forms. In short, e-mails and voice mails are convenient and easy, but I believe that they can't replace face-to-face conversations. In this way, face-to-face conversations are the gold standard for communication.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.; I completely agree with the statement: “Haste makes waste”, and this is not a superficial statement. When we hurry to do our work, the quality of our work often decreases, and we are unable to make the most of our work, and we may miss the opportunity to do better. In a professional context, hasty decisions may lead to expensive blunders. For example, a student who has to finish a task too quickly may make a few mistakes, which not only bring down the grades but also cost time and money. Then, haste can also impede learning and personal growth, because when we hurry, we often skip important steps in the process of solving problems, which inhibits creativity and limits innovation. A marketing team that does not do enough research on a campaign may make the wrong message and hurt the credibility of the brand. It is therefore better to reflect and think about the problem to make the result more reasonable and more effective. It is also important to consider the psychological consequences of haste. For example, a developer who is in a hurry to develop a product may ignore some improvements or features that could be added to the product to make it mediocre and unsatisfactory, and even ignore customer needs. In addition, people who work at their own pace, can sort out their tasks, set goals, and manage their time better are often more satisfied with the results. The last but not the least, constant haste leads to pressure, which is detrimental to productivity and motivation. If we take our time to think carefully, we can do a better job and make our work more pleasant and more meaningful.
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.; In my opinion, the car has improved our lives in some ways, but the problems it has caused should also be seriously considered. The automobile has undoubtedly transformed modern life by providing increased mobility and convenience. But this progress is accompanied by serious problems that cannot be ignored. One of the major advantages of cars is the ability to move from one place to another in a few minutes, so that people have access to new job opportunities, education, and entertainment. The economy also benefits from this increased mobility, as people can drive further to work, thus expanding labor markets and increasing productivity. The biggest disadvantage of cars, however, is their negative impact on the environment, and their air and noise pollution are dangerous to the health of city dwellers. There is also a serious problem with the road safety in the city. Heavy traffic leads to more car accidents every year and is related to the increase in the number of traffic accidents. In my opinion, a combination of the development of sustainable transportation methods, such as public transportation and electric vehicles, can help to solve these problems and preserve the advantages of automobiles. In conclusion, although the automobile has improved life by allowing unprecedented mobility and economic opportunities, it has also caused serious problems such as pollution and traffic accidents. Despite advances in automobile safety, human errors, rash driving and inattention to the road continue to be serious risks on the road.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.; This question is not easy to answer, and there are many factors to consider. In this essay, I will argue that children should choose similar careers to their parents rather than different careers. In the first place, children are often influenced by their parents, who are their role models and their source of information about the world of work. This informal background can give the children a great advantage in the choice of a career and the direction of their education. In the second place, children have the advantage of inheriting the skills and knowledge of their parents, and can inherit the skill and knowledge of the ancestors. The parents, who have overcome the difficulties of the industry and have some contacts, can give the children some useful advice and opportunities to make connections. In the end, it is not a career without the support of the parents. A lot of parents also hope that their children will succeed in their careers, and this will give both generations a sense of belonging. The third advantage is that the family values are also passed on, and it is more valuable to be with their parents. So I think it's better for children to choose similar careers to their parents. To sum up, although children must seek their own interests and hobbies, it is also possible for them to enter the industry of their parents, and it will give them more opportunities to achieve success.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.; I firmly agree with this opinion because it may take away time and energy from school work. Secondly, too much screen time takes away from time that could be used for other things, such as reading. The debate on whether parents should limit the time children spend on watching TV and movies to ensure academic success is complex and complex. Firstly, the content of many programs can be boring and even counterproductive to learning stimulating and knowledge. Secondly, if children spend hours watching films and shows, they can ignore their homework and reading, or they can also stop having intellectual conversations with their parents. As a result, their school work will be adversely affected, and their performance in school will be affected. Thirdly, by encouraging children to do many different things outside of their screens, such as sports, reading and creative hobbies, parents can ensure that children's lives are balanced, and their physical and mental health will be improved. However, limiting the time spent on screen can also encourage children to learn more about the world around them, through documentaries, educational programs and learning games. Fourthly, the content of the program on the screen often focuses on entertainment rather than education, many children are attracted to the cartoon, X-ray, etc., they are not able to use their brains, and their thoughts are difficult to challenge. The moderation of this kind of entertainment makes children more developed, so as to ensure that they can do well in both school work and personal life. In conclusion, I think that parents should limit their children's screen time in order to promote their academic success.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.; The following situation is observed. To understand this situation, it is necessary to analyze different sides of the issue. Some say that professional athletes are overpaid, others that their salaries are justified by the particular needs of their work. Sport is a multimillion-dollar industry that draws millions of spectators to millions of fans who then convert into huge earnings from advertising, broadcasting, merchandising and sponsorship deals. In this sense, paying athletes a significant part of these earnings seems to be the natural outcome. And there are other arguments in support of the argument that athletes have a relatively short career: the peak of their career comes at the age of thirty, and injuries can drastically reduce the time of their careers. So their performance attracts fans and generates economic activity, which justifies the salary paid to them. Besides, the extraordinary effort, discipline and physical strength required to compete at such a high level are often underestimated, and so high salaries could be seen as compensation, giving them a chance to secure their financial future in a short time. In short, whether professional athletes deserve high salaries is a matter of market conditions, individual merit and society's priorities. On the other hand, some argue that the high salaries of athletes overshadow the salaries of essential workers such as teachers and health workers, thereby raising questions about the values of society and whether entertainment should take priority over essential services. In my opinion, it is necessary to reach a reasonable balance so that the athletes can get their fair share and other essential workers can get theirs. Although it seems to be exorbitant, the salary is also based on the economics of the industry.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident."; I think people who cant accept criticism are quite unable to succeed in group working. Constructive criticism does not merely reflect a persons failings, but also serves as a means of growth and improvement. The ability to accept criticism is the basis for a good team and success in group work. It is a sign of emotional intelligence, a trait that makes people capable of working in a group. People who can accept criticism are able to adjust their views or their methods when they see the need for it. This makes group members more willing to share their ideas without fear of being criticized themselves. In a group setting, the individual members may have different tasks and roles, and their views may be limited. Then, constructive criticism reveals those blind spots and enables the group to communicate more effectively, enabling a wider range of ideas to be presented and considered. With no opportunities for learning and development, the group is at risk of stagnating and the group as a whole may not function as well as it could. Also, accepting criticism from fellow workers helps the members see their own work in a different light, to improve it, and to contribute to the overall objective of the group. In short, the ability to accept criticism is essential for success in group work. If a person reacts to criticism defensively or rejects it, it creates tension, erodes trust and leads to conflict. On the other hand, accepting criticism builds up trust and enables group members to feel valued and motivated. Thus, people who have difficulty accepting criticism may be excluded from effective group working, and ultimately hinder the group from achieving success. It builds trust, enables personal and professional development, and improves group performance.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.; Music and art are able to stimulate the brain in a completely different way than science and mathematics. Both music and art encourage creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Although there is some debate about whether or not to teach music and art to children aged five to ten along with mathematics, science, history and language, there are also good arguments for including them in the curriculum. Art encourages children to express their thoughts and feelings and, in doing so, encourages emotional intelligence and self-esteem. The addition of music and art also increases the level of teamwork and collaboration. Besides, music and art improve cultural literacy and appreciation of diversity. Since music and art are often team projects, children learn to communicate and learn to appreciate different perspectives. In an increasingly globalized world, these skills are indispensable. As a final point, children will enjoy creating and performing, which can encourage their resilience and resilience. In the increasingly globalized world, such knowledge is becoming increasingly important. To sum up, the learning of music and art for young children is not only a good thing, it is also a necessity. When mental health issues are increasingly common among young people, music and art can also offer an outlet for expressing and relieving stress.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.; Firstly, by illustrating a subject’s practical application, the teacher is showing that an abstract theory can have a practical application. When students see that their learning is applicable to real life, their interest and motivation in the subject are likely to increase significantly. This can increase the students’ curiosity about the world and motivate them to learn the subject even better. For example, if a mathematics teacher explains to students that geometry is used in architecture, engineering and art, they are likely to feel more interest in geometry and find it easier to remember. For example, a science teacher may have students carry out experiments that imitate industrial or environmental testing, thereby demonstrating the practical application of the subject. Secondly, by demonstrating a subject’s practical application, teachers can cater for different learning styles. For example, some students prefer to learn by listening to a teacher lecture, but others may prefer to learn by doing, especially if the task reflects the real-life application of the subject. Students can also be more interested in learning something if they can see how it will be useful to them in their future lives. Thirdly, by demonstrating a subject’s practical application, teachers can make the subject more memorable, since they are helping the students to feel a sense of ownership in what they are learning. When they understand the relevance of what they are studying, students are more likely to feel an interest in it and develop a love of learning, which will be beneficial to them not only academically but also in their personal lives. To conclude, by relating school subjects to real life, teachers are not only helping to spark their interest but also preparing them for life after school.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?; I think this is because of several compelling reasons. In the modern world, the debate about how to divide government budgets between the protection of the environment and the development of the economy has become very important. The economic development is important for the prosperity of the country, but the protection of the environment is important for the long-term development and well-being. The environment supports the economy in many ways. For example, natural resources like clean air and water, fertile soil and biological diversity are important for agriculture, tourism and many other industries. On the other hand, the environment is degrading very fast due to the rapid changes in climate and pollution, and the economy will also be greatly affected. In the second place, the increasing occurrence and intensity of natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and forest fires, is a threat to the economic stability of a country and the built environment. Investing in environmental protection ensures that these resources can be used for economic activities in the future. On the other hand, governments are increasingly realizing that sustainable development can be a source of innovation and economic growth. Developing green technology and sustainable practices can create jobs, support new industries and attract foreign investment. So although the economy must continue to develop, it should not distract governments from the need to protect the environment. Using budgets to support sustainable development will not only protect the environment for future generations, but also build a strong and resilient economy for the 21st century. These two goals should be pursued in tandem in order to ensure that all nations can thrive.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.; First, the trend towards public transport is already visible in many large cities. This will be supported by several developments: public transport, urbanization, and advances in alternative mobility solutions. In future, many people will prefer electric buses or light rail to personal cars. Second, governments are increasingly investing in public transport to ease traffic congestion and to meet the rising demand for public transport. Third, urbanization is changing our view of mobility. More and more people are moving to cities, where the density of the population is high and the need for personal cars is low. Furthermore, technological advances, such as self-driving cars and shared mobility, further support the decline of personal car ownership. In addition, residents in cities emphasize convenience and sustainability, making it less necessary to own a car. In conclusion, improvements in public transport, urbanization and technological advances all suggest that in the next twenty years car use will decline. The shift towards more sustainable and efficient mobility is inevitable for a sustainable future.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.; According to the statement, it is possible for students to pass the examination without attending classes. However, I firmly disagree with this statement for the following reasons: Attending classes deepens the understanding of the subject. Although examinations are meant to test the students ability to memorize and apply the material, they cannot capture the depth of discussion and interactivity that go on in class. Students learn how to express themselves clearly, work well with others, and manage their time effectively when they attend classes. Attending classes cultivates life skills. University is not only about academic knowledge but also personal and professional development. Attending classes also instills consistency and discipline. In a world where distractions are endless, students can build a routine that enhances their productivity and focus. These skills are important for success in the workplace where collaboration and effective communication are paramount. As an added benefit, attending classes provides opportunities for social interaction. Attending classes gives students a chance to meet professors and classmates, which can lead to friendships and business relationships outside the classroom. These relationships can be invaluable for a student seeking internships, jobs, and recommendations. In conclusion, although passing the examination is an important part of academic success, it should not be the only focus of university. Attending classes deepens the learning experience, fosters personal and professional development, and cultivates valuable skills, making it an essential part of university life.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;" I have a partial disagreement with this view. The achievements of hard work are inevitably the achievements of hard work; but the achievement of hard work is often incomparably influenced by the influence of luck, which is incomparable and incomparable. Therefore, the great achievements of the successful entrepreneur, the successful athlete and the successful artist can only be attributed to the continuous hard work of the artist. The fundamental prerequisite for success is to have the desire and ability to achieve the goal, the ability to strive, and the ability to struggle. The premise of success is that there is some passion and willingness to persevere; however, it is not accurate to say that luck has nothing to do with success. ""Hard work can beat talent when talent doesn't work hard,"" this statement fully embodies the effort of the pioneers. This spirit not only sharpens their own skills, but also makes them feel the joy of striving, and it also makes them not be easily defeated. But if we look at the same things, we can also see that luck and hard work are complementary. A talented musician practices a lot, but he has a meeting with an influential person. Besides, his family and society may be conducive to his work or may be inconvenient, and this is also a manifestation of luck. The relationship between effort and luck is different, but both have their own advantages. It is necessary to consider both aspects, which makes people realize the true meaning of success, and also has the consciousness that we can only control our own effort, but also need to accept the unpredictable road of life. In conclusion, although hard work is the foundation of success, luck also has an incomparable role in success, which cannot be ignored."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.; One of the most important benefits of having a teacher is the organized environment that he or she provides. The debate over whether people learn better independently or with a teacher has been going on for a long time. For example, in mathematics, the teacher can present simpler problems that lead to more complex ones, which is often difficult to achieve independently. The teacher can also create a curriculum that meets the needs of all students and breaks down complex subjects into small parts. This ensures that all students understand the most important elements of a lesson before they continue. When you learn independently, it is often difficult to see your mistakes and misunderstandings from an outside point of view. A teacher can help you recognize your mistakes and help you focus on the places where you need to improve. Teachers also provide immediate feedback and individual guidance. He or she can also inspire and motivate the students, with a great passion for the subject, which motivates them to learn the material thoroughly. This immediate feedback and guidance leads to a more effective learning process, which is particularly important for subjects that require practice, such as writing or languages. A teacher provides a learning experience that is much more enjoyable and effective. Although independent learning develops self-discipline and higher thinking skills, it is better to have a teacher. He or she can also explain the practical applications of the subject and relate it to the experience of life, which makes the learning process much richer. It is therefore essential for the formation of knowledgeable and motivated students.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.; I agree with the statement. The most important advantage of working at home is the flexibility it provides. The debate between working at home and working in an office has become extremely relevant in recent years with the emergence of technology for remote work and the changing nature of work. In contrast, working at a companys office usually means that people have to adhere to the fixed working hours, which can be very inconvenient for people with varying commitments. Home-based workers can often set their own hours, enabling them to work during peak hours, and this can increase job satisfaction and help to create a better work-life balance. In addition, people can save money and time on travel costs, which they can use for other purposes, such as family time or personal development. The cost of running an office is also reduced, and this is beneficial for both employers and employees. However, the disadvantages of working from home must also be considered, such as loneliness and communication difficulties. Moreover, working from home is more inclusive, as people with disabilities or difficulties in commuting can also benefit from the arrangement. Finally, although there are benefits to both working from home and working in an office, the benefits of greater flexibility, cost savings and improved inclusivity are more relevant in the changing world of work. However, these disadvantages can be overcome by using the latest technology and maintaining close contact with co-workers.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.; To succeed, you have to become like everyone else. While there are benefits to copying successful behavior and acquiring qualities that everyone likes, I firmly reject the idea that one should be similar to everyone else in order to succeed. First of all, a lot of successful people in history have been successful by being different from others. These people show that it is possible to succeed by being different. Steve Jobs, Vincent van Gogh and other people from different fields of activity, with their originality, created and contributed to innovations in their industry, and unique art that has a lasting effect on society. Their individuality, moreover, inspires creativity and innovation. When people feel free to be themselves, they come up with their own original ideas and, being free to express themselves, they give their unique view of the world, which is necessary for the development of modern world. When people try to be like everyone else, they often end up in careers and lives that do not suit them. In industries such as technology, science, and art, the diversity of teams outperforms the homogeneity of the other, because it has more different ideas and innovations. Finally, people, being themselves, are more satisfied with their lives. This individuality not only inspires creativity and innovation, but also gives a real and true life. Besides, this incongruity can also affect their success, because real motivation is often born when people are following their own interests and strengths. Finally, our incongruity is often the only thing that can make us succeed.
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.; For me, this statement is absolutely correct. Art and music teach children the creative ability to be useful in the future, and in the face of the rapid changes that are happening in our educational system, it is essential to have a discussion about the role of art and music in primary education. That is even more important in a world where automation and technology are increasingly affecting many fields of human activity. Creativity is not only applicable to the art, it also applies to the solution of problems and innovation in many fields. Art and music, in the process of education, in a healthy way, help to cope with emotions, and even develop emotional intelligence. Besides, art and music can significantly contribute to the emotional development of children, since it gives children the opportunity to express their own emotions and learn to put it into words. And it also increases the cognitive ability of children. Art and music improve memory, concentration and critical thinking. For children who find themselves more difficult in other subjects, creative activities will help them to feel good about themselves. The success of learning a musical instrument, for example, is not only beneficial to the child's ability to learn music, but also to the success of learning math, language, science and history. Art and music not only develop children's creative abilities, but also give them the opportunity to succeed in other areas. In the future, people with strong creativity and a well-rounded education will be able to achieve great success in innovation and collaboration.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.; There are many differences between the challenges faced by young people today and those faced by previous generations. First, the rapid development of technology is the most important cause of the current young generation's problems. Furthermore, the labor market has changed a lot. Compared with their parents and grandparents, who were mainly affected by face-to-face communication and simpler technological conditions, the young people of today face the difficulties of digital communication, the pressure of virtual reality, and the influence of unlimited information at their fingertips. The dangers and worries about their career and finances have thus been exacerbated to a level that the previous generation may not have fully understood. Moreover, compared with previous generations, the level of student debt is higher than ever, and the future employment market requires a wide range of skills. In addition, the current environment, such as the climate change and the socio-political crisis, is also different from the past, and the scale of the threat is great. Civil rights movements and world wars were of course also challenging to previous generations, but the scale and immediacy of the current ecological and economic threats have led to a new generation of young people being influenced by this world and feeling a lack of agency. In summary, although young people and their parents and grandparents face similar challenges, the actual difficulties they encounter are of a different nature. The distinctive features of the world's current international environment also make this a unique challenge for young people today.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.; In my opinion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have a deep knowledge of a single subject. In our world, which is changing rapidly, the debate between broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialization in a single subject has become more relevant. For example, consider the field of environmentalism, which requires the study of biology, chemistry, economics and politics. A student who has a broader view of the field of environmentalism can find better solutions to complex problems than someone who specializes in just one field. It is also important to draw parallels between different subjects, because it is often possible to see new solutions that a specialist does not see. And for example, a specialist in technology, besides knowing how to program, should know the basics of business and communication, and even the principles of design. Secondly, a broader academic knowledge makes it easier to compete in the labor market, because the world of work is changing and jobs are often requiring more skills that span different academic fields. A broad education makes it easier to change jobs and industries, and it is also easier to compete in a changing world. Thirdly, a broader academic knowledge makes it easier to empathize with others and be aware of different cultures. In short, specialization can lead to expertise, but a broad education is more beneficial, because it stimulates innovation, increases adaptability and promotes understanding between different cultures. This is especially important in our increasingly interconnected and interdependent world, where the ability to communicate and work effectively with people from different backgrounds is an important part of success. But at the same time, specialization is more important for a career.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.; I strongly agree that successful people are those who are willing to try new things and take risks, rather than only sticking to what they know. Not only do they benefit from learning from experience, but they also develop their ability to adapt to new situations and show resilience, which are essential to a successful life and career. I will illustrate my point with an example. Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, consciously explored new ways of thinking and designing, which led to the invention of revolutionary products such as the iPad and the iPhone. He was willing to explore new areas, which eventually led to the invention of the products that have changed millions of lives. He showed great courage and was not afraid to take risks, as is required to achieve success. Without this courage and foresight, he would have limited the potential of the company and would have made far less important contributions to technology.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.; In today's increasingly connected world, it is common for people to see good social skills as important for their success at work. In the first place, most jobs involve teamwork and teamwork. While academic knowledge is undoubtedly an important foundation for future success, I argue that good social skills are equally, if not more, important for success in the workplace. For example, in the field of marketing and medicine, the job requires constant interaction with many different parties, including patients, colleagues and suppliers. The ability to communicate effectively and deal with social relations can help improve teamwork and project success. Often, companies look for people who are able to deal with various social and political situations and keep the team cohesive and moving forward. Finally, the importance of network building should not be underestimated, and strong social skills can lead to opportunities for a mentor and career development. Besides, someone who only excels academically, but does not know how to get along with people, will find it difficult to make a significant contribution in such a team. Finally, the development of emotional intelligence, an important aspect of inter-personal skills, can help people manage their own emotions and understand the emotions of others. It is often the case that people who are able to work well with others at these events and conferences will benefit from new job offers and other career opportunities that people with more academic knowledge miss. In conclusion, while academic knowledge is important, the ability to relate well to people is even more important for success in the workplace. Getting along well is essential for conflict resolution, persuasion and building a supportive and harmonious culture. These skills will not only increase personal success, but will also create stronger teams and wider networks, leading to a more successful and satisfying career.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.; I believe that while the advertising has some influence on unhealthy eating habits, it is not the main cause. The advertising plays a major role in shaping the behavior of consumers and undoubtedly influences the eating habits of people. However, to assert that it is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits, it ignores a lot of other causes. In the first place, advertisements for sugary foods, fast foods, and convenience foods are often aimed at vulnerable groups, such as children and adolescents, and these advertisements often present unhealthy eating habits as enjoyable and exciting. Children are particularly susceptible to this kind of propaganda, and they are not surprised to develop a taste for unhealthy foods. Furthermore, lifestyle factors also contribute significantly to eating habits. On the one hand, parents and guardians play a crucial role in influencing their children's eating habits, and by offering them healthy choices and teaching them about nutrition, they can help counteract the lure of unhealthy advertisements. On the other hand, psychological and emotional factors that affect eating habits, such as stress and overeating, which are exploited by the advertising industry, are also important. In addition, the accelerated pace of modern life often means that people have little time to cook healthy food. The economic difficulties they face often make fast food more convenient than healthy food. Therefore, it is not enough to criticize advertising, but also to establish a supportive environment for healthy food. In conclusion, although the advertising influences the unhealthy eating habits of consumers through its persuasive and pervasive messages, it is only one of the many factors.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television."; An essay on this subject is an important topic for debate. While it is true that people are distracted and isolated, I believe that communication has not been destroyed, but transformed in a way that is both beneficial and unfavorable. First, communication is provided through shared experiences. A family, for example, can gather to watch a popular series, which can lead to a discussion of character development and plot, and thus strengthen communication. In this sense, the public is the medium of stronger relationships. When watching films and series, people often chat and make friends with each other. Second, the news and documentaries inform us of the events of the world and different cultures and therefore create opportunities for conversation. Third, it can inspire conversations that further improve relationships. Having seen a documentary on climate change, a family can then engage in a meaningful discussion about the environment, and communication has improved. However, it is undoubtedly true that people who spend too much time watching the program will lose touch with their loved ones. So the final influence of the public depends on the choices and family atmosphere. In this sense, it is important to recognize that the challenge is not in the public itself, but in the way people use it.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.; As I see it, sports and social activities in universities and colleges are important in many ways. Firstly, through the game, students develop essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline and leadership. As a result, they learn how to work effectively with others, which is a highly valued skill in the workplace. Moreover, the physical benefits of sports can also improve students' overall health, which is very important for their academic performance. Also, social activities are an important way for students to get to know each other, as college life is often a pivotal time for young people, and social interaction can contribute significantly to their personal development. It has been scientifically proven that regular physical exercise can help improve concentration, reduce stress and stimulate brain function, all of which can contribute to academic success. Universities that promote a well-rounded education, by promoting academics and extracurricular activities, will produce well-rounded people. Social activities in the form of clubs, associations and recreational activities will promote diversity and diversity among students and, as a result, facilitate the establishment of lifelong friendships and professional networks after graduation. Sports and social activities are important parts of the university experience and play an important role in the development of not only the mind, but also the body and social skills of students. As a result, they should be given the same financial support as academics to ensure that the learning environment is balanced and enriched.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.; The argument for and against studying hard at school and relating well to people is complex. Although both aspects are undeniably important, the ability to relate well to people is becoming increasingly important in today's professional environment. According to research, employers are now putting people with good communication and social skills ahead of those who excel in their studies but have little contact with people. In the world of work, where diverse individuals must work together to achieve common goals, the ability to communicate well and relate well to others is paramount. Moreover, career advancement is possible only with a strong network of colleagues, mentors, and industry professionals, who can lead to job offers, promotion opportunities, or new collaborations. The application of specialized knowledge and skills acquired through academic work, for example in the field of medicine, engineering, or science, requires the successful and effective implementation of knowledge. However, it is also important to recognize that academic knowledge provides the basis for many professions. As the world of work continues to evolve and become more social and more interconnected, soft skills will take precedence over academic achievements. Therefore, the development of strong social skills should be a priority for future professionals. In conclusion, while academic achievement can open the door to career opportunities, the ability to relate well to people is the key to long-term success.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.; To answer this question I will answer in favor. First of all, the amount of information young people receive today is very much overwhelming. Secondly, the modern world is constantly changing and young people need to be able to plan and organize for a lifetime. Thirdly, the ability to plan and organize is an essential skill for the young people of today. Because they have to deal with the Internet, social media and all the digital tools that they have, they have to set priorities and set aside time. This not only increases productivity, but also gives a sense of achievement and improves self-esteem. Moreover, the demands of school, both academic and extra-curricular, must be managed by students. In addition, as the world becomes more complex, employers are increasingly looking for employees who can plan and organize, work in a team and be flexible. Therefore, young people with these skills will stand out and will be able to follow their career more easily. To conclude, as life becomes more complex and interdependent, the ability to plan and organize is not only beneficial, but also essential for young people. The complexity of global issues such as climate change, social inequality and economic insecurity requires the leadership of young people who can think strategically and find organized solutions. By encouraging these skills, we enable young people to be active agents of change. They need to be able to manage their time and space in order to cope with the challenges of their lives and the challenges of the future.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.; This essay will discuss whether university students should be required to attend classes or not. Firstly, the classes create a learning environment. Students have to attend classes to study hard and not to be distracted from their work. In addition, attending classes helps students manage their time and make time for studies. Professors clarify complex topics, answer the student's specific questions and encourage class discussions. In addition, there is a close contact between the students and the professors and this relationship is very beneficial for students' learning. Classes also include a lot of activities, demonstrations and group projects that are not available to students studying on their own or studying on the Internet. Meeting with classmates and collaborating with each other helps develop critical thinking and helps in preparing for the future career. While some argue that going to class should be left to the student's free will and responsibility, it can lead to a lack of commitment and learning. During the university years, it is especially important to develop habits of accountability and teamwork. It is also important for students to be able to do practical work, as in science, technology and art, to get hands-on experience. For all these reasons, I believe that university students should be required to attend classes. To sum up, mandatory attendance not only creates a structured and exciting educational environment, but also promotes personal interaction and contributes to the general learning experience.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;" The main reasons are the following: “The use of telephones and emails has made communication less personal and richer in many ways.” First, telephones and emails are by their very nature impersonal; for example, when you apologize to someone in person, you can see the other person’s facial expression and your gestures and this is a more intimate connection. The speed of email and texting has also led to the culture of fast communication, which has a certain superficiality, lack of depth and sometimes a sense of misunderstanding. In contrast, a phone call or an email is often misunderstood and sometimes lacks the intimacy that a face-to-face conversation would have. Also, the ubiquity of technology can make people feel connected, while making them feel disconnected. For example, a group of friends might exchange emails every day, but they miss the opportunity for a deeper, more meaningful conversation. I think that, although it is easier to get in touch with many people, this kind of impersonal, impersonal and superficial connection means that the quality of the communication is reduced. In conclusion, although telephones and emails are useful tools for communicating with others, they can make personal communication less meaningful. In my opinion, the richness and emotional depth of communication that a person can experience in a face-to-face conversation or in a handwritten letter is unmatched and demonstrates the importance of balancing convenience with the essence of personal communication."
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.; I would prefer to live in a small town. The quietness and community spirit are exactly what I like most about small towns. In small towns, one can enjoy the beauty of nature and open space, such as parks, small farms and scenic trails. A pleasant walk on a quiet street with trees lining the sidewalks and children playing in the yard is very different from the city life. The pace of life is slower and more relaxed. A sense of community is also a very important feature of small towns. In a small town, neighbors know each other, and there is a greater sense of support and community among them. Such an environment makes people feel more peaceful and connected to their environment. Small towns are more likely to have a local fair, a community celebration, and other events that can make people get to know each other. Unlike the cities where people can feel isolated in the middle of a crowd, small towns have a strong sense of community that can develop into friendships. Moreover, small towns are more cost-effective, which makes it easier for people to live there. In conclusion, although the city offers a wider variety of activities and more cultural experiences, I prefer to live in a small town. The cost of living is lower, and it is much easier to own a house and live comfortably than in the city. People who are more interested in financial security and peace of mind can find a more suitable place in a small town. Compared with the city, small towns are more in line with my personal value system.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.; Personally, I prefer new challenges and calculated risks, not only because of the desire to develop myself, but also because of the excitement of discovering hidden potential. In the ever-changing landscape of personal and professional development, the choice between the old and the new usually determines the direction of our future development. For example, when I started to learn to play the guitar, I initially had difficulties with chords and rhythms, but as I learned, I was rewarded by the joy of success, and each small success gave me the courage to try new songs and new styles, which in turn increased my musical ability and broadened my artistic vision. And new achievements also lead to higher self-esteem. Moreover, the pursuit of new opportunities has enhanced my ability to adapt to new conditions, a necessary trait in today's changing world. And the experience of playing the guitar has taught me that when you put yourself out of your comfort zone, you will discover a whole new set of skills and abilities. During my internship, I was asked to complete a project that required data analysis, a field in which I had no previous experience. But I did not shy away from the task, instead I consulted my colleagues and the Internet to acquire the necessary knowledge, which not only satisfied my supervisor's requirements but also helped me to understand the importance of data analysis in business decisions. That is, in a fast-changing world, the ability to learn and adapt is essential to our personal growth and our success in business. On the other hand, sticking to what one can do well may lead to mastery of a particular skill, but it may also restrict the experience of the new. Consequently, my preference for new challenges and calculated risks is an important step in my development towards becoming a more flexible and adaptable individual.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.; I am very much in favor of this statement. It is extremely important for children to learn about financial responsibility at an early age. It is especially important today, when the financial system has become more complex and there are so many more of us to teach, to teach children the skills they need to manage their money in the future. Children can, for example, allocate part of their pocket money for various purposes, such as saving for a large purchase or donating to a charity, and with this practical experience they can be educated to understand the financial consequences of their decisions before they become adults. By learning the basics of budgeting, saving and wise spending, children are taught to distinguish between needs and wants. When a child saves for a new toy or a trip, he learns how to manage the gratification he has for that goal, and when he succeeds, he feels happy and proud of himself. Moreover, learning about money management early in life teaches children to set and achieve goals. To sum up, it is important for children to learn to manage their own money in order to become financially responsible adults. Moreover, the earlier the child is introduced to these concepts, the more likely it is that they will be followed by the child in adulthood. Not only is such education beneficial for children, but it is also necessary for the cultivation of a responsible and economically able society. If children learn to manage their money, they will have the tools they need to make good decisions, achieve their goals and build a secure future.
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.; I strongly agree with the statement that dancing is an important part of cultural heritage. Firstly, dance is an ancient art that reaches beyond language. Dancing is undeniably a vital part of every culture, serving as a way to express and communicate feelings and emotions, and to bring people together in the midst of social tension. For example, traditional dances tell stories and celebrate important moments in the life of a community, and preserve historical knowledge that can be passed on to later generations. Hula dance from Hawai for example, through the use of storytelling and music, expresses the beliefs and spiritual beliefs of the Hawaiians. It allows the storyteller to express emotions and share stories that would be difficult to convey with words. Moreover, dance brings people together in festivals, celebrations and religious celebrations, strengthening community cohesion and allowing people to express shared values and identities. Finally, dancing makes us feel like we are part of a community. In an increasingly globalized world, dance is a way to preserve cultural identity. In societies where dance is an important part of the culture, such as samba in Brazil, dances are the focus of cultural pride and unite people from different ethnic groups. These dances connect the people with their roots and inspire the younger generation to carry on the tradition so that the dance is not lost in time. For example, Pow Wow dances of the Indians celebrate the culture of the Indians and show that the dance tradition is alive and that it has not been lost. Dancing thus plays an invaluable role in the enrichment and sustenance of cultures all over the world.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.; I completely agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This is more important than ever in a world where changes are occurring at an ever faster rate, where complex problems must be solved, where critical thinking and creativity are increasingly demanded. Students must be able to understand the underlying principles of a subject, so that they can apply this knowledge to real-world situations. If a student understands the concept of gravity, he can recognize its significance for the physics and astronomy subject. A deep understanding of concepts leads to a greater understanding of the subject matter and the opportunity to make connections between subjects. Students who are interested in ideas can ask questions, analyze situations and develop their own opinions. In an age where knowledge is abundant, but the application of this knowledge is not, the ability to apply this knowledge is more important than ever. Moreover, in the digital age, access to information has become easier. This develops an attitude of curiosity and the ability to solve problems, which is so important in overcoming the challenges of everyday life. In conclusion, the understanding of ideas and concepts is the foundation of a meaningful education, critical thinking and the ability to adapt to an ever-changing world. With a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips, it is less useful for students to memorize information, but it is more important for them to understand the underlying principles of a subject, so that they can develop a lifelong love of learning. In this way, the concepts must be the mainstay of the learning process, and the teaching of ideas and concepts rather than mere memorization is more relevant to the education of the future.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.; Sports and social activities are very important in promoting physical health and well-being among students. Even though the main purpose of universities and colleges is to develop the knowledge and intelligence of students, I agree with the statement that universities and colleges must allocate equal financial support to sports and social activities. In team sports, for example, students can learn teamwork, discipline and leadership, which are useful in the future job market. Students are under pressure to complete difficult academic work, which can lead to great tension. Participating in sports can not only relieve the pressure but also give a sense of belonging and togetherness. Moreover, social activities can enhance the learning experience and provide opportunities for personal development and socialization. The cultural festivals, courses and clubs on campus can develop the diverse interests and interests of the students, so they can cultivate a wide range of social skills. Also, a university environment that includes social activities and sports is more diversified and less rigid. In the extra-academic societies and clubs, for example, students often build their professional connections, which are very useful for job hunting after graduation. Also, students from different backgrounds and nationalities can communicate, work together and get to know each other. Therefore, students can develop better, and the academic environment can also be enriched. In my opinion, equal financial support for social activities and sports not only helps students develop their physical and social skills, but also helps them to learn in different aspects and be more adaptable to an increasingly complex society.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.; On one side, many people claim that the Internet provides people with knowledge on almost any subject, and that such access has a positive effect on education and learning. There is no doubt that the Internet has transformed the way we access and share information. On the other hand, it can be argued that access to such a vast amount of information can be problematic. On the one hand, there are numerous resources available to anyone with access to the Internet: educational articles, online courses and digital libraries. However, it can be argued that the sheer amount of information available can cause confusion and misinformation, since not all the material available is reliable or accurate. This problem is made worse by the spread of misinformation in critical situations such as elections or outbreaks of diseases, when people are misled by unreliable sources and their opinions and actions are misguided. One way to counter this is for users to develop the critical thinking skills needed to be able to verify and evaluate the information they read. In my opinion, although the Internet provides a wealth of information, the Internet also requires users to exercise caution and discernment. It is necessary to teach future generations to be able to recognize the validity of sources and to apply the skills they learn in this way. This would enable us to reap the benefits of the Internet’s knowledge and to ensure that its benefits are fully reaped. In conclusion, the Internet is a powerful source of knowledge that has the potential to improve our understanding of the world around us.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.; The first approach gives students a broad range of skills and knowledge. The second approach gives students more specialized skills and knowledge. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice may depend on the student's circumstances and ambitions. One approach that seems to have some advantages is the approach that encourages students to explore various subjects, including humanities, social sciences, and the arts. This encourages critical thinking and creativity and can also help students to face the increasing complexity of the world. One reason for this is that it allows students to study a variety of subjects. In contrast, specialization can be useful for students who are planning a particular career, especially in the fields of medicine, engineering and law, where specialized knowledge is very important. However, it is difficult to answer which is the best approach because it depends on a student's career plans and ambitions. A student who immerses himself in the technology will learn more advanced concepts and have better preparation for practical applications. A well-balanced approach that combines the best of both approaches may also be appropriate. This allows students to develop basic skills in different areas, while also being able to immerse themselves in specialization.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.; It is undeniable that the exploration of space is exciting, but the money governments spend on this should be spent on basic needs on Earth. The debate between government spending on space exploration and spending on our basic needs on Earth is a complex and important issue. For example, the billions of dollars spent on the exploration of the Moon and Mars could help to end poverty, support health care or invest in the production of clean energy to combat climate change. There are millions of people around the world who lack food, water, health care and education, but they are diverted from these important issues. These developments would benefit us immediately and would help to make our society healthier. It is undeniable that space research has led to many technological developments, but many of these developments could be developed together with the solutions to problems on Earth. Moreover, a focus on our planet would allow us to develop more sustainably. It is important to recognize that the well-being of the people on our planet and the environment should take priority over exploring space. Although space research has led to global cooperation and scientific advances, the welfare of the people on our planet should take priority over space travel. Moreover, the development of sustainable technology could help to ensure that the Earth is viable for future generations. And so governments should focus their resources on solving the problems on our planet before venturing into the unknown space. Finally, by investing in urgent needs on Earth, we not only ensure our immediate survival, but also ensure a sustainable future for all human beings.
281;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples in your answer. ;Nowadays, we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated. Everything seem to be rush, and it have a lot of competition. These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable. And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.; I think the most beneficial ways to relieve stress are exercise, reading, and practicing mindfulness. In the fast-paced world of today, stress has become a common problem for many people. People who find ways to reduce stress are more likely to feel mentally healthy. A good way to relieve stress is to do exercise. When you do running, swimming, or even just walking, you can relieve your mental pressure and feel refreshed. Exercise also produces endorphins, a brain chemical that elevates mood and improves the feeling of happiness. A recent study at the Mayo Clinic has found that moderate exercise can significantly reduce anxiety and improve mood, confirming the old saying that “a healthy body keeps a healthy mind”. Secondly, reading can also be a good way to relieve the pressures of everyday life. One example is the e-book that was developed to help people cope with loneliness and uncertainty during the COVID19 pandemic. Reading literature can offer readers the hope, comfort, and even the joy of laughter. Reading literature makes you temporarily forget about your troubles and go to another world. The use of deep breathing and meditation techniques can also relieve stress. Finally, the practice of mindfulness is becoming more and more popular in recent years as a way to relieve stress. Mindfulness has become a fashionable word in recent years, and people who do it in different ways have different experiences, but they can all relieve mental tension and restore balance. In conclusion, although there are many ways to escape the pressures of modern life, I think that exercise, reading, and meditation are the most effective ways to relieve stress. Research from Harvard University shows that meditation can change the brain and help with the control of emotions and the ability to cope with difficulties. Therefore, if we do these things as a part of our daily lives, we can cope better with the stress in today's world.
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.; In theory, it seems reasonable to pay teachers according to student achievements. However, I disagree with this idea, because it is difficult to measure the achievements of teachers. If a teacher works in a poor school with a lack of resources, he or she may face many obstacles that may prevent the student from learning effectively, despite the quality of the teacher's work. In this case, the teacher may be discouraged and it is possible that talented people will not want to become teachers. Some students are more interested in critical thinking and are less interested in mathematics. They are less likely to succeed in standardized tests, so their teachers should not be paid. Finally, teaching is a teamwork between teachers, parents and the community. This means that the narrow focus on individual metrics can lead to a reduction in the curriculum, and teachers will focus on test preparation, which will reduce creativity and critical thinking, and encourage only rote learning. To conclude, although the idea of paying teachers according to their students' achievements is a reasonable one, it is not fair and it simplifies the learning process. To make teachers solely responsible for the achievement of their students ignores the role of others and oversimplifies the learning process.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.; I fully agree with the above statement for several reasons. Firstly, media are a powerful tool to shape society’s values and attitudes. Therefore, it is extremely important for them to show the true value of good and bad people in a clear, understandable manner. The result of such an exposure will be especially useful for young people, who are still learning about integrity, compassion and responsibility. Second, a good ending to the story can bring hope and happiness to the audience. The triumph of good over evil inspires people to live righteously, and the characters who win the victory are the ones who are righteous. On the other hand, some people might argue that the reality of life is not as clear-cut as in fiction and the bad often have a good time while the good are punished. This is true, but we should not forget that the entertainment industry is often a way to escape from the harsh realities of life. Besides, the emphasis on justice in the story is not only a way to educate the audience, but also to give the audience a satisfying ending. In conclusion, I think that films and TV shows should present the stories in which the good are rewarded and the bad are punished.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.; People who want this change argue that this shift will make learning more accessible, more individualized and more effective. In the last few years, education has changed drastically as a result of the rapid development of technology. Distance learning and online courses have become a viable alternative to classroom learning. In many ways, this has made education more accessible. Distance learning and learning on the Internet are available to all, regardless of geographical location. It allows people who have difficulties with transport, financial or health problems to participate in learning opportunities that were once beyond their reach. Also, there is a degree of individualization that is lacking in many classrooms. In the classroom, learning is often carried out at the same pace, regardless of individual differences. In the virtual classroom, everyone learns at his own pace and on his own schedule. This encourages students to learn not only the content, but also to learn critical skills such as time management and self-discipline. However, critics point out that social interaction in the classroom is important for personal development. These are both valid points. However, as new technology continues to be developed, it is important to carefully consider the possibilities, and to ensure that they do not completely replace the human interaction that is an essential part of the learning experience. In conclusion, distance learning and learning on the Internet offer a modern solution that can enhance the education system by making learning more accessible and individualized.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.; One of the most significant moments in my life was during my volunteer work at a local homeless shelter. The interaction with the homeless showed me the complexity of issues I had previously considered from a distance. One experience that was particularly influential for me was my family’s move to a new city when I was a teen. It taught me empathy and the importance of the human connection. It also encouraged me to be grateful for what I had and to work towards improving the community. It was difficult at first, leaving friends and a comfortable environment, but it made me more adaptable and open-minded. My educational journey has also been important. It has challenged me to think critically about the ideas and beliefs that I take for granted. It has also given me a curiosity about the world and a desire to learn more about different perspectives. Finally, my experiences have shaped me as a person, showing me the value of empathy, adaptability, and critical thinking. They have pushed me to live with purpose, to learn about the world, and to advocate for positive change. These lessons have shaped my interactions with others and influenced my sense of self. They have shown me the value of compassion and understanding.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.; In the United States of America, foreign languages are taught in schools and universities in the home country and in the country where the language is spoken. Both methods have advantages for certain people, but also disadvantages. In the home country there is a greater variety of schools, and more courses, books and study groups are available. The learning environment is more controlled and, as a rule, better qualified teachers are available to help people with special difficulties. In the home country a person can learn the grammar and vocabulary without the pressure of being surrounded by the language, but the opportunity to observe the language in its everyday use and the cultural environment is less. On the other hand, in the country where the language is spoken, there are daily opportunities to practice, which quickly increases fluency and comprehension. It also gives opportunities to pick up idioms, slang, and special cultural references which are difficult to understand from the text books. The greatest advantage of all, however, is the possibility of dealing effectively with native speakers, and experiencing the language in everyday life. In my opinion, both methods have value, but the greatest advantages are learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken, with the opportunity of using it and understanding it in its cultural context. Using this more comprehensive method leads to greater fluency and a closer cultural understanding.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.; I would like to change the public transport in my hometown. Although my hometown has a beautiful small town and a tight community, it is too dependent on private vehicles, and has some difficulties in traffic congestion, air pollution and lack of access to some essential services. First, by improving public transport, it is possible to ease traffic congestion. During the rush hour, a lot of cars will arrive at work or school. Since they all rely on cars, there are many traffic jams on the road, and they have a hard time getting to work. In addition, traffic jams are bad for the environment. The road is very congested, and air pollution has become a problem. If public transport is improved, more people will leave their cars at home, which will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air and make people feel comfortable. Secondly, public transport can help the poor and the elderly who have no private cars to easily access medical care and educational institutions. For example, cities such as Amsterdam and Tokyo have invested heavily in public transport, and the air quality has improved dramatically. To sum up, improving public transport can not only alleviate traffic congestion and improve the environment, but also make the lives of residents better. Because of a lack of public transport, many people are unable to find work, which will also create a cycle of poverty.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.; I believe that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers. Some people think that this would improve teaching methods. I believe that students should be encouraged to express their opinions about their teachers. Firstly, the teachers will be able to learn about their own teaching. Students, as the main audience, have a unique insight into the teachers' teaching methods and whether the teachers communicate their subjects well. If they often seem to be confusing, or their teaching methods are not so attractive to students, then they will make the necessary changes. Students will also be able to see where teachers need to improve, and teachers can make the necessary changes. In addition, by allowing students to evaluate teachers, the culture of openness and accountability will also be developed, and everyone will accept and welcome criticism, which is very helpful for personal and professional growth. When students know how to express their opinions about their teachers, they will be able to learn the importance of critical thinking and evaluation skills, which are also useful for their future work. Students are also able to take responsibility for their education. Besides, it is important that the evaluation is done carefully and correctly, and I think that student feedback is an important factor in the pursuit of excellence. In short, by introducing a system of evaluating teachers, it can improve the quality of teaching and make students feel stronger.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.; I prefer to work for a small company. Although both have their own advantages, my personal preference lies with a small company because it offers more opportunities for personal development, a closer community, and more opportunities for significant influence. In a smaller company, employees have the opportunity to work on projects from different departments, so they have a wider set of skills that they can develop. This is an invaluable experience for personal development. Because there are fewer employees, the cohesion and support among colleagues are also greater. This not only enriches the ability of employees but also makes the experience richer and more meaningful. Moreover, the flat organization structure is common in smaller companies, which can facilitate the exchange of ideas and the creation of new solutions. This is also conducive to a happier and more valued work environment. In short, the advantages of a small company, from personal development to the community and influence, all meet my personal and professional needs. In a large company, I can easily be a machine without meaning. But in a small company, my contribution to the company's success can be significant, which will increase my motivation and satisfaction and make my work more meaningful. All in all, for me, small companies are the most appropriate environment for career development and success.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.; They argue that education is a fundamental right. They say that higher education serves not only to provide knowledge to individuals, but also to build a more educated society. And they also argue that it is important for all students to have the opportunity to continue their education, especially in a rapidly changing job market where many jobs require higher skills. In addition, they argue that it is important for society to maintain a high level of knowledge and to ensure that funds are well spent. In my opinion, both views have their advantages and disadvantages, but I think the ones who think that higher education should be available to all students are right. They argue that the high academic achievements of students are the results of hard work and that this kind of work should be rewarded. But instead of limiting education, they think that high schools should offer better preparation for college and give all students the tools to succeed in college. Higher education, which is accessible to everyone, is an opportunity for the development of society, and the interests of the society outweigh the concern for academic standards. And it also makes it possible to help people throughout their lives.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.; This has been argued in recent years that many people believe that the playing of computer games wastes time and should be restricted to students. This is based on the assumption that excessive game play leads to procrastination, decreased academic performance, and physical and mental problems. Study has shown that students who spend more time playing games get lower grades, because they play games rather than do homework, or do projects or studies for the exam. Above all, it is important to mention the possibility of academic decline that can occur due to the gaming time. Students often find themselves absorbed in virtual worlds, thus ignoring their most important obligations. On the other hand, gaming can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is a health hazard. Many students sit in front of their screens for hours, which affects their physical activity. It will lead to a gradual decline in academic performance, which will eventually affect their ability to pursue further studies. However, the gaming experience can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Also, this isolation can lead to further problems such as obesity, heart disease and bad posture. Nevertheless, it is argued that unregulated access to games can lead to harmful results. Although it is important to realize that not all gaming is bad, it is also important to emphasize moderation. In my opinion, it is reasonable to limit the gaming time for students to ensure that they live a balanced life, which is concerned with their health, well-being and education.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.; To this task, I firmly believe that colleagues and classmates should, if possible, work on projects in person. The advantages of a personal encounter far outweigh the advantages of distance. When classmates and colleagues work together in the same physical space, they are more likely to start spontaneous conversations, discuss and solve problems, which not only enhances teamwork, but also increases personal connections. . First, in-person collaboration strengthens the relationships and establishes a sense of community between the team members. In addition, there is also an instantaneous feedback and clarification when working on a project. When working on a project, there may be misunderstandings and clarifications, and solving them immediately is very important to the progress of the work. . E-mails are convenient and flexible, but sometimes they take time to reply. And emails often lack the non-verbal communication that can help us understand better, which can sometimes happen when we communicate by e-mail. The length of the e-mails can also lead to misunderstandings. In conclusion, both ways of communication are good, but when working on projects, in-person communication is more advantageous. A person-to-person exchange can greatly increase the quality and success of the work of colleagues and classmates, and it is the best way to do so.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.; A balanced approach to the two activities is desirable, but education must take precedence for several reasons. While it is undeniable that academics should conduct cutting-edge research, I think that university professors should place the priority on educating students. Students attend university not only to learn subject-related knowledge, but also to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Professors play a vital role in this, influencing students’ intellectual development and preparing them for the challenges of future careers. Moreover, education is the fundamental goal of educational institutions. In addition, education involves more than imparting knowledge: it is about guiding and encouraging students to develop their potential. The quality of education may suffer if professors devote too much time to research, and there may also be a disjunction between academic theory and its practical application. As important as research is for innovation and contributing to the development of the field, it may result in the neglect of a crucial educational role in fostering the next generation of scholars and leaders. Research, of course, enables academics to make significant contributions to new ideas and thinking. But research can be a valuable tool in improving student performance and motivation, and enriching the academic environment. Nonetheless, it is the professors’ duty to place the greatest emphasis on educating students. In the end, it is clear that the emphasis on education is crucial for developing students’ skills and preparing them for a fast-changing world. While the university should view research and education as complementary, it is the latter that provides the basis for successful research.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.; This is a complex issue that varies greatly between people. Learning independently allows for personal education where the student can explore subjects at his own pace. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and learning by both methods depends on learning styles, which makes a great difference in the quality of learning. Self-study often enables the student to find a personal interest in the subject because the student chooses the subject. The student can also study in a way that best suits his needs, be it through reading, the Internet or practical work. This independence is often accompanied by self-discipline, critical thinking and problem solving skills. Teacher’s often have the ability to help the student to understand, for example, an explanation, clarify a doubt, present difficult concepts in an easy way to understand. However, learning with a teacher provides structure, guidance and feedback. The interactivity of learning with a teacher can also motivate those students who prefer social contact, providing encouragement and accountability that may be missing from individual learning. The social learning that takes place in a classroom is an added advantage, where students can discuss and share perspectives and insights. In the end, learning by oneself or with a teacher is a matter of personal preferences and needs. The best results often come from combining the two, using the individual exploration of self-study with the value of experienced teachers. While some students may find freedom and deepen their own thinking through their own freedom, others may need the support and guidance of an experienced teacher to explore difficult topics.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.; One of the most striking examples of this is the emergence of smart devices. In our fast-paced world, technology is often portrayed as a means of simplifying the daily lives of people and improving their quality of life. These days, however, it is precisely these devices that make life more difficult, for the operating systems and the wide range of applications have become too complicated for people to cope with and there are too many incompatibilities to contend with. Initially, the smart home and smart phone were designed as tools for making our lives simpler and offering a number of controls at our fingertips. In this respect, social media platforms provide an extreme example of this technological paradox, for although they are meant to bring people together, they actually often increase people's sense of loneliness and isolation. In order to control a simple process such as turning on a light, people now need to navigate through various applications, master complicated settings and keep a close eye on the smart devices to make sure that they are working properly. Furthermore, automation, which was meant to make life easier, has actually led to unemployment, increased economic uncertainty and the constant need for people to acquire new skills. Moreover, the digital interplay between people is more complex than it was intended to be and contributes to increased mental health issues. Thus, when integrating these tools into our daily lives, we need to be mindful of the complications that they introduce and learn to benefit from them while avoiding the complications they can create. In short, while technology has the potential to simplify our lives, it often brings its own complications.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons."; What are the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning? In the last few years, as a result of a world-wide event such as the COVID-19 pandemic, distance-learning programs have been gaining popularity. The advantages of distance learning include greater flexibility for working people or people with family responsibilities, so that they can pursue their education without having to relocate or drastically change their schedule. Distance learning also helps to break down the geographical barriers that restrict educational opportunities, as students can take classes from anywhere in the world, regardless of their physical location. Many programs now offer a variety of learning resources such as videos, podcasts, and discussion boards, which accommodate various learning styles and allow students to learn in a way that suits them. In addition, technological developments have greatly improved the quality of distance-learning programs. Nevertheless, distance learning also has its limitations. One of the most obvious limitations is the lack of face-to-face contact, which is essential for the development of communication skills and the establishment of professional networks. In my opinion, a hybrid system combining both distance learning and face-to-face learning would provide the best educational outcomes for students, enabling them to benefit from the advantages of both systems. Furthermore, certain disciplines, especially those that require a great deal of practical experience, may not be well suited to distance learning.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future."; Firstly, working while studying makes young people responsible and responsible for their own time. Although many people argue that this practice is detrimental to their education, I believe that this practice can provide young people with useful life skills and financial benefits. For example, a student working part-time in a department store will learn to organize and schedule tasks, and personal and social responsibilities, which will later prepare him for the demands of further education or work. Secondly, it is very useful to know how to manage their time and manage their tasks, as well as learn to set priorities and plan their lives in general. Students will be able to develop the necessary soft skills, such as communication, teamwork and problem-solving, and will be able to compete better in the job market. Finally, the experience of working while studying will also enrich the resume of the teenagers. Earning money teaches young people to budget, make decisions and save. Such experience will also help them understand their interests and career goals at an early age, so that they can make more rational decisions about their future. Work and school, in my opinion, can be a positive and enriching experience for young people. Finally, although there are certain disadvantages to having a job while studying, such as the impact on schoolwork and a reduction in the time available for other activities, there are also many benefits, such as the ability to pay for tuition and other educational expenses, and the ability to contribute to extracurricular activities, without having to rely on parental support.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.; Learning a foreign language in your own country often offers the advantages of a standardized course and professional teachers who can guide you through the complexities of grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary. However, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages that can affect the language learning process. For example, language schools and community colleges offer many resources to help learners in this process. In addition, learners often have the advantage of culturally adapted materials that can facilitate their comprehension. They have the opportunity to participate in real-world conversations, to pick up on slang and to listen to native speakers. On the other hand, living in the country where the language is spoken offers a unique opportunity for immersion and cultural integration. Learners have the advantage of direct contact with native speakers and a chance to adjust to life in a new country. In my opinion, although learning a language in one's own country is more effective in developing basic language skills, learning a language abroad is more effective in acquiring fluency and cultural understanding. I would say that the benefits of language learning abroad outweigh the costs and the experience is richer and more rewarding.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.; This task has always been a controversial issue, and different opinions have been expressed regarding the best structure of school vacations for students. The benefits of this structure are the enhancement of learning, prevention of burnout and timely opportunities for recreation. As students are exposed to schoolwork without rest, they may get tired and lack enthusiasm, and the short vacations can serve as a mental health break that refreshes the mind, allowing students to focus more on their schoolwork and increase their enthusiasm. Firstly, frequent short breaks prevent students from burning out. Students can plan their studies around the vacations, and there is less pressure on the study schedule. For example, after a busy semester, a week's vacation can be refreshed and improved, so that students are more interested in class when they go back to class. Secondly, short vacations provide more opportunities for family communication. Many families are difficult to arrange a single long vacation. Students can use short vacations to participate in more outdoor activities, learn hobbies and skills, and pursue their own interests, which can also enrich their educational experience. This structure is more suitable for the increasingly diverse needs of students in today's fast-paced school environment. In conclusion, although a long holiday may be tempting, several short vacations can bring more benefits in terms of mental health, educational flexibility and family communication.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";" I completely agree with this statement because it contains an important truth about goals and ambitions. Firstly, persistence is often the only difference between success and failure. Thomas Edison said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. "" Despite numerous failures, he never gave up. The same thing happened to J. K. Rowling, the British writer of the Harry Potter books. Her first novel was rejected twelve times before it was finally accepted by the publishers. Secondly, as a result of such perseverance, great achievements are sometimes achieved. For example, a student who initially finds it difficult to understand a difficult subject may give up, but as a result of his perseverance, he may learn persistence, adaptability and persistence in solving problems. In the process of reaching for a goal, many important life lessons are learned. Also, it is important to note that the expression ""never give up"" does not mean blindly pursuing an unprofitable goal. In the end, these skills and experiences will be invaluable for future success in work and life. In conclusion, the expression ""never give up"" is a powerful reminder that persistence and patience are essential for the realization of dreams. However, it is important to note that this perseverance must be accompanied by the realism of goals and methods. Consequently, a person can achieve his or her goals by adopting this attitude."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.; This is a debate that many people talk about. Using money immediately can give you a good life, while saving money can give you a solid future. I think both arguments have their advantages, but in my opinion the best solution is a balance between them. A person who goes on a trip and experiences something that he will never forget and experiences something that he has never experienced before may have deepened his understanding of the world and culture. On the other hand, using money as soon as you earn it can give you immediate happiness and a satisfying life. Travel, eating out and hobbies are things that can enrich your life. In addition, the use of money has its advantages. According to studies, people who use their money to buy experiences are happier than those who buy things. On the other hand, saving money is also a good thing. Saving money can give you freedom from debt. In addition, people who invest in pensions and other things at an early stage will benefit from the compound interest and later have a very comfortable life. Saving money will give you a secure future. In the end, the benefits of both are undeniable, and the key to enjoying your money and saving money is to find a balance between the two.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.; In my opinion, it is a good thing to live a slow life. Firstly, a slow life makes you feel good. In our fast-paced world, this choice is often a matter of personal preferences and lifestyle choices. For me, by taking my time, I have the opportunity to engage in self-care, practice mindfulness and focus on my favorite activities. For example, I meditate and enjoy long walks in nature. Secondly, a slow life will make you healthy. When I talk to people and do things, I can feel completely immersed in the moment. This balance makes me feel calm and healthy, and rushing life is not conducive to these things. Thirdly, a slow life will make you appreciate life. For example, I love to spend the weekend with my family, play games, share stories and eat without the pressure of a ticking clock. So, while some people thrive on the fast pace of modern life, I have come to appreciate the slow pace of life. I notice the beauty in the sunset, the laughter of my friends, and the aroma of the food being cooked, and this feeling of gratitude makes each moment meaningful. When I think about my priorities, I think that I have more time to be grateful, build meaningful relationships, and appreciate the beauty of life.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.; ... There are many sides to this question. Although it is undeniable that human development is essential for social progress and economic prosperity, I would argue that the preservation of endangered animals' homes is equally important and should not be sacrificed for the needs of human expansion. Firstly, the existence of many different species is essential for the stability of the ecosystem. The existence of bees and other pollinators is essential for the survival of agriculture, so it is not surprising that the maintenance of land for these animals not only protects them, but indirectly benefits our food sources. Moreover, the loss of diversity will result in a decline in the quality of life for future generations. Secondly, the loss of biodiversity will have a negative impact on future generations. Besides, the preservation of endangered animals can bring local economies in the form of tourism and recreation. The model of development that focuses on development, rather than conservation, is short-sighted. Thirdly, although the needs of humans are more important, the need to save endangered animals' homes is also equally important. Many communities benefit from a unique natural environment, and the economy grows as a result. This can be the best way to support the preservation of endangered animals. Lastly, a combination of both human and environment will ultimately benefit everyone, and sustainable development will bring about the best results.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.; And do not forget to use the text below for your answer! We are talking about the controversial question of whether university students should be required to attend classes or not. Both views are plausible, but I agree that going to classes should be mandatory. You must always go to university. The university is a place where the professor and students come together, where a rich exchange of ideas and thoughts take place. This communication between people gives a deeper understanding and memory of the material that is discussed. Universities are not only a place where you can learn, but also where you can grow personally and make many friends. Also, going to university is a social experience. On the other hand, proponents of voluntary attendance argue that it encourages personal responsibility and self-discipline. This can be true, but it can also lead to bad habits. These relationships may be of great value in the future, since they may lead to a job opportunity or a reference, which may not be available to a solitary student. In conclusion, although the idea of voluntary attendance may appeal to personal freedom, the advantages of compulsory attendance, namely the organization of learning, the social and practical skills acquired, outweigh the advantages of voluntary attendance. Some students may find it difficult to manage their time and put other interests ahead of their studies, which can have a significant negative effect on their education and their entire university experience. Universities are a place of learning, and not just a place where people go. A mandatory attendance at university gives a broader and more complete education.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;" One of the most important benefits of technology is automation. Through automation, the way of doing things has been greatly simplified. For example, the use of appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers has greatly reduced the time and energy spent on household chores; the use of applications and software to manage finances, schedules, and even buy groceries, people have more time to learn and play. Industry automation has also increased production efficiency and reduced labor intensity. Meanwhile, the Internet has greatly simplified the communication between people and people, so that they can learn new things and new cultures from home, and even take remote medical consultation in their homes. In addition, the technology has made great progress in terms of access to information and services. The use of smart phones and social media has greatly simplified the way people communicate, enabling them to communicate quickly across great distances. In this way, people not only save time, but also make life services and information more easily accessible to people, overcoming the barrier of distance. Meanwhile, the Internet also simplifies the relationship between family members and friends, and helps to maintain family relationships, especially long-distance family relationships, which are usually difficult to maintain. Finally, the use of teleworking and cloud computing has made people's work and life more balanced. The end result is that by using technology, people have more time and energy to devote to the study and creation of life."
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV."; I disagree that this attention is warranted or beneficial. In today's media, the public figures and celebrities have become a focal point for the public. I am firmly opposed to the view that this attention is needed or helpful. For example, at election times or during major disasters, the media often focus on sensational stories about public figures instead of giving information to citizens. The first reason is that the interest in celebrities and scandals distracts attention from serious and more important issues that require coverage. For example, social and political issues, climate change and financial problems are usually overshadowed by celebrities' personal relationships or fashions. For another thing, the constant scrutiny of celebrities' lives creates unrealistic standards and expectations in people. The glamorous life, often filtered through filters and headlines, can lead to an unhealthy obsession with perfection. The result is a society that is ill informed about major crises and excessively aware of the minutiae of the celebrity culture. Also, this focus on superficial accomplishments, beauty and wealth can obscure the value of intelligence, work and character. Finally, I believe that the media have a strong tendency to pay too much attention to the personal lives of public figures and celebrities. This is especially detrimental to younger people, who are influenced by such images and see them as a model for their own lives. A more balanced and factual reporting of the media could be more helpful to a healthy and well-informed society. This tendency not only distracts from the coverage of more serious world issues, but also promotes a superficial view of success and value among the audience.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.; I personally like the idea of moving in search of a new place, and here's why. Many people have pondered this question of staying or moving. The choice is very close and is often based on personal qualities, life conditions and personal ambitions. Moving to another place opens up new opportunities for experiencing different cultures, cuisines, and ways of life. Traveling opens up new opportunities for learning new customs and traditions that enrich our knowledge of the world. For example, exposure to different social rules expands the worldview, enables personal growth and sympathy for others. Traveling also contributes to a new sense of purpose and passion for life. Traveling also develops flexibility and a broader perspective in us, which are very useful in the global world of today. This dynamic view of life inspires us, instills creativity, and often leads to a personal breakthrough that would not have happened otherwise. Starting a new life in a new place is exciting. Deep friendships, family relationships, and local connections are very important for mental health. But in new places, connections are also established and connections are maintained. On the other hand, being in one place offers stability and a sense of belonging that cannot be ignored. Traveling not only develops our character, but also enriches the texture of our life. So, the decision to move to a new place has its advantages, but for me the main thing is the feeling of exploration and the opportunity to develop.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.; To explain this question, we have selected two paragraphs from the essay. The essay argues that university dormitories have special advantages for students. First of all, university dormitories are usually located in the vicinity of the university, where classes, libraries and extracurricular activities are located, and this easy access saves time and energy for students, which may enhance their academic experience. Students have more opportunities to socialize and exchange ideas and have the opportunity to establish friendships and group activities. Secondly, university dormitories are a community, and students live together in a group and the group is a community, and it is easy to deal with disputes and problems. On the other hand, community apartments offer more independence and freedom, and they have more space and privacy than dormitories, and they can live more freely and personalize their own lives. In addition, many dormitories also include meals, laundry, and electricity in the rental, which is a great convenience for students. In addition, students can choose roommates, and they can even live alone, which is more in line with individual preferences. Personally, I would like to live in the community. Also, I have more opportunities to be immersed in the local community, to learn about different cultures, and to establish a good social circle. Besides, it is more in line with my personal needs and aspirations, and it is better to have more freedom and independence to build life skills and develop my future life. I personally prefer to live in the community because although both places have their advantages and disadvantages, the advantages of living in the community better meet my personal needs and aspirations.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;" I fully agree with the above statement and the reasons for this are the speed of today's world, the progress of technology and the importance of flexibility in a dynamic environment. In our fast-paced world, the debate between speed and accuracy in the workplace is more relevant than ever. In today's digital age, businesses must be able to respond to the needs of consumers and the market, sometimes in real time. For example, when it comes to launching new products or releasing updates for software, companies that release their products more quickly and a little bit more often are often able to capture more market share, even if their first products have minor defects. Firstly, the rapid development of technology has changed the nature of work. Secondly, working quickly encourages the culture of experimentation and learning. It is only through experimentation and learning that businesses can continuously innovate and improve. Several companies, such as Google and Amazon, are well known for their fast, experimental ""fail fast"" culture, which encourages employees to try new ideas quickly and fail quickly. Thirdly, it is necessary to risk and make mistakes in many creative industries, so that they can continuously improve. Fourthly, it is important to maintain a balance between speed and accuracy, and encourage employees to work fast, but also establish quick error-correction mechanisms, to ensure that the efficiency of work is maintained while maintaining the core standards of the industry. In conclusion, although accuracy is still very important, the requirements of today's world and the benefits of a flexible and experimental culture of work have made it necessary to risk making mistakes in some cases."
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;" Though the level of knowledge gained from an exam shows the students’ level of knowledge, the benefits of attending classes go far beyond mere grades. Attending classes provides students with an environment for discussion and involvement. In conclusion, I disagree that university students need not attend classes. In a classroom setting, teachers can provide opportunities for group projects, debates and presentations that cannot be replicated in self-study or an online environment. This stimulates the student’s critical thinking and furthers a more complete understanding of the subject matter than can be achieved through self-study or an online environment. On the other hand, teachers and their students can develop valuable relationships through office hours, which may be useful for career guidance and professional collaboration. In conclusion, attending classes provides a means of developing valuable relationships with both teachers and fellow students that can be crucial to the students’ career development. If the class schedule is strict, students are forced to adopt a time management and organizational style, both of which are essential for success in the professional world. Attending class is a routine and a habit that can benefit the students in the long run. Finally, a student’s ability to pass an exam is an important measure of his success in the university; however, a more rewarding and fulfilling university experience involves more than just passing the exam. By attending classes, students can be involved in the broader university community, where they can learn about other views and broaden their own. Students’ intellectual, social and personal development are greatly aided by attending classes, and therefore class attendance is an essential part of their higher education."
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.; I agree that the university should allocate more money for the salaries of university professors, as this investment can lead to a great improvement in the quality of education. The quality of education in universities is a complex issue that is influenced by many factors, one of which is the remuneration of professors. The prestige of such famous universities as Stanford and Harvard University is in part due to the fact that they attract eminent professors with outstanding teaching skills to their faculty. If a university offers salaries that are a part of the salaries paid in the country, they are more likely to attract such high-quality professors. Professors who feel that they are valued and fairly paid for their work are more likely to dedicate themselves to their students, to the improvement of the curriculum and to the search for new teaching methods, which, in turn, enriches the learning experience and creates a favorable environment for the student. Secondly, a higher salary leads to higher motivation and satisfaction of teachers, which, in turn, leads to higher quality of teaching. Higher salaries also encourage professors to spend more time on research and professional development, which can then lead to a more positive impact on the quality of education. Professors who are involved in current research can bring their own new insights and cutting-edge knowledge into the classroom, which can further benefit the student. It has been shown that the success of the university is increased if the teachers are motivated. Universities that are more successful in attracting high-quality professors, whose motivation and research they encourage, create a more dynamic educational environment that benefits both students and society. In conclusion, a higher salary for university professors is an effective strategy to improve the quality of education.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.; - I fully agree with this statement. Firstly, the bond between the owner and the pet is strong and deep. Secondly, a dog or a cat, in particular, can easily become part of the family and must be treated with love, care and respect, like human family members. Just as a family member can help and support each other in difficult times, so can a pet. Pets are capable of bringing unconditional love, friendship and comfort, and they can be with us in moments of sadness and happiness, with a kind word and a warm hug. In addition, treating pets as family members gives them a better life. This provides a sense of belonging and well-being for both the pet and the owner. They are not considered property, but rather living beings who need to be respected and cared for. Family members teach us about empathy, responsibility and compassion. The best way to care for pets is to take care of them, to look after them, to give them good veterinary care, food and exercise. In conclusion, treating pets as family members enriches their lives and affects the emotional well-being of their human friends. This care is an obligation, similar to that of a family member. Therefore, this view of the world can make the lives of both pets and people happier. This is a demonstration that love and care can overcome all species and that our pets deserve family care and attention.
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.; It is clear that it is very important to work quickly, but I disagree that it is more important to work quickly than to work slowly and ensure accuracy. First, in many areas of work, such as medicine, engineering and finance, the consequences of mistakes are very serious. For example, in medicine, a hurried diagnosis or treatment can be very dangerous for a patient, even deadly. Similarly, mistakes in engineering structures, due to the hurried verification, can lead to a catastrophic failure, demonstrating that the cost of errors far exceeds the benefit of speed. Thus, ensuring accuracy rather than speed can save not only the health of the individual but also the company. And, in the end, many of today's companies emphasize quality in addition to speed. For example, such companies as Apple and Toyota have demonstrated that methodical work produces products that are both practical and reliable, and that a quality-focused approach leads to long-term success and customer loyalty. Consequently, careful work leads to confidence and reliability, which are indispensable in the world of business. These companies avoid rework by doing their job well from the very beginning, which means they save time and resources later. Similarly, a recent study by the Lean Enterprise Institute found that companies that spent more time on planning and quality control in the first place spent less time in the long run and saved time and money. Consequently, although the world of today values quick results, it is important to work carefully and make sure it is correct. In conclusion, although speed may be an advantage in some cases, it is important to maintain a balance between speed and quality.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.; Personally, I would prefer to live in a small town. The feeling of community, the slower pace of life and the natural surroundings are very attractive in small towns. There is a long-standing debate about whether people are better off in small towns or in big cities. There are a number of advantages in small towns, for example: local festivities, such as farmers' markets, bazaars and celebrations, are very popular and help strengthen community bonds. In a small town, people usually know each other and there is a greater sense of belonging and mutual support than in a big city. It gives people a sense of security and peace of mind. In a small town, life is usually slower, which is a refreshing change in today's fast-paced world. Also, many small towns are surrounded by beautiful natural surroundings and provide opportunities for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing and camping. The opportunity to enjoy nature not only promotes a healthy lifestyle but also offers a peaceful and peaceful escape from the bustle of city life. You can take a leisurely walk, have a picnic or just sit outside, which is a daily pleasure, rather than a special pleasure. In addition, the closeness to nature and the good sense of community create a way of life that values social relationships and well-being. In conclusion, although big cities offer a wide range of opportunities and entertainment, I prefer small towns for their strong community bonds, their slower pace of life and their natural surroundings. The chance to enjoy the fresh air and the starry sky is a luxury that many city dwellers never experience.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government."; This debate is complicated, but I firmly believe that new buildings should not take priority over the preservation of historic and traditional buildings. First, because the buildings are the story of the past, and the building is a living, historical and cultural heritage. By preserving these buildings, the government honors the stories of the past and strengthens the feeling of belonging of citizens. They remind us of our roots and keep us in the memory of the community. Many cities have successfully transformed their old buildings into lively, tourist hubs that attract visitors from around the world. Secondly, this often has an economic benefit, since the preservation of old buildings often attracts visitors and stimulates the local economy. In the increasingly homogenized world, cities that lose their old buildings can lose their unique character and fade into the background. Adapting existing buildings is also more cost-effective and sustainable than tearing down and building new ones. Finally, new buildings rather than preservation undermine the special characteristics of a city. We honor our past by investing in it, but we also boost our economy and enrich our communities for future generations. To sum up, although new buildings and roads are necessary for the development and prosperity of the city, they should not overshadow the need to preserve historic and traditional buildings.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.; In my opinion, if the challenges in our lives become valuable lessons in the future, they often build our courage and help us to face life in a more positive way. Firstly, the difficulties of life can be overcome. This can be seen in the case of a student who has not done well in an exam. It may be disheartening at first, but this is often the incentive to study better and ask for help when necessary, and this is not only a boost to his academic career, but also to his life. A person who takes part in a community project often has to deal with opposition and unexpected problems, and has to learn the skills of negotiating and teamwork. Secondly, the difficulties we encounter in life can be our most important teachers of life. Moreover, difficulties are a significant part of our growth as a person. These skills are essential in many areas of life, and in our work. For example, in our careers, when we have to deal with a difficult situation with our colleagues or with clients, the experience we have had in dealing with difficulties can make it easier to deal with the future situation. In conclusion, though difficult experiences can be painful and overwhelming, they can also be the starting point for building resilience, developing skills and growing as a person. The person who has lost a loved one may feel sad at first, but it can be a reflection of how much they have learned about their own needs and the importance of personal space, and can find that in the future they will have healthier relationships. A person who has had a major setback in life and has been forced to overcome adversity can achieve greater success in the future.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational."; I completely agree with this statement for several reasons. First, paying for driving in busy city streets can significantly reduce traffic congestion. Cities like London and Singapore have experienced a dramatic reduction in congestion after they introduced a congestion charge. In many large cities, congestion wastes time, increases pollution and causes stress to drivers. Incentives to drive in busy city streets may make them use public transport, bicycles or walk. Second, the money raised from the tax can be used to improve public transport, expand the network of bicycle lanes and pedestrian walkways, and enhance green spaces. These investments will not only reduce congestion but also contribute to the development of the city. Furthermore, the benefits of reducing congestion are enormous. It will help lower-income people have access to employment and essential services. It will also make people make more responsible transportation choices, provide funds for essential public services, and improve the environment. In conclusion, the idea of charging a fee for driving in busy city streets at busy times is consistent with the larger goals of urban sustainability and quality of life. Fewer cars on the road means lower emissions and better air quality, which are critical to combat climate change and improve public health. In a city, this idea can lead to a more sustainable and efficient urban future.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job."; In support of this view, there are several reasons: first, it makes the young man responsible. Management of schedules, deadlines and commitments gives a person the skills needed in the workplace and in life. Secondly, it makes it easier for a young man to manage his time, which is very important for an adult. Lastly, teenagers learn to communicate with co-workers, customers and supervisors, thus learning the importance of teamwork. Interpersonal and professional skills can also be developed in a part-time job. Moreover, financial literacy is an important tool that will help in the future when a young person manages money, debt and savings. This also gives the young person an opportunity to think about his future, work on his studies and understand the importance of hard work. A young person can also learn to manage finances better when he is an adult. Lastly, the value of an idea of work and career begins, which will help to develop the skills needed for a young person's future career. In conclusion, parents should encourage their teenagers to take part-time jobs to prepare them for adulthood.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone."; Personally, I prefer to study alone, and there are many reasons why I like to study alone. Academic study is an important part of a student's life, and there are many ways to study, some students are in favor of learning alone, some are in favor of group study. I like to learn alone because it is the most appropriate way for me to study. First of all, it can make me concentrate on learning, which is very difficult in a group. In addition, when I study alone, I can set my own learning plan and strategy, so I can follow my own pace of learning, and I can also give more time to difficult topics, so I understand the complex information in the class more deeply. I found that when I prepared for the exam, the answer to the questions in the book was more than ten times more effective than the answers I discussed with classmates. In addition, this individual strategy can make us use various learning methods, such as mind maps, flash cards and practice tests, to help us learn the most effective way. Finally, learning alone can cultivate our self-discipline and sense of responsibility. In this way, we can not only master the ability to learn alone, but also the ability to master ourselves. Learning alone is an important part of not only learning, but also life. I think the most conducive environment for learning is in solitude.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.; Self-employment gives a person the opportunity to structure his career in the direction of his interests and skills. The choice between self-employment, employment, and business ownership is related to a person's views on work, autonomy, and risk. I personally would rather be self-employed because I would have the freedom to pursue my passions and make independent decisions. For example, a self-employed graphic designer has the freedom to choose a client who shares his artistic vision rather than to pursue a particular business strategy. This freedom encourages creativity and innovation, which leads to a higher quality of work. Like working for an employer, when you have to cope with the office politics and strict office hierarchy, self-employment gives you the opportunity to create your own working conditions and make your own decisions. Self-employment also gives you greater independence and the opportunity to make decisions independently. Self-employment also offers the possibility of a better work-life balance. I would have time to spend with my family and myself, which is often hampered by a strict work schedule. Moreover, self-employment allows you to quickly adjust your strategy based on market feedback and your own experience, without having to seek permission from higher authorities. Self-employment offers a variety of benefits, and I believe that self-employment is the best way to be happy and successful. Although self-employment can be difficult and risky, the reward of living your life according to your own rules is worth it.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors."; It is clear that historic buildings are a link to the past, but not only that, they are also a source of pride and stimulation for the local economy. In the present essay, I will discuss this problem, and use the following reasons and examples to support my view. For example, cities like Paris and Rome have managed to preserve their historic buildings successfully, which not only reflect the rich history of these two cities, but also constitute an important part of their identity. The distinctive character of these cities draws a lot of tourists, which means that the local economy is booming. And these buildings tell stories about the culture, architecture and history of these places, which can help future generations understand the past. In addition, preserving historic buildings means protecting the environment, because instead of demolishing old buildings and creating new materials, cities can use existing materials. The preservation of historic buildings also strengthens community cohesion, because these buildings often serve as the backdrop for local events, and remind people of their own local memories. A good example of this is the regeneration of historic buildings in Detroit, which has both economic and green significance. In contrast, although the defenders of modern buildings argue that modern architecture better meets the needs of people's daily lives, it is also quite uninteresting. For example, these new buildings may seem cold and uninteresting, and the residents do not have the same sense of belonging and admiration as for old buildings. By keeping these buildings in use, the city also arouses the feelings of local residents, and enhances community cohesion. So I think that cities should focus on preserving historic buildings rather than destroying them, to protect their cultural heritage, support the development of green industry, and ensure that the history and stories of the past enrich the lives of the people.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.; Parents are the first teachers of children, who can help them build the foundations of knowledge and life skills. But I think education is a multi-faceted process, and it is not only teachers, mentors and life experience that a child learns from, and this is a process that depends on a lot of outside influences. Parents, for example, are the first to teach their children to share, to empathize and to communicate with others, and through this they lay the foundation for successful socialization. They teach children how to share and empathize and communicate with others, which is very useful for life and in the future. But as children grow older, their needs change and parents can no longer provide the same knowledge as other people, especially in the subjects of science, mathematics and history. This is the field where educators come in, with their special knowledge. And then there are the opportunities for socialization and the experience of other children and life experience outside the home. In addition, the various learning strategies that teachers have mastered, they can teach different learning styles, which a parent, no matter how well-intentioned and knowledgeable, can not achieve so well. For example, the child might have a hard time understanding some concepts in algebra, but the teacher would explain it in the right way. In conclusion, although parents have an important role in the education of values and basic skills, they are not necessarily the best teachers in all areas. Schools offer socializing and interaction with peers, and this can not be fully replaced by the family. And a mixed upbringing where the parents and educators work together, the child gets a broader foundation.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life."; I completely agree with this statement, as diversified work not only enhances job satisfaction, but also increases productivity and creativity. The statement that workers would be happier doing different types of tasks during the workday than doing the same task over and over again is very close to the present time when the world is full of various types of work. For example, an administrative worker who alternates between office work, client work and project work is likely to feel a sense of achievement for different challenges, which can greatly increase his happiness. Repetitive work is boring and dull, which affects motivation and pleasure. Work with different types of tasks can improve the skills of workers, and it is a continuous learning activity, which makes the team more dynamic and workers more valuable and valued. Finally, it also improves the skills of workers, which not only enhances the ability of workers to learn, but also improves the quality of their work. Moreover, different tasks can make workers work together with different teams or departments, and the feeling of unity and belonging is also an important basis for workers' satisfaction. The recent research on organizational psychology has found that employees who do a variety of work are more committed to their companies and have higher satisfaction. By reducing monotony, promoting skills, and enhancing collaboration, the use of diversified work not only improves the efficiency of work, but also increases the satisfaction of employees. Then, workers will feel more connected to each other, which will make them happier.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.; The present day job market is characterized by frequent changes in technology, organization and methods. In this case, knowledge is undeniably important, but the ability to adapt to changing conditions is very important in dealing with rapid change in the working environment. For example, a project manager who is a good planner, but who is inflexible to changes in the scope of the project and the team, will find it difficult to cope with the new situation. The ability to adapt quickly and correctly to new situations is therefore very important for an employee who works in a new environment. In addition, the current working environment requires the ability to work in a team and to develop effective communication with diverse colleagues. In such cases, adaptability ensures that a person is still effective even in an uncertain situation. In contrast, an employee with great knowledge of the work, but who is rigid and inflexible, will have a difficult time in a dynamic working environment. Such rigidity hinders the personal growth of an employee, but also the progress of the entire team. The willingness to learn from others and the openness to new ideas facilitate the exchange of experiences and ideas, thus encouraging innovation and the development of project success. Adaptability allows a person to develop, to cooperate and to thrive in an uncertain environment. This leads to greater career success.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.; On the one hand, many daily activities are certainly easier because of the convenience that computers provide. On the other hand, I think that many conveniences that computers bring also create complexity that often causes stress. For example, people can easily find information on the Internet, so they can find out what they want in a few seconds. The Internet has also facilitated a lot of work at home, so there is more time for personal life. For example, on the Internet, you can use a credit card to pay for things and buy things from the comfort of your home. Also, we are connected through emails, social media, and notifications all the time, which means we are always on call. This is what I mean by a constant alert. On the other hand, the Internet provides a lot of information, so we are often overwhelmed and the source of the information is not always reliable. For example, older people often find it difficult to use the Internet and the computer, which leads to a sense of isolation from the increasingly digital world. Moreover, rapid technological changes make some people feel insecure and frustrated. To be able to enjoy the benefits of the digital world, people must find a balance between being productive and enjoying a good life. Finally, although computers have certainly made life easier and more convenient, they have also made it more complex and stress-free.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.; I am strongly in favor of the opinion that foreign languages should be taught to children from an early age. Foreign language education helps children develop their language skills, enhances their cultural awareness, and opens up opportunities for them in the future. When foreign language education is integrated into the curriculum from the very beginning, children develop a deeper understanding of language and acquire greater language skills. During childhood, children's brains are especially flexible and open to learning new sounds, words, and grammatical structures. This ability decreases with age. Children learn not only the language, but also the culture. In today's globalized world, it is important to understand different cultures. We can get rid of stereotypes and prejudices, and open up the possibility of more open-mindedness in the future. Students who learn Spanish can learn to appreciate the rich traditions of Spanish-speaking countries, and they can develop the ability to recognize and respect different cultures. Besides, the knowledge that children learn from foreign languages is of great value to them throughout their lives. In today's highly competitive labor market, companies are increasingly demanding a foreign language skill. For example, a Chinese language learner can have an advantage in some companies doing business in China. These reasons prove that foreign language learning should be an integral part of a child's school life. In conclusion, it is important for a child to learn a foreign language from an early age, so that children can develop their intellectual development, understand different cultures, and open up opportunities for their future careers.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.; I strongly disagree with the idea that boys and girls should attend separate schools. Coeducation has many advantages that not only contribute to academic growth, but also prepare students for intersex interactions. The debate about whether boys and girls should attend separate schools raises important issues about education, gender and social relations. Boys and girls learn to work together and communicate in ways that are important for both academic and professional life. For example, group projects often require different perspectives and collaboration between opposite sexes brings out the most creative and effective solutions to problems. First, coeducation promotes the development of mutual respect and understanding between boys and girls. In separate classes, boys may be expected to conform to a more masculine image that limits emotional expression, while girls are expected to be more conservative. Coeducational classes can help students to break free of stereotypes and develop interests and talents regardless of their gender. An important objection to separating the sexes in schools is that it may lead to poorer academic performance. Research has shown that the benefits of separate classes, such as fewer distractions and more confidence, are not as important when the impact of a school is considered over a longer period of time. A boy who is interested in drama or a girl who excels in science should not feel limited by gender expectations. It is better to let them explore and develop their own interests. Finally, coeducation leads to the development of good intersex relations, enhances learning and prepares students for life in a diverse society. To conclude, I strongly believe that boys and girls should not attend separate schools. Coeducation has been shown to produce equally, or even more, successful students than separate schools. Boys and girls should learn and develop together. In this way, we are promoting a balanced and harmonious future.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life."; In my opinion, the most effective way to achieve success is a combination of both approaches, because they complement each other. The first is that taking risks is essential for development and the acquisition of opportunities. For example, J.K. Rowling was rejected many times before Harry Potter became a success, but the author had the courage to take risks and fail many times before she achieved a great success. The same thing happened to the entrepreneur Steve Jobs and the athlete Michael Jordan. Risk-taking can lead to extraordinary results, but not without a clear plan. This is because careful planning is like a road map that helps us find our way. A good plan limits the damage of a mistake and prepares us for a possible failure, which increases the chances of success. For example, starting a new business requires not only courage to start, but also a plan of action, including a business model, market research and a marketing strategy. And those who know how to combine both elements are more likely to achieve success.
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live."; I agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things they don't like to do. While pursuing personal interests and passions is important for the happiness of a person, there are also many advantages in doing things that one doesn't like to do. Many adults are faced with the fact that their job requires them to acquire and develop skills that they do not like, such as public speaking or analyzing financial reports, for example. Although such things are not usually pleasant, they are still necessary for personal development. Second, doing things we don't like can make us more responsible and responsible. There are always obligations, such as chores, work and social duties. Someone who doesn't like to write might write an essay and improve his communication skills, which could benefit his personal and professional life. The ability to take on responsibilities and overcome obstacles is also beneficial for personal development. For example, a student who does not like to attend a particular class but is aware of the value of education, attends the classes and learns discipline and self-control, which prepares him for future challenges. Moreover, many of our social interactions involve compromising, such as spending time with family or friends doing something that is not especially exciting. Often, the efforts made by a person to do something that he does not like actually strengthens the relationship, as he demonstrates his willingness to invest in relationships, even if it requires some sacrifice. It is important to combine both kinds of activities in life in order to have a balanced and complete life.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.; I disagree with the statement. It is more important to preserve historical buildings, because it is a long-standing cultural heritage that helps maintain our identity and community pride and promotes sustainable urban development. The controversy about the question of whether governments should spend money on new buildings rather than preserving historic or traditional buildings is very complex and difficult. We honor the accomplishments and struggles of those who came before us, and preserve them for future generations. In the first place, historic buildings are a testimony to our past, a symbol of architectural styles, a testimony to social values, and a testimony to historical events that have shaped the communities. In addition, the investment in the preservation of historic buildings can be an economic benefit to local businesses, because the building attracts tourists. The architecture of a city is often the main element of its charm and the life of its residents and visitors. In addition, the restoration of old buildings is often more sustainable than building new ones, because it reduces the waste of materials and helps achieve today's sustainable goals. For example, in some cities where the heritage building is famous, the tourism industry flourishes, which means that jobs are created and the economy is stimulated. Often the new construction of a city prioritises profit over community, which often results in homogeneous and meaningless construction, while preservation preserves local identity and strengthens community cohesion. Moreover, new construction, while it can also be beneficial, can lead to the loss of local character and the displacement of long-term residents. It is in the government's interest to ensure that new and old buildings are given equal importance, because in this way they will create vibrant, diverse, and sustainable communities that will cherish the past while shaping the future. In conclusion, although the construction of new buildings contributes to progress, the preservation of old buildings is an important factor in maintaining cultural heritage.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.; One of the main advantages of early independence is the opportunity for self-discovery. Although both alternatives have advantages, I believe that young adults who prefer early independence from their parents can learn useful life skills and mature better than those who choose to live with their parents for a long time. For example, a young adult who lives independently learns to manage his expenses, which makes him a financial expert throughout his life. When young adults go out on their own, they are faced with practical responsibilities such as managing their own finances, cooking and maintaining a household. These responsibilities help them develop problem-solving and decision-making skills, which are important to personal development. Living in a new place and facing the difficulties of a difficult job market and unexpected expenses teaches young adults to be patient and resourceful. Besides, when young adults are forced to overcome obstacles and difficulties without the help of their parents, they develop greater responsibility and confidence. Young adults who choose to stay at home can miss the experience that will help them to become independent adults. Although it is true that there is a sense of security and well-being at home, this situation can also limit personal development and create a sense of dependency in the future. In the end, such difficulties contribute to the formation of character and prepare a person for the complexities of adult life. On the other hand, a desire for early independence gives young people the opportunity to acquire the skills and self-confidence they need to grow and become mature, successful and satisfied adults. Research shows that those who are not independent too early are less capable of coping with everyday problems and difficulties in the workplace or personal relationships, and lack the experience of maturity. Consequently, I believe that the solution that is better for young people is to leave their families sooner rather than later.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.; The spread of social media, instant messengers and applications for distance communication has made communication between people easier and more immediate. This change has had both positive and negative effects on the type of relationships people make. Social media has made it possible to build connections with people far away from where they live, based on common interests, not proximity. A significant change is the emergence of virtual friendships. The many relationships people make today are largely based on virtual communication, and thus face-to-face communication has been reduced. On the one hand, this democratization of relationships has been a positive development that has given rise to support networks and increased tolerance. On the other hand, it has also increased superficiality. The rise of the digital self-portrait has led to misunderstandings, as the inflections of human expression are not fully conveyed in written language. The whole situation has raised questions about the overall quality of relationships and people's well-being. People may have many connections with others, but it often does not turn into deep relationships. The demands of social media can also make a person forget about their real life and family and friends, and they can then feel isolated and lonely. People who want to take advantage of the benefits of technology while reducing its disadvantages should try to combine digital interactivity with true face-to-face communication. To conclude, technology has indisputably changed the way people interact, making it possible to connect more broadly, but also raising questions about depth and authenticity.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.; The increasing use and development of new technology has brought about a major transformation, with machines being able to take over many of the tasks which people used to perform. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages which are worthy of examination. For example, robots in factories can assemble products faster and more accurately than people. This not only reduces the time taken to produce goods but also reduces the possibility of human error, thereby contributing to better quality products. Machines can work incessantly and carry out repetitive tasks more accurately and quickly than people. With this automation, there are obvious advantages, such as saving time and energy, but there are also disadvantages, particularly in the area of employment. When machines are able to perform tasks that people have been doing, there are fears that jobs will be lost. In addition, machines can free people from boring and physically demanding work, and they can use their skills and creativity to perform more complex and creative tasks. Moreover, this trend towards automation can create anxiety and resistance among employees who feel that they do not have the skills needed to keep pace with developments in technology. The fear of unemployment for skilled workers may lead to higher unemployment and greater social disparity. In conclusion, the automation of work has many advantages in terms of increased productivity and efficiency, but it also brings disadvantages in the areas of employment and skill retention. As people become increasingly dependent on technology, their basic skills, such as problem solving and communication, may decline.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.; I believe that in the last 20 years, advances in information technology have had a positive influence on the way we communicate, do business and learn. However, in my opinion, with the spread of IT, the risk to our personal information is increasing. One of the main problems is that the state does not control enough data. Moreover, the spread of artificial intelligence (AI), although bringing greater efficiency and innovation, poses a risk to human jobs. With automation taking over the jobs that have been performed by people, many will lose their jobs and have to be retrained. In the long run, the risk of misuse of personal data can lead to more serious social problems such as discrimination, harassment and even violence. Moreover, the social media platforms that have transformed the way we communicate have also made misinformation widely spread and contributed to the polarization of society. The ability to spread false information quickly can have serious consequences for public health, democracy and social cohesion. This development can increase inequality and lead to further divisions in society between those who can use new technology and those who cannot. However, the positive development of IT, with its many benefits, is a risk as well, and it is important to strike a balance between innovation and good security to prevent future progress from causing more harm than good. On the other hand, technological development is undeniably beneficial, with a significant improvement in medical treatment, more opportunities for learning and more interconnectedness in the world. In conclusion, despite the many benefits that IT brings, it is likely that future developments will have more negative effects than positive.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.; First of all, constant exposure to the celebrities' luxurious lifestyle and the unreal values they represent can evoke in a child a distorted concept of success and happiness. Although there may be those who would say that the coverage of celebrities is harmless or even beneficial, I firmly believe that the excessive focus on the culture of celebrities has a harmful effect on the child's development and self-esteem. This is because young minds are very susceptible, and without proper guidance, the values of the celebrity culture can be confused with the more meaningful ones, such as kindness, hard work and sincerity. Children can be made to feel that their value is directly proportional to their appearance and possessions, and this can lead to problems with self-esteem and body image. Also, the coverage of the celebrities focuses on negative phenomena such as violence, sexual promiscuity and drug abuse. Children who idolize these celebrities can learn from them that these phenomena are acceptable and even desirable. This can lead to unhealthy lifestyle choices and poor decision-making. Also, the coverage of celebrities can create a culture of bullying and shaming among young people, who feel obliged to live their lives in a certain way, because they see their role models live in a certain way. In conclusion, although the coverage of celebrities can be entertaining, its inordinate focus on them is dangerous to the child's development and self-esteem. It is therefore essential that parents and guardians take the time to have sincere conversations with children about the reality of celebrity culture and encourage them to develop healthier and more sustainable role models.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems."; They are arguing that the technology, in particular, the mobile phone, is a means of communication, which allows people to stay in touch with each other no matter how far away they are. I believe that mobile phones are a means of communication that not only strengthens relationships, but also helps to build them. For example, a student abroad can maintain close family and friendly ties through regular communication with his family and friends. Families, separated by many miles, can share moments through text messages, phone calls and video chats, thus creating a closeness that would have been impossible without this communication. Far from destroying, a mobile phone can help create relationships, by exposing the person to new ideas and views. On the other hand, social networks accessed through mobile phones can help people find and interact with people with similar interests, hobbies and goals. This can lead to the development of real friendships and further broaden one's social network. A person who is absorbed in the virtual world can also miss opportunities to establish meaningful relationships with people around him. However, it is important to point out the potential negative effects of mobile phones. In my opinion, a person who constantly communicates with others through mobile phones may have a very limited social circle, as he is constantly trying to communicate with many different people. Finally, although mobile phones can distract from personal communication, they can ultimately serve as powerful tools for social interaction, when used properly. This is because the main thing is to keep the balance between virtual and real communication, and use technology to enhance relationships, rather than deteriorate them.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.; In our technologically advanced society, the development of modern means of communication such as email and messaging has no doubt had an effect on how we communicate with others. While these tools have provided a convenient and efficient way to keep in touch, I argue that they have reduced the quality of our social lives and have reduced the number of times we see our friends in person. In the first place, the speed and immediacy of messages can lead to shallow conversations. As a result, we are more likely to have a quick exchange of views than a meaningful and in-depth conversation, which allows us to develop a real friendship. It is the inadequacy of text-based communication, which removes body language, tone, and emotional depth, that gives us the impression that we are communicating more than we actually are. When it is easy to make arrangements or catch up, the need to actually meet in person diminishes. Secondly, the ease of digital communication can lead to complacency about meeting in person. The social medial platforms create an illusion of intimacy, whereby people feel they are interacting with their friends when they spend hours scrolling through the newsfeed, rather than engaging with them directly. Consequently, the desire to meet in person may be diminished, resulting in less face-to-face communication. Finally, it is my view that while these new forms of communication have their advantages, they have significantly reduced the amount of time people spend with their friends in person, which has, in turn, a negative effect on our social lives. They can lead to feelings of isolation, since people can feel surrounded by virtual community, but they do not have real-life connections.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life."; Encouragement of competition in children may give them a sense of achievement and self-reliance. Competition encourages them to do their best. Cooperation in sport, for example, teaches children discipline, self-reliance and self-reliance, preparing them for a life where competition is often inescapable. In later life, children who have been taught to work together are better able to adapt to the complex social relationships of modern society. Cooperation and good communication are necessary for solving the common problems of society, such as climate change or the spread of epidemics. In my opinion, the most effective way of raising children is to encourage them to be good at both competition and cooperation. Competition makes children feel strong and invincible, but it also teaches them the value of co-operation. They become well-rounded, responsible and independent adults who understand the value of competition and co-operation in a world of competition.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;" Technology is changing the way people interact and communicate. Through social media and instant messaging, technology has rearranged the landscape of communication and introduced both opportunities and challenges to our relationships. One of the most important things technology has changed is the way we make friends with each other. Like Skype and Whatsapp offer real-time communication between friends and family living in different countries. In addition, online dating services have revolutionized the dating scene and allowed people to meet people beyond their immediate social circles, which can lead to more diverse and intercultural relationships. Today, people can have a close relationship with people far away from them, which would have been very difficult in the past. However, the digitalization of communication has also brought some disadvantages to our relationships. The fact that many people communicate more via text message than in person can affect the development of deeper emotional bonds, since non-verbal communication is lost in such conversations. Many people feel lonely despite being connected to each other all the time. This means that technology has brought a double edge to our relationships; while it has undoubtedly opened up for more opportunities to meet people from different backgrounds, it can also lead to a superficiality and superficiality in the relationships. Also, the elaboration of social media profiles can create an unrealistic expectation of others and lead to a sense of inadequacy. In the end, the effect of technology on relationships depends on how it is used. It can either enrich the relationships or, on the contrary, detract from them. It is therefore important to find the right balance between the benefits and the disadvantages of technology in our relationships."
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.; The position that the development of technology means the end of tradition is a complex and important one, and deserves to be carefully examined. It is true that modern influences may at first put a strain on traditions, but to regard their preservation as pointless is a sweeping generalization. This kind of judgment fails to take into account the intrinsic value of the older skills. In agriculture, for instance, automation means higher yields with less work, and seems to make old ways of farming unnecessary. But there are also many cultures in which modern farming is practised alongside more time-honoured methods, such as the use of livestock, to good effect. Tradition and technology do not necessarily have to go hand in hand. For one thing, in the face of the threat of climate change, there is an increased recognition of the value of sustainable farming methods. The old ways may thus be continued alongside the new, to improve productivity without totally destroying the skills that are the traditional hallmark of a particular culture. To conclude, although technology is undoubtedly transforming our societies, the total disappearance of traditional skills and ways of life is neither necessary nor desirable. By acknowledging their continuing relevance, and the adaptability of older methods, it is possible to find a harmonious balance between old and new. Moreover, indigenous knowledge, which has been passed down from generation to generation, is gaining new respect, as is the need for a balance between the old and the new.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.; Competition can teach children to be resilient, ambitious, and driven to succeed. Children who participate in sports, academic competitions, and other forms of performance gain self-confidence and learn to handle successes and failures. Competition is a form of learning that teaches the skills of adulthood, because children learn to work with each other and share. Cooperation can also help children develop skills like empathy, communication, and group work. Cooperation advocates believe that if children are taught to focus on cooperation, they will be more active members of society as adults. They believe that cooperation makes children feel better and less isolated, and that this feeling is based on competition. In today's world, a person must have the ability to work well with others to be successful in all areas, from work to the community. In my opinion, it is best for educational and social institutions to create opportunities for children to compete and cooperate with each other. A healthy sense of competition can be an incentive for children to excel, while teaching them to cooperate can give them the social skills they need to succeed in the future. Children need to be prepared for the complexity of adult life, to be competent and cooperative adults.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.; This debate about whether advertising does more harm than good is a complex issue with a number of nuances. The proponents of advertising point out that it serves several beneficial purposes. First, it informs consumers about new products and services so that they can make informed decisions. Second, it creates competition between companies so that consumers get a better deal. For example, consumers learn about new technological products or new medicines. On the other hand, the opponents of advertising claim that advertising is a major source of materialism and consumerism, which has serious negative consequences for society, and that people develop unrealistic expectations about the lives they lead and the possessions they own. Also, advertising provides a large source of revenue for media companies, which is important for economic development. Ads that are directed at vulnerable audiences, such as children, raise ethical issues because they may have a strong influence on them. For example, they may present an unattainable ideal lifestyle, which could cause feelings of inadequacy and self-esteem. There is a need for government regulation to ensure that the interests of consumers are put before profit. In my view, advertising may have some benefits for the economy and for providing information to consumers, but it may also have adverse effects on mental health and on society’s values.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste."; Some artists get an astonishing price for their art, while others are struggling to survive in a very competitive art world. It is a complicated matter and it reflects broader social values and the characteristics of the art market. The fact that a small number of artists profit enormously from their art work, leads to the impression that talent alone brings success, while many other equally talented and enthusiastic artists are struggling to get a reputation and financial support. On the other hand, the art market is very susceptible to trends, demand and speculation, and the prices for art are greatly influenced by the media and major auctions. On the other hand, like any other market, the art market works best when it is driven by the law of supply and demand. It seems unfair to allow the art community to work in such an unbalanced way, especially when the creative expression is essential for cultural and social expression. However, I believe the government can play a role in making it more even. Grants, subsidies, tax breaks for new artists and financial support for art education can improve opportunities for those who struggle. On the other hand, direct government intervention may limit creativity, leading to a one-size-fits-all model that does not recognize individual artists’ unique contributions. However, the art market is unpredictable, and the government should strive to make the art world more balanced and thus ensure that all artists have opportunities. By addressing the inequalities in the art world, we ensure a richer cultural life that values and elevates the contribution of every artist.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person."; Work longer hours is a recent trend. Nowadays people work longer hours than before. Although some people argue that long hours of work bring economic benefits and that there are more job opportunities, I believe that long hours of work bring more problems than benefits. First of all, it is harmful to the health and welfare of individuals. If employees are exhausted, their physical and mental health will decline, resulting in a decrease in their productivity and increased absenteeism. A number of diseases caused by overwork, such as depression, heart disease and anxiety, have been found. In addition, working overtime will have a negative impact on family life. The family members of employees who work overtime may miss many important family events, and they are unable to form close relationships with their families. In this way, they not only affect the health of individuals, but also increase the burden on the health system and social security, which are the broader social implications of overwork. Finally, working overtime brings about a culture of overwork and busyness, which is conducive to a vicious cycle of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Family relationships will weaken, leading to problems such as child neglect and family conflict. Eventually, the social fabric will be weakened, because strong families are the foundation of a healthy society. It is clear that the harmful effects of long hours of work on individuals, families and society cannot be underestimated. I strongly believe that a law should be imposed on overtime, which will lead to a healthier and more balanced work-life balance and ultimately a more efficient and productive workforce.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.; First of all, success is multifaceted and subjective. Although money can be a measure of success, it is not the only one. For example, teachers, social workers, and health workers often work long hours for modest salaries, but their contribution to society is invaluable, and they may be seen as successful in the sense that they have changed people's lives for the better. So for some people, particularly in some altruistic professions or in their personal endeavors, success may mean not only money, but the possibility of changing someone's life. In other words, some people are happy with their modest lives and enjoy their families, relationships, and hobbies. Success is then measured in happiness and overall satisfaction in life. This view could also result in a society that values wealth over creativity, values, and emotional well-being. Conversely, a rich person who is unhappy or isolated may still feel unhappy despite his wealth. In my opinion, true success should be measured in terms of personal development, contribution to society, and overall happiness.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.; This essay will be based on the following: Firstly, it is obvious that advertising influences consumer behavior. However, it is reductive to ignore the needs of society for these products. In the first case, smart phone manufacturers, for example, with the help of smart phone advertising, create the need to have the latest model of the phone in order to achieve social status. In the second case, smart phone advertising, through the media of television, social media, print and even in-person advertising, creates the need for a particular product that the target audience needs, wants or needs for their daily life or to achieve a certain social status. This causes a surge in sales, often exceeding the true need for these products. Secondly, the increase in the sale of popular consumer goods can be explained by the fact that the needs of the target audience have changed due to the development of technology and the penetration of the population into the most elite layers of society. In this case, the products that meet the needs of the public, in many cases, not only meet the needs of the public, but also meet the needs of society, and not only are products of advertising. For example, the high sales of electric cars show the development of society towards a more sustainable economy, partly due to increased marketing, partly due to the emergence of the public's awareness of climate change and the desire to drive a more environment-friendly vehicle. It is possible to say that high sales are a consequence of the interplay between the power of advertising and the real needs of the public. In conclusion, although advertising undoubtedly affects the increase in sales by its persuasive power, real social needs also affect the behavior of the public.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.; Firstly, taxes are necessary for the functioning of the state. However, I will argue that if taxation is seen as the only way of contributing to the public finances, it ignores other important ways of engaging in public life. All individuals who pay taxes undoubtedly make a positive contribution to the social well-being of their community. The State funds education, hospitals, roads and security, thus enabling communities to thrive. On the other hand, participating in local community work such as voluntary work in homeless shelters or neighborhood clean-up days involves contributing time and energy to a community directly. It makes a contribution to the quality of life, to relationships and to the sense of belonging that money alone cannot. To conclude, paying taxes is a crucial element of contribution to society but it should not be viewed in isolation. Similarly, taking part in the democratic process through voting and participating in town-hall meetings ensures that a diverse range of views is heard and represented in the political system. Thus, a more comprehensive approach to civic participation involves both financial and active engagement in local communities. In order for individuals to fully enrich society, they must be involved in many different ways.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound."; The debate on the focus of school curricula often centres on the priority of academic subjects that directly relate to a child’s future career, compared with subjects like music and sport. Certainly, subjects such as mathematics, science and technology are vital for the study of certain subjects, such as engineering and medicine. That makes the prioritization of these subjects seem sensible from a purely pragmatic viewpoint. However, such a focus ignores the fact that children have a diverse range of skills and interests, and that they should be given the opportunity to develop them. Music, for example, develops creativity and critical thinking skills, which can help with problem-solving in the work environment. The addition of sport to the school curriculum does not just add variety, but also helps to develop certain life skills that can be useful regardless of one’s career. This is a particular advantage when it comes to building resilience and managing stress. Besides, a narrow focus on academic subjects can lead to burnout. The arts, on the other hand, encourage emotional intelligence and cultural awareness, which are now considered to be particularly useful in the modern, globalized world. A well-balanced curriculum, therefore, should be one that cultivates both academic skills and personal growth, thereby preparing children not just for their careers but for life itself. In conclusion, while schools do need to teach students subjects that relate to their future careers, they should also be encouraged to include subjects like music and sport in the curriculum.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.; In my opinion, the internet will largely affect the way we get news, but it will not destroy the era of newspapers and magazines. The web provides access to unrivaled immediacy and availability. This immediacy has captured the audience, especially the younger generation, which likes the short, largely visual information that is mostly found on the web. It is able to meet the needs of a fast-moving world in real time. For example, during important events such as elections or natural disasters, news agencies can immediately provide continuous news, which newspapers cannot. This immediacy is also an important reason why some readers value the quality and depth of the articles and opinions that newspapers and magazines provide, and newspapers and magazines cannot immediately compete with the quality and depth of the articles they publish. However, in this age of information overload, the value of thoughtfully arranged content is not small. In addition, print media are more tactile than the web. The pleasure of reading a newspaper or magazine while drinking a cup of coffee cannot easily be replaced by scrolling on the screen. For example, such publications as the New Yorker or The Economist continue to thrive, and high-quality journalism with in-depth content is still sought by readers who pay for it. Newspapers and magazines will find a way to work in a new way in the new digital world and meet the needs of readers who value immediacy and depth. In conclusion, the internet has greatly changed the news industry, but newspapers and magazines will not disappear. This is because the physical form and the content are appreciated by many readers and therefore valued by many readers.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.; When choosing a job, the salary is an important factor, but the salary is not the only consideration. It is obvious that salary is an important consideration, but if it is the most important consideration, it is a misunderstanding of the complexity of job choice. Not only does salary play a significant role in meeting the basic needs of life and providing a comfortable life, but also many other factors are conducive to job satisfaction. For example, a high-paid job that is excessively occupied, long hours, and little free time, if it leads to personal fatigue, will inevitably be less desirable than a lower-paid job that can combine work and life and is satisfied with the person. , this is an important consideration, and salary is often accompanied by security and stability. The work environment, the opportunities for career development, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and even the enthusiasm of the individual are all indispensable factors that lead to a good job. Also, there are certain personal preferences and personal ambitions that must be taken into account. There are many high-paid jobs, but many of them also come with high-pressure, high-stress jobs, which are prone to unemployment. Compared to a stable salary, it is much more secure and has long-term value. In short, although the salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it should not be the most important consideration. For example, people who choose education, social services, and medical care are often influenced by the needs of society, but they have low salaries. Also, the meaning of a career can be realized in the long run, so we must take into account the satisfaction of our own jobs and the work environment when we make a career choice.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.; I would argue that the more children use the computers, the more negative their consequences. Firstly, the constant use of a computer can have a bad effect on their health. Although computers offer educational opportunities and communication, I would argue that a constant use of a computer has more disadvantages than advantages. In addition, the mental health of children can be seriously affected. Using the computer means spending hours sitting in front of the screen, resulting in a sedentary life, which can lead to health problems such as obesity and bad posture. Children are also exposed to cyberbullying, which is becoming more and more common in the digital age, and this may lead to a decrease in emotional development and later psychological issues. Besides, the virtual world can lead to the pressure to live a life that is better than their real one, which in turn leads to anxiety, low self-esteem and depression. Also, a constant use of a computer may have a bad effect on the thinking ability of children. Children can become addicted to technology, which means they no longer develop the ability to think critically. Also, children who are constantly using a computer miss out on the opportunity to make direct eye contact with others, which is very important for their social development and emotional intelligence. The latter mental short cuts may also affect their academic performance and creativity. However, the potential physical health problems, mental health problems, weakened mental development and weakened social skills indicate that moderation and thoughtful use are essential for the digital age. In conclusion, although the use of a computer has educational and communicational advantages, the use of a computer every day has more disadvantages than advantages.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.; Children who grow up in families where money is scarce are often faced with a variety of challenges that can stimulate their personal development and increase their resiliency. The view that children brought up in poor families are better able to deal with the problems of adulthood than those brought up in wealthy families is a complex view and deserves careful analysis. Children from poor families have to make do with less and learn to make do with less, which can lead to innovation and flexibility as an adult. They also develop a sense of the value of hard work, as they see their parents struggling to support the family. Their greater awareness of the hardships faced by others can develop in them a sense of compassion and a commitment to social justice. A life spent navigating the world’s wealth disparities can also lead to a sense of gratitude and a desire to give something back to society. These traits, combined with the sense of financial security that comes with wealth, can also lead to a sense of entitlement and a lack of resilience when faced with obstacles. At the same time, it is important to recognize that children from wealthy families also have certain advantages that can ease their transition into adulthood. Ultimately, the ability to cope with adulthood is influenced by many things other than financial circumstances, including personal character, support systems, and life experiences. In conclusion, although both upbringings present opportunities and obstacles, children brought up in poor families may have a better foundation for dealing with adult problems because of the resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness they develop.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.; I strongly agree that many of the medical problems we see today, such as obesity, heart problems, diabetes and even mental health problems, can be blamed on a sedentary lifestyle. In today's society the link between the sedentary life style and the rise in health problems has become more and more apparent. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is one of the most common reasons for global mortality. Sedentary jobs and overexposure to screen media play a major role in reducing physical activity. Also mental health is affected by this sedentary lifestyle. Lack of exercise leads to weight gain, which in turn leads to obesity and the risk of many chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Moreover, the sedentary behavior that characterizes modern life also has a social impact. When people are largely inactive, they miss out on the psychological benefits of physical activity, which can have negative effects on mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which improve mood and help us feel good. Activity promotes this mood. Also, being active in groups is an important way to increase physical and social well-being. In conclusion, I strongly believe that the increase in medical problems is largely due to the sedentary lifestyle. So, a cultural shift that values movement more than immobility is necessary to reduce these medical problems.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children."; This issue has attracted much attention. Many experts support the start of language classes in kindergarten. I also support this opinion. Early acquisition of a foreign language leads to near-native pronunciation and fluency, which becomes more and more difficult later. Firstly, children are able to learn languages more easily than adults. At this age, the brain is very flexible and easy to learn new sounds, grammar and vocabulary. Foreign language training at an early age can also promote the development of intelligence. Recent studies have shown that bilingual children have a much higher level of problem-solving ability, creativity and multi-tasking skills than monolingual children. Starting in kindergarten means using this critical period of linguistic development. In addition, learning a foreign language at an early age makes children more sensitive to other cultures. The ability to critically analyze different grammar structures and their meanings develops their ability to be more flexible and innovative, which is especially important in our increasingly interconnected world where communication between cultures is so important. Despite all the difficulties that may arise in the implementation of foreign language classes in kindergarten, such as the need to train teachers and align curricula, the long-term benefits of this program outweigh the inconvenience. Young learners become more open-minded and ready to communicate with people from different cultural backgrounds. They develop a wider world view and empathy, which is important for the harmonious development of the global community. In view of the above, I firmly believe that foreign language classes should begin in kindergarten. By encouraging foreign language education at this formative stage, we are not only teaching children a new way of communication, but also preparing them for a multilingual society.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.; Write an essay for this task. The undeniable advantages of international tourism cannot be denied. However, some people believe that the benefits of international tourism are being overshadowed by the many problems that have emerged. Because millions of tourists are coming to the country every year, the country will receive a large amount of foreign currency, which is very important for improving the country's economy and services. International tourism has a great economic benefit to the host country. It can provide income for the country, create jobs for the local population, and develop local businesses. But the disadvantages of international tourism are becoming more and more prominent and harmful. In terms of the environment, the amount of air pollution and the exploitation of natural resources, there is no doubt that the environment has been seriously damaged. Then there are other problems, such as social problems, such as pollution, such as the effect of foreign tourists on the country's culture. The growth of international tourism has led to the formation of a so-called overcrowded tourist destination, which has seriously affected the interests of the tourist places. At the same time, the affluent tourist places are often overcrowded, which not only affects the interests of tourists, but also affects the interests of the local residents. In addition, international tourism also led to the gap between the rich and the poor to increase. This is reflected in the fact that the cost of living has risen sharply, and the customs and traditions of the local people have been eroded, and the culture has been affected. In short, although international tourism has a certain economic and cultural advantage, it cannot be ignored that the difficulties are also increasing. The above are some of the problems that should be paid attention to. It can be seen that sustainable tourism development, in addition to considering the interests of the local population, should also pay attention to the protection of the natural environment.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.; I think that certain educational programs can enhance the learning process, but I fundamentally disagree with the idea that children should watch TV regularly at home and in school. The role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of television in the education of children. Children must do hands-on work, read and socialize with other people to develop their critical thinking and social skills. Programs made to teach children, such as documentaries and educational cartoons, can indeed provide valuable information and stimulate their curiosity. But the time spent in front of the screen can easily lead to passive consumption instead of active learning. Second, frequent use of the device leads to a number of negative outcomes. The excessive use of the device can lead to a number of health problems, such as obesity, insomnia and a lack of physical activity. Children are thus deprived of an important developmental aspect. In an environment where instant gratification is the rule, children can develop short attention spans and less interest in tasks that require more thinking. Third, the amount of entertainment programs available to children can make it difficult for them to focus on learning. Therefore, a balanced approach to learning is the best option, as it leads to healthier habits and more effective educational engagement. Books, discussions and creative projects are much more beneficial to children's development than watching TV.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.; One of the main advantages of working and studying from home is the freedom it provides. The development of the Internet has brought with it many advantages and disadvantages that it is necessary to take into account. However, one of the advantages is that the time wasted on the road is not wasted, but on the contrary, the costs of transportation are reduced, which positively affects the preservation of the environment. Another advantage is that people can plan their time in such a way that they will have time for their personal needs and they can do it without a trip. For students, this is especially an advantage for them, as it gives them the opportunity to do a lot of different, extra-curriculum activities and their personal projects. This, in turn, can have a positive effect on both employees in their jobs and students in their studies. In addition, people who work or study from home are often more productive, as they are able to arrange their home office according to their preferences, which can be a big advantage for people who have to work very long hours. On the other hand, the social isolation that can be experienced while working and studying from home can have a significant disadvantage. As a result, employees and students may miss the opportunity to socialize, cooperate and develop business relationships that a traditional environment brings. However, it is necessary to prevent this social isolation by arranging virtual communication and by establishing a fixed schedule, which will limit the disadvantages. In my opinion, although there are disadvantages to working and studying from home, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Accordingly, the future of working and studying from home is bright.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.; The growth of international tourism is a source of economic growth and employment in many countries. The growth of this industry on cultural exchanges is a source of great debate. Visitors often break local rules, which lead to tensions between tourists and locals. Those who argue that international tourism can lead to cultural tensions often point to the phenomenon of cultural commodification and appropriation. Conversely, proponents of tourism claim that tourism is a powerful tool for intercultural understanding, because tourists can experience other cultures firsthand, promoting empathy and challenging stereotypes. It can also be argued that the large number of tourists can put a strain on local communities, raising prices and altering local life, causing alienation. In conclusion, although international tourism can lead to cultural tensions, it also has the potential to foster intercultural understanding. As individuals from different backgrounds have common experiences, barriers between them are dissolved and mutual respect develops. I therefore believe that, with the right guidance and education, international tourism can have a positive impact on intercultural relations. The impact of tourism on intercultural relations depends largely on the attitude of tourists and local people. Encouraging responsible behavior and cultural sensitivity will reduce tensions and encourage greater intercultural understanding.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;" In today's society, the way we see celebrities has changed. Thanks to social media and the spread of reality shows, our attention is no longer focused on talent and diligence, but on glamor and wealth. We see the success of celebrities in the acquisition of material wealth, in their ability to satisfy the desire for luxurious life and in the satisfaction of the desire for public admiration. To a large extent, I agree that this phenomenon can be dangerous for young people. However, the main disadvantage of the obsession with glamor is that it excludes many deserving people who work in the background and whose achievements, although important for society, are rarely given the same importance as those related to wealth and glamor. This can lead to a false consciousness of young people who will value fame and popularity more than work and talent. But not all celebrities are the same; many are in the forefront to fight for social changes, to support charitable projects and to inspire younger people through their work. This disparity, in turn, can prevent young people from entering less glamorous but very important areas. And it is important for both society and the media to show examples of people who work diligently and contribute positively to society, and to inspire young people to reach for more than just a moment of glory. In conclusion, I agree that the current obsession with wealth and glamor among celebrities is a bad example for young people. It is important for young people to distinguish between those who value positive values and those who spread a culture of mediocrity."
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.; In recent years, the debate on the role of television in children's education has received a lot of attention. Although some argue that watching television is not beneficial to children's learning and development, I believe that, if used correctly, television is a valuable educational tool and should be encouraged in both home and school. This is because children are curious about the world around them and these programmes help to stimulate their natural curiosity. In addition, many of these programmes are entertaining and can help children to learn important things, such as language, mathematics, social skills and cultural awareness. In this way, they complement the teaching of the school and encourage a love of learning. And the information that children learn from the programmes not only enriches their general knowledge but also helps them to understand the world around them, so they are better informed and more able to understand the world issues in the future. In addition, by establishing limits and facilitating discussions, adults can turn passive viewing into an active, reflective process. However, in my view, it is important to encourage children to think carefully about what they watch, and parents and teachers should help children to select the appropriate program to watch, with a clear emphasis on education and positive values. Hence, I agree that children should be encouraged to watch TV, but this must be done carefully. In conclusion, although passive viewing and excessive screen time are real problems, educational television has a great potential to help children learn.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.; It is important to begin with the great experience that the older generation brings to the table. It is also true that young people are often more familiar with the latest developments in technology, but to say that older people are inherently less adaptable to change is not true. For example, many older workers have adopted new working methods and technology, which proves that they are capable of adapting. Their resilience and adaptability, developed over decades, often means that they can easily adopt new ideas and be creative when it comes to changes. The old employees are also often good mentors and provide good knowledge and practical skills that enrich the entire team. Moreover, age diversity is a very important asset in the workplace. Multi-generational teams can often benefit from the mixture of ideas and strategies that multiple generations bring to the table. It is also important to be aware of the potential biases that affect the workplace. By valuing age diversity, companies can encourage creativity and problem solving that taps into the strengths of all employees, regardless of age. However, it is not necessarily true that the youngest people are the most responsive and flexible employees. Therefore, by valuing all employees regardless of age, the company can benefit from greater flexibility and success. It is therefore important to emphasize the value that older employees can bring to the modern workplace rather than to favor the young because of their flexibility. To make the selection of a person based on age rather than on competence can have a negative impact on innovation and growth.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.; or vice versa? Today, automation and robotization are taking over more and more human work in industries and homes. The benefits of machines and automation are enormous. They have revolutionized the industry by making the process of production faster, more accurate, and in some cases cheaper. At the end of the day, whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages depends on various factors. Machines can do dangerous work and therefore reduce work-related injuries and accidents and improve the work environment for human workers. Machines are also capable of producing at a much higher rate, and this efficiency can not only satisfy the growing demands of consumers but also put human resources towards more complex tasks that require creativity and critical thinking. As machines continue to develop, they may be able to perform more human work and as a result, this may lead to a reduction in the work force, especially for those with less education and training, a situation that could lead to a decrease in productivity and economic instability. The main disadvantage is unemployment. If this technological shift is to be responsible, it is important for the society to find a balance between innovation and human skills. Machines can also take over certain manual labor, and this may lead to a loss of valuable human skills and craftsmanship. So, whether the advantages of automation outweigh the disadvantages or not is a matter of degree and it should be carefully considered.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.; This task is difficult. I agree that modern technology has its advantages, but I also believe that it is not completely pointless to preserve traditional skills and ways of life. This trend can lead to the extinction of customs, and the homogenization of culture, the change of unique traditions into standardized practices associated with industrial mass production. First, technological development can lead to the fact that human abilities are often replaced by machines. For example, with the advent of industrial farming, there is no longer a need for a farmer's knowledge of land and the loss of knowledge of sustainable practices. Secondly, many of these skills are associated with the history, values and identity of a certain region, they are associated with the country, they give a sense of belonging. Thirdly, there is no recognition of the value of traditions. Fourthly, a revival of interest in handicrafts and organic farming has taken place in recent years, which shows that the preservation of these traditions is not useless. We must not regard these abilities as useless, but as an important part of our social and cultural heritage, which should be preserved and developed alongside modern technology. The combination of technological progress and preservation of traditions enriches the society, diversifies it and strengthens the ties of community.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.; I agree that reducing the need to travel can help to reduce the level of traffic, but I do not think that it is the only solution. To combat congestion in cities, a combination of measures is needed. The first is the rise in remote work. When many companies took the COVID-19 pandemic into account, they changed the time when their employees came to work. This reduced the number of travelers during the rush hour. School and university students who choose hybrid or fully online classes significantly reduce the daily commute. The same thing happens with shopping and e-commerce. Both can eliminate the need to travel for the needs of the people. Cities must also improve public transport, making it more efficient, reliable and attractive to travelers. The same goes for investing in other transport modes, such as bicycle and pedestrian paths. But reducing the need to travel is not enough, cities must also work to improve public transport, making it more efficient, comfortable and attractive to travelers. In addition, an integrated approach to city planning and design is needed to achieve livable and sustainable cities. In conclusion, I agree that reducing the need to travel is a good strategy to combat congestion in cities, but I also agree that improving public transport and improving urban design is also needed to reduce congestion.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.; This is an increasingly influential phenomenon, especially among young people. There are celebrities who are popular for their talent and hard work, but there are also those who are popular for their glamorous lives and huge fortunes. Is it dangerous for young people to take them as examples? Some people think that when celebrities are able to create and earn money, it motivates young people to work hard for themselves. For example, when the entrepreneurs Rihanna and Jay-Z, who have an artistic background, start their own business, it is an example of how to achieve success with passion and perseverance. Young people can learn to make money. This does not prevent young people from working hard. However, the way they portray the life of celebrities teaches them to focus on the appearance and wealth of others. This may make young people more inclined to take care of themselves. The celebrities are able to inspire and motivate young people, but the focus on luxury and wealth makes young people set unhealthy goals. Young people should recognize the difference between real achievements and superficial success, and learn to seek a role model with integrity, persistence, and achievement. The omnipresent scrutiny and continuous work to maintain their status often affect their mental health, suggesting that the path to becoming a celebrity is not as easy as they portray it. However, we can admire the person and still understand their complexities.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.; To some extent, the proposal that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject raises significant questions about fairness, meritocracy and the structure of academic disciplines. The issue of gender equality in higher education, especially in the admission to universities, has been a subject of intense debate for some time. By introducing equality in the subject matter, the university would create a more diverse and balanced environment that would promote diversity of thought and opinion, which would benefit creativity, problem-solving and general academic performance. In the past, many academic disciplines have been predominantly male, especially the so-called STEM subjects, such as engineering, physics, chemistry and mathematics, while others, such as the humanities and social sciences, have attracted more women. To introduce gender equality into higher education, the institution could, inadvertently, accept unqualified students in the place of more qualified applicants simply because of their gender, thus undermining academic standards. On the other hand, the introduction of rigid gender quotas would lead to a denial of the individual's choice of subject and of course would not serve the interests of the individual, but rather the interests of the institution. It is therefore important that universities do not attempt to achieve gender equality in the subject matter through the introduction of quotas, but through the introduction of measures that encourage equality. Such measures, such as educational campaigns to attract underrepresented groups to particular subjects, mentorships and scholarships, could promote equality without compromising academic standards. In addition, individuals should be free to choose their field of study according to their personal interests and abilities, rather than by social expectations of gender equality. There should be a welcome for all students to pursue their own interests and skills, and in the end, the university must be a place where each individual can thrive based on their own abilities and interests.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.; I firmly believe that all countries should make rules about smoking in public places. Here are my reasons. Smoking is one of the most common causes of death. The World Health Organization says that secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 harmful chemicals. The organization also states that there is no safe level of exposure. Smoking is harmful not only to the smoker himself, but also to those around him. So, by creating a smoke-free public space, governments encourage people to think about stopping smoking or never start smoking at all. Secondly, these laws help to make society healthier. Protecting children, the elderly and people with pre-existing health conditions from involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke is a matter of public health. Thirdly, the implementation of smoking bans in public places reduces the cost of the health care system. There is evidence from countries with a strict smoking ban, such as Ireland and Australia, that smoking has declined after the introduction of comprehensive smoking bans. There is a rippling effect: the less visible the smoking is in public places, the less common the smoking becomes, and in the long run the percentage of smokers decreases. In my opinion, the overwhelming evidence of the harmful effects of smoking and its social consequences can be used to introduce a smoking ban in all countries. By doing so, governments can reduce the costs of health care and reallocate resources to more critical areas of public health.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.; Supporters of this view claim that the priorities of tourism distort the economy of a country to favor foreign investment over the interests of local people. The assertion that tourism is a modern form of colonialism is based on the observation that it sometimes exploits resources and local communities in a way that resembles the activities of the colonial period, although in a more modern context. The focus on tourism leads to the inflated prices of basic products and services, which often exclude local people and force them to abandon their traditional sources of income. In many tourist areas, most of the profits from tourism go to foreign companies and leave the local population in a difficult economic situation. According to other observers, the pressure of mass tourism often causes destruction of natural resources, pollution and a reduction in natural areas. The growing importance of mass tourism also has an unquestionable impact on the environment. And yet, it is also important to note that tourism can also bring positive changes, if it is managed properly. Sustainable tourism seeks to strengthen local communities, protect cultural assets and preserve the environment. In this respect, it resembles the activities of colonialism, which sucked up the natural resources of the country without thinking about their sustainability and the well-being of the population. There is a need to focus on a sustainable model of tourism that does not exploit local communities, but develops their resources and protects their cultural heritage. It is important to find a balance between economic benefits and the preservation of cultural heritage, in order to change the way tourism functions from colonialism into a mutually beneficial and respectful form of development. In the end, although it is important to focus on the damaging consequences of mass tourism, which resemble colonialism, it is also important to consider the possibility of a sustainable model of tourism, which supports the development of local communities.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.; We know that IT has changed the way we live and work. The Internet and e-mail have made it possible to connect to the world, which can be beneficial to all. The world has become smaller through communication, e-learning and work together. E-commerce has also contributed to new job opportunities and economic growth. On the one hand, it can be argued that IT has had great benefits for everyone. However, as we look forward, some concerns may indicate that further development in IT can lead to undesirable consequences. One significant issue is the loss of privacy. As technology develops, the collection of personal data increases and the potential for misuse by private companies and governments is increased. In addition, the emergence of artificial intelligence and automation could exacerbate economic inequality. High-profile data breaches and the monitoring scandal have also raised concerns about the freedom of people and the ability to consent. As technology becomes more and more a part of our lives, the potential for cyberbullying, addiction and the manipulation of information will increase and make it even harder for us to reconcile. Furthermore, the influence of social media on mental health and misinformation has been associated with increased tensions in society. In my opinion, the view that future developments in IT will have more negative effects than positive is to some extent valid, especially if we do not meet the upcoming challenges with thoughtful consideration. In short, the development of IT in the last twenty years has largely been positive, but further development of IT in the future can have major consequences. It is therefore important to reconcile innovation and ethical considerations in order to make technology serve us instead of harm us.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.; , one reason is that they are interested in health. Although the ethics of animals are undoubtedly a very important reason for the increasing popularity of vegetarianism, there are also many other reasons. Furthermore, the importance of preserving the environment also plays an important role. Many people are becoming aware of the negative health effects of eating too much meat, such as heart disease, obesity and certain types of cancer. It is a well-known fact that a balanced vegetarian diet can result in lower blood pressure, lower blood fat and less heart disease. In this way, they voluntarily make dietary changes in pursuit of health. According to various studies, it has been shown that the production of vegetarian food requires fewer resources than meat production, which is a more sustainable choice for those who are concerned about the future of the planet. Since the meat industry is the main cause of eutrophication, greenhouse gas emissions and water shortages, many people are also interested in reducing their own carbon footprint. Moreover, the number of vegetarian and plant-based products is increasing, making it easier and more convenient for people to make dietary changes. Restaurants and food shops now offer a wide variety of meatless choices, which makes it easier for vegetarianism to thrive. Besides, there are also many cultural and social factors that encourage this trend. And with the development of globalization, the different flavors of various cuisines are also more widely appreciated, resulting in a new generation of people willing to try new kinds of food. In conclusion, although the ethical considerations of animal rights are still important, health benefits, sustainable development and cultural influences also play an important role in the increase in the number of people who adopt vegetarianism. This is part of the trend towards more conscious living and more responsible consumption in today's society.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.; For the one thing, technological development can improve the quality of life and lead to economic growth. For the other, though it is true that modernization often kills certain customs, it is not useless to try to keep them alive. There are many ways to keep a person's customs alive. For example, the introduction of automation into farming makes it possible to produce more food with less labor, but it also makes it difficult for the people who do the old work of planting, harvesting and so on to survive. For the same reason, many of these customs and customs that have been passed down from generation to generation have the same value as their ancestors and the customs that are different from the country are forgotten. Then, the country adopts a uniform technology and life style and becomes homogenized, but the country itself is unique and can not be replaced by other countries. By preserving customs and skills, it can bring people together, giving them a feeling of belonging and pride. Conversely, people say that keeping such skills alive can hinder progress and innovation. For the time being, I think that although technological development is inevitable for the progress of a country, it is useless to try to keep such customs alive. There are many examples of communities that have successfully integrated modern technology with old customs and stayed prosperous while keeping their roots. If we see them as being incompatible, we can try to achieve a balance between them. If you want to preserve the old ways of life, it enriches the community, it creates opportunities for the future and it can give a sense of identity in an ever-changing world.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty."; It has long been argued that capital punishment is necessary for social order and crime reduction, but a closer look shows that the relationship between capital punishment and crime control is more complicated. It is simple enough to believe that if the punishment is severe and final, people will not take actions that could lead to their own execution. On the one hand, the supporters of capital punishment claim that the fear of execution can deter people from committing heinous acts, especially murder. On the other hand, a number of studies show that the relationship between the death penalty and crime control is not so simple and the countries that have abolished the death penalty have not had a significant increase in crime. For example, the crime rate in Canada and most European countries has been falling for years despite the absence of the death penalty. Also, the ethical problem of capital punishment is the possibility of erroneous attributions and the uneven impact of crime on disadvantaged groups. This suggests that other factors, such as education, social justice and the effectiveness of law enforcement, are more important for public security. Thus, I do not think that capital punishment is essential to control violence and that a reform of the judicial system could lead to a more humane and effective result. In conclusion, capital punishment is used for the purpose of preventing crime and ensuring public security, but it is less effective and more morally problematic. It is much more important to focus on rehabilitation, prevention and community support to find ways to prevent violence and create a more peaceful society.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.; In this case I disagree with this statement, because I believe that zoos serve several useful purposes, contributing both to the education and conservation of animals. First of all, zoos play an important role in educating people about animals and their habitats. Zoos create an ideal opportunity for people, especially children, to learn about the different species and the environment in which they live. It is an opportunity for many people to learn about animals and their natural environment. There are many species of animals that are now threatened due to habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change. Many zoos are involved in education programs that teach children about the importance of species conservation and the dangers facing the threatened animals. Zoos are also involved in breeding endangered species to help preserve the population of animals. The Californian condor, which was once extinct, has now been rescued and reintroduced into the wild. Zoos are therefore useful in today's society. In summary, although there are many criticisms of zoos that put entertainment before education and conservation, the purpose of zoos is still significant.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages."; They say that each language has its own unique cultural values, historical context and knowledge that make up the richness of human civilization. It is argued that if a language disappears, it is like losing a whole way of thinking and erasing a whole identity. They say that if these languages are supported, the ties between communities will be strengthened and more people will be made aware of diversity. For example, many indigenous languages still contain a lot of traditional knowledge and practices that are useful for both local communities and society as a whole. They also say that languages evolve over time, and as societies change, some languages will disappear without any help from us. Finally, they say that the public purse is limited, and that the state should spend more on education, health and transport. It is argued that it is illogical to take the money that should be spent on the languages that only a few people speak to use it for the language of a handful of people when more urgent social issues are needed. They say that if a language is endangered, it is not just a means of communication, but a heritage of culture and diversity. It is possible to use the public budget to support both language preservation and basic social needs. In my opinion, while the issue of budget is important, the importance of cultural preservation is also. Thus, I agree that governments should support endangered languages as part of their general commitment to cultural conservation. By promoting linguistic diversity, we enrich our society with the linguistic wealth of different cultures.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance."; I strongly agree with this statement. First, education on health issues will help people make better decisions. Thirdly, preventive measures such as vaccinations and regular screenings can prevent the occurrence of diseases and thus reduce the cost of treating them. A well-informed population can better prevent diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity, which are often related to poor lifestyle choices, such as unhealthy diets, lack of exercise and excessive drinking. Finally, such a shift in priorities from treatment to prevention can provide governments with significant long-term savings. For example, increasing spending on vaccinations can reduce the number of infectious diseases, which, in turn, will reduce the number of hospitalizations and, consequently, health spending. The World Health Organization recommends promoting health education and prevention of diseases. In conclusion, prioritizing health education and preventive measures is not only a wiser way to allocate health spending, but it is also a necessary condition for a healthy society. Although initial investment in education and prevention is quite significant, the reduction in treatment costs can lead to significant savings, which can be redirected to other areas of health spending or other areas of the economy that need support. Finally, through these measures, governments can ensure the health of their citizens and, in doing so, increase the quality of their life.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.; This subject has been in the public eye for some time. There are some good arguments for restricting university admissions to the best academic students. However, I believe that university education should not be restricted only to the very best, but made available to a broader group of young people for several reasons. And this is because many young people with the skills and abilities that have been cultivated outside the normal framework of school, school and university, are capable of producing new and useful knowledge and creative insights that are necessary for a constantly changing and advancing society. The principle of equality should be the foundation of university education. Many of the most successful entrepreneurs and inventors have not been the best in school, but have had to overcome obstacles. On the other hand, universities are also places for personal development, critical thinking and social development. In addition, the labor market is increasingly looking for practical experience and social skills in addition to academic qualifications, and a more varied and broader admission to university can benefit the students in developing these skills. In short, while academic skills and excellence should be considered when considering university admission, the opportunity to study at university should be regarded as a journey for everyone, and the goal of educating people from different backgrounds and abilities for the complexities of the modern world. Programs tailored to the different skills, such as apprenticeships and training, should be available for students who do not necessarily fit into the academic world.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.; The argument must be explored with regard to the advantages and disadvantages of the parental instruction. Firstly, parents are responsible for teaching the basic life skills. The lessons learned at home often build the character of the children, values and beliefs. For example, they teach kindness and respect, which later develops into responsible citizenship. But in this area, they may lack the training and knowledge that the teacher has. Furthermore, parents have a strong emotional connection with their children, and this, in turn, helps to motivate and build self-esteem. In addition, other people's teachers and teachers outside the home bring different views and ideas that can enrich the child's learning experience. For example, the parent is not capable of teaching higher mathematics and scientific theories effectively, which are necessary for academic success. Parents provide a solid foundation for learning and character development, but the best teachers are the people who educate and educate them. In conclusion, although parents are the first and foremost teachers of their children, they are still the main teachers in a wide variety of other subjects that are important for learning and for life.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.; On the one hand, a competitive salary ensures stability and security, allowing people to support themselves and their families and meet their personal financial goals. When choosing a job, many people pay a lot of attention to the salary. In fact, it is important to recognize that salary is not the only, let alone the most important, determining factor for everyone in terms of job satisfaction and career satisfaction. For many people, however, the financial side of the job is the main consideration, especially for those who have to support their children's education and repay their debts. The higher the salary, the less pressure on the family, the better the quality of life. Those who work in the field of creativity and those who have a passion for social work often put the environment and personal values in their careers before the salary, and a high-paying job with a lot of pressure and few good things in place are often driven to burn out. Other factors, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, opportunities for career advancement, and work culture, also play an important role in determining long-term engagement and happiness. For all these reasons, while salary is still an important consideration when choosing a job, it should not overshadow the other essential elements of a satisfying career. The importance of salary also varies with the stage and circumstances of the employee. A fresh graduate is likely to focus more on salary, while an experienced worker is more likely to pay attention to job satisfaction or environment than salary. Most importantly, in order to ensure long-term career happiness, we must take a comprehensive and balanced approach.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.; To a significant extent I support the principle of increasing the taxation of fossil fuels, especially those used in transport. Firstly, it would benefit the environment. The issue of increasing the taxation of petrol and diesel fuels in order to discourage the use of private cars brings to the forefront the clash between the environment, economic considerations and social justice. With higher taxes governments encourage people to use public transport, bicycles or their own two feet, which in turn reduces carbon dioxide emissions and contributes to the achievement of the goals of the international climate convention. Burning fossil fuels in transportation is the main source of the greenhouse effect, which intensifies the climate change and leads to more disastrous ecological consequences. With less reliance on private cars, fewer cars on the road, the chances of decreasing congestion and the number of cars on the road also increases. Secondly, increased tax revenues would enable governments to develop sustainable infrastructures. This means that by investing in public transport, cycle paths and pedestrian-friendly city planning they will enable people to have more viable alternatives to private cars, which means they will be able to choose public transport as a real alternative to car travel. The third reason is that a significant increase in the tax on cars without compensating measures may have a negative effect on poorer households. Many people, especially in rural and remote areas where public transport is insufficient, rely on their private cars to travel to work and back. To sum up, while taxation on petrol and diesel can play a key role in reducing the negative environmental effects of private car use, it must be implemented carefully to balance the needs of the environment with the interests of social justice. Such a policy must also include a range of measures, such as subsidising public transport, encouraging people to use electric vehicles and investing in cleaner transport alternatives. This kind of multi-layered approach would be most beneficial in promoting sustainable mobility.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.; I think it is reasonable to think that the presence of a gun increases the tension between the police and the civilian population and therefore increases the violence that may result from these confrontations. On the one hand, the presence of a gun may lead to a more violent confrontation between the police and the civilian population. But the opposite side of the coin is that firearms are a necessity for the police to effectively combat violence and protect the public. For example, incidents where police officers shot a civilian have led to widespread protests and demonstrations, indicating that the public often feel threatened rather than protected by the presence of armed police. Incidents of police violence are affected by several factors, including training, supervision, and community relations. The latter often leads to a decrease in police violence. In this way, instead of increasing the level of violence, police armed with guns would serve as a deterrent to the occurrence of crimes by ensuring that the police have the appropriate means to act in the face of dangerous situations. In conclusion, I believe that the presence of guns can lead to an increase in violence, but that the context of the society, police training, and community relations play a much greater role in whether the armed police serve as a threat or a protector. In particular, the level of trust between the police and the civilian population should be increased through transparency and accountability.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.; I completely agree with the statement that students learn more information with the help of technology and learn it more quickly. The Internet is an enormous source of information. In today's digital era, students have access to a large amount of information, much faster than before. One can study, for example, biology, and, besides reading the classic textbook, watch films, scientific articles, and interactive simulations that go beyond the scope of the textbook, so that he is given a much broader picture of the subject. With just a few clicks, one can easily access a huge number of online resources, including educational platforms such as Khan Academy, Coursera and YouTube, which give students the opportunity to go deeper into the subject and see it from different angles. Duolingo, for example, uses gamification to teach languages, and learners can go through the levels at their own pace, thus improving their memory and engagement. In addition, technology promotes a broader and more personal learning experience. For example, smart educational platforms such as Adapt and Duolingo are able to adapt to the learning style and speed of the student, as well as identify their weaknesses and strengths, and provide a better fit of educational materials. So the learner can better learn, and the use of instantaneous questions and answers on platforms such as Stack Exchange or on social media further enriches the learning process. Moreover, social media and collaborative tools facilitate the sharing of knowledge between peers. The students can easily form study groups and participate in discussions on educational platforms, thereby deepening their understanding through group work. In short, technology offers the learner the tools that are necessary for efficient learning in today's fast-paced world. As long as these developments are continued, the prospects for the education of the future are endless.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.; This essay was written in the summer of 2013. During the last hundred years, humanity has witnessed incredible technological advances that have changed people's lives, from medical breakthroughs to the advent of the Internet, the quality of life has been undoubtedly improved. However, the negative effects of such development can not be ignored. People have enjoyed an increased life expectancy, and the way of life has improved dramatically, but the increase in life expectancy has also led to the deterioration of the environment, and the increase in population has increased the competition for resources and led to more carbon emissions. Then, technology has also changed the way people communicate and work, leading to remote working and interconnectedness. Although this has facilitated interactivity and availability, it has also led to a blurring of the line between personal and professional life. The very technology that helps people live longer also makes them vulnerable to threats to their lives, such as climate change. Moreover, the speed of automation and the replacement of human workers by machines threatens to reduce employment and make people vulnerable. Due to the lack of sleep and indiscriminate connection, people's mental health has deteriorated, especially in younger generations. Then, unemployment and underemployment will lead to more social conflicts and greater disparity. In short, although technology has made great progress in improving people's lives, it is also necessary to take into account the negative effects of technology. This means that the benefits of technology must be tempered with awareness and the ability to address its shortcomings. Therefore, in order to maintain a sustainable future, we must be able to balance the benefits and drawbacks of technological progress.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy."; I strongly agree that there is a lot of violence in the programmes that should be reduced. The presence of violence in the programmes has sparked much debate about the effect of violence on the audience, especially children and young people. Studies have shown that children who see a lot of violence in the media are more prone to be aggressive themselves and may believe that violent behavior is an acceptable way to solve conflicts. Another concern about violent images is that the audience is numb to them. Besides the image that violence is sensational, the consequences of the violence are often not addressed. In this way, it can be perpetuated in a vicious circle of violence. Another aspect that requires consideration is the responsibility of the programme makers. By reducing violence in the programmes, the way is paved for a more nuanced storytelling, where the emphasis is on empathy, solution and moral dilemmas, and where the audience is challenged to solve complex issues instead of looking for simplistic solutions to conflict. In short, while television can be a means of entertainment and escape, the excessive violence on the screens requires critical reflection. The programme makers have great influence on the audience and especially young people. By choosing to limit violence, the programme makers can contribute to a more healthy media environment that promotes positive behavior and understanding among the audience. In the long run, it will be a benefit for the society as a whole. Reducing violent images will not only protect vulnerable audience groups but also contribute to the culture that empathy and constructive conflict resolution are preferred to violence.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.; Proponents of the view that armed police contribute to the violence in society often point to the possibility of confrontations and violence increasing. While it is understandable that the relationship between the arming of policemen and violence in society is not clear, and depends on the various factors of context, the armed police may indeed contribute to the violence in society, but the relationship is not a direct one. Firstly, in societies where policemen are seen as militarized, citizens react negatively, fearing for their safety and independence. Secondly, armed police create an environment of tension and fear, which may lead to violent incidents. Thirdly, properly trained and accountable armed policemen can respond to dangerous situations more effectively than unarmed ones, and in some critical situations they can prevent violence. However, it is important to remember that armed police are more effective in preventing crime and in ensuring public order. In countries where police training and accountability are better developed, the violence in society may decrease, but in those where police accountability and corruption are widespread, it may increase. The context of society affects the outcomes as well. The effectiveness of the armed police largely depends on the training and accountability of the policemen, as well as the broader social context. A multi-faceted approach to reduce and control violence should not be based only on arming the policemen. In conclusion, while it is understandable that the armed police may indeed increase the level of violence, the issue is complex and highly context-dependent.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school."; Despite the fact that peers play a crucial role during adolescence, in my view, parents remain the most important influence on a child's academic achievements. The question of whether peers have a more significant influence on a child's success in school than parents is a complex one. For example, a parent who encourages reading and encourages a child to engage in educational activities will help the child build a strong academic foundation. Firstly, parents are a child's first educators and role models. From the very earliest years, they instill in their children the values, habits and attitudes to learning. Parents also provide emotional and financial support that are crucial to the success of academic achievement. The most important thing is that a child has been taught a love of learning and a desire to learn. When faced with academic challenges, it is often the guidance of parents that children will follow rather than the influence of their peers. On the other hand, although peers can affect children's social skills and motivation, this effect is often mitigated by the involvement of parents. Parents who encourage their children to participate in extra-curricular activities, seek help when necessary and lead a balanced life will have a direct influence on their children's academic achievements. Although peers have an undeniable influence on a child's education, parents have the greatest influence on academic success. Children often look to their peers for recognition and acceptance, but this is often influenced by the confidence and values that have been instilled in them by their parents. Hence, in my opinion, it is impossible to deny the fact that a child's academic success depends to a large extent on the support and guidance of his or her parents.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.; On the one hand, big cities are associated with a variety of health risks. However, there are also compelling reasons to support this view. On the other hand, it is also worth considering the advantages that cities can bring to the health of people. But there are also more advantages than disadvantages in this sense. One disadvantage is that there are more dangerous toxic substances in the air in big cities due to the high level of industrial, traffic and construction activity. As a result, long-term exposure to these harmful substances can lead to chronic lung disease, heart disease and other serious illnesses. On the other hand, cities can also bring certain health benefits. In addition, due to the fast pace of life, the city is prone to the following unhealthy habits: bad diet, lack of exercise and no rest time, which can lead to long-term health damage. However, cities are also more conducive to people's physical and mental health. For example, the abundance of public transport and the city's pedestrian-friendly environment encourages people to exercise more, and enables residents to walk or ride bicycles more often than people in the countryside. There are also many medical resources in cities, such as gymnastics, health and mental health. Compared with small towns, the cities have more medical resources, such as hospitals, doctors, and therapists. Therefore, instead of completely agreeing that living in cities is bad for health, we should take a balanced and rational view of this issue. .
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.; On the one hand, it is argued that the mere presence of weapons can instigate tension in everyday life, because the presence of the weapon can cause people to feel threatened, which in turn creates an adversarial atmosphere rather than a trusting and co-operative one. The issue of armed police and the degree of violence in society is a very complex one. There are many instances of police using guns in the wrong way and of gunmen being shot dead by police officers. On the other hand, it is essential to consider the advantages of having armed police. Guns can be used to deter crimes of violence, thereby increasing public security. Many people would argue that police officers are trained professionals and they must be able to cope with difficult situations in order to protect themselves and the public. In places where violent crime is rife, officers armed with guns can deal more effectively with armed criminals, thus reducing the likelihood of a violent confrontation. Moreover, the presence of weapons in itself does not cause violence, but the underlying social circumstances, such as the degree of injustice and trust, play a crucial role. To conclude, while it is reasonable to be concerned about the level of violence in a society with armed police, it is too simplistic to suggest that armed police are the principal cause of that violence. There are countries where the police do not carry guns, but where there is still high level of violence because of the socio-economic and other problems, which are a result of unemployment and unemployment. Ultimately, it is necessary to promote a culture of accountability, training and close contact between the police and the public, which will reduce the level of violence, whether or not the police are armed.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.; For sure, education is the most important thing for a country. With knowledge and skills, it helps people to be able to participate in society and work, and this is the foundation of economic development, social justice, and political stability. The most direct impact of education on the development of a country is that education is the most important source of productivity and innovation, and an educated workforce is an important resource for technological progress and efficiency in various industries. Besides, education is an important factor in promoting social justice. For example, countries that have a high level of education, such as Finland and Japan, are always at the top of the world's economic rankings. It shows the power of education as a driving force for economic development and stability. People with higher levels of education have better jobs, and their living standards will rise and poverty will be alleviated, especially in developing countries. The fact that education is a powerful means of combating poverty and promoting social justice is especially true. Because education develops people's critical thinking skills, they will question social injustices, and they will become more responsible and active members of society. At the same time, education is also the foundation of political stability and civil participation. An informed and educated citizenry is more likely to take part in political activities and hold governments accountable. Therefore, I think education is the most important factor in the development of a country. Even though government, transportation, and natural resources are also important, education is the most important foundation for the development of a country.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously."; It is an undisputed fact that in the present society the concept of the celebrity has changed a lot. Nowadays, the world's leading figures are more famous for their luxury, wealth and way of life than for their real achievements and social contributions. This change of perception raises questions about the significance of such celebrities for young people. The reality stars, Internet celebrities, some singers and actors often become famous through sensationalism, and young people will often associate fame with wealth and not with their hard work and perseverance. In one way, it is clear that many celebrities are celebrated more for their luxury of life than for their talent and hard work. As young people are increasingly exposed to the Internet and are exposed to the public's role models, they may be attracted by superficial success. Moreover, the worship of wealth and glamor often fosters a materialistic culture and highlights the appearance of the material rather than the real character. Young people may be under the impression that they can easily achieve their dreams by a dazzling way of life and they may not recognize the value of hard work and perseverance. We must also be aware that not all celebrities are alike, and that many have used their platform to advocate for important issues, support and encourage good work, and promote the arts. This may lead to a generation that puts personal branding and social status above talent and real achievement. To encourage a broader view of success, it is necessary to encourage hard work, talent, and the need to contribute to society. In conclusion, although it is clear that many celebrities are celebrated for their wealth and glamor rather than for their achievements, it is dangerous for young people to pursue this kind of success. We must encourage them to associate fame with real achievement and useful social contributions. This kind of celebrity culture, which balances the achievement and success of the future generation, can be beneficial.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.; That argument is that cell phones have changed the way we communicate with each other. However, mobile phones are revolutionizing the way people interact. The relationship between family members in different countries is kept alive by communicating with each other on a daily basis. People who live far away from each other can see each other through the photographs, text messages and conversations. On the Internet, there are also groups and communities where people with the same interests meet each other. So they can also increase their social horizons. In addition, the technology that they use has created new relationships. Critics point to the phenomenon that people who are in a social environment and are busy with their phones. This reduces face-to-face contact. But this is not a feature of mobile phones, but the result of how people use the phone. This new social structure can also enrich people's lives and opportunities. Also, this technology, which allows for quick and easy communication, is very useful for socializing. In conclusion, while mobile phones sometimes disrupt personal communication, they are still an important social tool. It is possible to enjoy the advantages of mobile communication while remaining in the social environment. But instead of seeing the mobile phone as a hindrance to socialization, people should embrace it and take advantage of it.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.; It is important to understand that governments and large companies have the resources and power to resolve these problems. The daunting problems facing the world today, such as global warming and loss of biodiversity, are undeniable, and it is easy to think that such problems put the responsibility on governments and large companies. I argue that this view ignores the great influence of the individual. Large companies have the power to change their practices and introduce new, eco-friendly products and also to influence their consumers. Governing bodies such as governments have the power to create laws, regulations and policies that affect the large-scale industry and therefore also the environment. Individuals can act locally and change people's behavior, influence them and promote sustainable behavior. Such actions as clean-ups, local campaigns and local recycling efforts show that they can contribute to the solution of the problem. As more and more people create an awareness of the environment, more people are influenced by the government and large companies. When ordinary people act more consciously towards the environment, such as reducing waste and choosing sustainable companies, they create a powerful message that can influence business and government. In conclusion, governments and large companies have great influence on the environment, but ordinary people have the power to make changes. By acting together we can resolve these problems more effectively and sustainably. Responsibility should not be seen as a two-way street between people and institutions.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.; This kind of information is very important for society, but detailed description of crimes can also have a negative impact on it. The unrestrained coverage of crime in the press and on television is a controversial issue, with both views arguing for unrestrained reporting and restrictions. There is a danger that the emphasis on violent crimes and sensationalism leads to the belief that crimes are more common than they are, and that such a belief can lead to an increase in social anxiety and mistrust, and a loss of community life and personal participation. Because of the fear, people are also more prone to extreme measures and they are less likely to be involved in society. It is also argued that violent crimes, brutal crimes and their victims are desensitized by constant exposure to the public, which leads to a decrease in sympathy for the victims and to the emulation of violence, especially with impressionable youth who could consider criminal activities as permissible or even glamorous. In short, although the media perform an extremely important function in society, the consequences of detailed coverage of criminal events should be carefully considered. On the other hand, the role of the press as a watchdog and a source of information about social issues is also very important. A restriction of such information could endanger transparency and the ability to hold institutions and officials accountable. The tension between the right to know and the dangers of over-aggressive reporting could be solved by setting certain limits that would ensure responsible journalism and a safe community.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.; ? The necessity of teaching children handwriting skills is increasingly questioned in the modern era. Although technology has changed the way we communicate, I maintain that the teaching of handwriting is still necessary for several reasons. First, handwriting is an important part of the development of the brain. Learning to write develops fine motor skills, improves memory and increases creativity. These learning outcomes cannot be achieved through the use of the keyboard alone, which shows the importance of handwriting in education. Handwriting is also a vital social skill that can be useful both in personal relationships and in business when there is a need to express emotions and sensitivity. Secondly, handwriting communication creates a personal connection that digital correspondence often does not. In addition, handwriting skills in the context of exams and education are indispensable. Although digital communication is already dominating, the ability to write legibly and coherently by hand remains a necessary skill in many educational systems. Finally, the creative element of handwriting must not be neglected. The uniqueness of a person's handwriting contributes to his personality and this expression can also increase self-esteem and self-esteem. Hence, handwriting skills in education must be maintained for the development of the whole child. Not only does it serve practical purposes, but it also supports learning, socialization and personal expression.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in."; A. Public education is a fundamental right in democratic societies, which is funded through collective taxation to provide children of all backgrounds with basic learning opportunities. Secondly, public education is paid for through collective taxation, so it is possible to ensure that children from all social classes have access to the same learning opportunities. In conclusion, I do not support the notion that these families should be exempt from paying taxes to support public education. If families who choose private schools were exempt from paying taxes to support public schools, it would cause a reduction in the state's budget, putting an additional strain on a poorly funded school system and further widening the gap between the social classes. On the other hand, families who choose private schools continue to benefit from the social background that public education provides. As a result, all children benefit, despite the school they attend. However, the proponents of the tax claim that it is unfair to make private school families contribute to a system they do not use. A well-educated population supports the economy, the welfare system and democracy, which indirectly benefits all families, regardless of where they educate their children. Finally, the choice to educate their children in private schools is a personal choice that should not make families exempt from paying taxes to support public schools. There are alternative solutions such as vouchers or scholarships that make it possible for all families to benefit from public education without compromising the integrity of public funding. Although this solution may seem reasonable, it overlooks the broader societal consequences and the importance of maintaining a strong public education system for everyone. In addition, the benefits of a well-funded and accessible education system reach beyond the individual family and benefit the community and society as a whole.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.; For example, music and theatre play an important role in promoting people's health and well-being. However, dismissing the value of the arts ignores their great contribution to culture, economy and social cohesion. Investment in the arts can therefore be seen not just as a cost but as a preventive measure, which can reduce long-term medical costs. Participation in artistic activities, whether as an audience member or a participant, has been shown to reduce stress, fight depression and promote social cohesion. This is especially true in times of crisis, such as during the Covid 19 epidemic, when artistic performances helped people to relax and feel at home. But the arts also make a great contribution to the economy. Creative industries create jobs, attract tourists and support the local economy. The arts also contribute to the discussion of current social issues and therefore support civic engagement. A UK government study showed that for every pound the government invested in arts organisations, it received four pound in return, which shows that the support for the arts can have a variety of economic benefits that contribute to the government's income. For all these reasons, while investment in public services is important, government support for the arts is not a waste of money. On the contrary, the arts give a platform to marginalized voices and promote solidarity between different groups in society. Therefore, investment in the arts can strengthen social cohesion, which in turn strengthens the social fabric. Therefore, I believe that investment in the arts is not only justified but also necessary for the sustainable development of a society. Support for the arts and public services should be balanced in order to create a vibrant, resilient society.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.; It is true that technology is a powerful medium that can invade and weaken traditional cultures. However, I would like to say that this loss is not inevitable, and that it can be a powerful tool for the revitalization and preservation of traditional cultures. One of the most dangerous threats to traditional cultures is the globalization of dominant cultures. The broad use of social media and digital platforms promotes a homogeneous set of ideals, aesthetics and lifestyles that often eliminates traditional cultures. Younger generations who accept global trends often fear that they will lose their ancestral customs, languages and rituals. It is important to remember that digital archives and platforms can preserve and make available the language and customs that are being destroyed, and that virtual reality experiences and storytelling can give us the opportunity to meet and appreciate other cultures. And that we can learn to respect and understand them. For example, communities that have been excluded from the media can use them to share their stories and traditions, and thereby foster a renewed pride in their cultural heritage. Finally, technology can enable traditional cultures to make their stories and traditions available to the world, and this will create a new identity. In conclusion, it is my opinion that with active use of technology, it is possible to maintain the coexistence of modernity and tradition, and to promote the diversification of cultures in an increasingly interconnected world.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.; The debate on whether universities should accept equal numbers of men and women in all courses is a complex issue that involves issues of equality, merit and the demands of society. On the one hand, encouraging a level of gender equality in higher education could help dispel long-standing gender biases and stereotypes that have long excluded women from certain areas of study, such as engineering and information technology. The aim of achieving gender equality in education is commendable, but the approach of equal acceptance raises many problems. However, the question of merit still exists, and although it is unfair to say that the degree of discrimination between men and women is still significant in many careers, it is equally true that in some areas of study, such as mathematics and science, women are still under-represented. Ensuring equal numbers could also ensure a better balanced and fairer educational environment, thereby enhancing the chances of success. However, it is also true that the different interests and abilities of men and women with regard to certain subjects, such as the imbalance between the numbers of men and women applying to study engineering compared with nursing, would be a problem if universities were to adopt an equal number of men and women in every subject. The priority for admission should be on the qualifications, abilities and interest of the applicant rather than on the basis of his or her gender. Instead of enforcing an equal number of men and women in all courses, the number of women should be encouraged in all areas of study, thereby ensuring that both merit and equality are observed and that the educational standard is maintained. In conclusion, although it is desirable to promote gender equality in higher education, a more flexible approach must be adopted.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.; A Thesis statement - I mostly agree with this statement. Many people argue that the relentless exposure of celebrities to the media can have a negative influence on children. In particular, constant exposure to idealized images of celebrities can create an unachievable idea of beauty, success and lifestyle. This can lead to problems such as low self-esteem, poor body image and a distorted view of success, which is often associated with fame and wealth. Children are particularly vulnerable to this influence because they are often very impressionable and still forming their identities. Examples of celebrities engaging in risky behaviour such as drug abuse, public displays of affection or excessive materialism are plentiful. If these things are reported on in the media, they may come to seem normal and desirable to children. In addition, the content of the media is often glamourized and sensationalized, which encourages children to copy negative behaviour. In some cases, however, celebrities use their platforms for philanthropy and convey a positive message. In this case, children can learn from these role models. B It is important to mention that not all media coverage is detrimental. For example, some publications contain news about celebrities who have given money to charities or who have done something positive for their local communities. However, it is the dominant, negative media coverage that children are more likely to notice. C In conclusion, although celebrity culture offers children positive role models, the pervasiveness of negative media coverage can undermine their values and self-esteem. It is therefore essential that parents, teachers and the whole of society engage critically with the media and guide children to more positive content.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.; This opinion is in agreement with me strongly. The idea that prevention is better than cure, a well-known expression in the field of public health, implies that investing in education and preventive measures is a better alternative to attempting to treat diseases after they occur. Immunizations against rubella or influenza prevent endemics and thus save millions of treatment costs while enhancing public health. In particular, preventive measures such as vaccination, screening and public health education programs not only reduce the number of diseases, but also reduce the burden on health systems. Moreover, the education of individuals to be aware of healthy lifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, the dangers of smoking and alcohol, prevents the risk of developing chronic diseases. In this way, the risk of developing a chronic disease decreases, which in turn prevents more ill health and a greater burden on the health system. However, it is also important to point out that there will always be a need for treatment, because not all diseases can be prevented. So a balanced approach is needed. In my opinion, diverting a larger proportion of the health budget to health education and preventive measures is not only a sensible solution, but also a moral obligation. Funding for treatment may be given priority for acute illnesses and emergencies, but should not be allowed to replace preventive measures. Such a balanced approach can lead to long-term savings and better health for the population. The priority of preventive medicine can result in a healthier population and a more sustainable health system.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.; Societal custom has always placed the responsibility for parenting and child-rearing on mothers, which has not only undermined fathers’ role but also perpetuated unfavourable gender stereotypes. Emphasizing the importance of both parents is important for a balanced view of the family unit and for children to have a balanced view of family life. Fathers’ active participation in family planning and child-rearing is vital for children’s healthy development. First, parents should recognize that child-rearing is a shared responsibility. As a result of societal changes, more fathers have been involved in child-rearing and play an active role in their children’s early development. There is increasing evidence that positive father-child relationships are as important as mother-child relationships. Second, if fatherhood is emphasized, it will also be possible to break down the stigma against fathers who wish to take on primary responsibility for child-rearing. Third, by focusing on fatherhood, it will be possible to broaden the understanding of family structures. With many different family types now existing, all caretakers, be they fathers, mothers or other relatives, should be recognized as vital for a child’s healthy development. By questioning traditional gender roles, this will encourage a more equitable division of parenting responsibilities. And lastly, a broader understanding of the importance of both parents in a child’s development is important not only for the child’s healthy development but also for a society that recognizes and appreciates shared parenting. In conclusion, in order to promote a more balanced view of child-rearing, fatherhood must be emphasized as much as motherhood.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.; Firstly, education plays an important role in equipping children with the necessary knowledge and skills for future opportunities. However, to dismiss the value of sport means to ignore the needs of children in a broader sense. Such skills as teamwork, discipline, leadership and perseverance can be acquired through playing sport. Secondly, the importance of a solid academic foundation for later success in higher education and careers. The regular practice of physical activity helps to prevent childhood obesity and to instill lifelong habits of physical fitness. Thirdly, physical health is an important part of overall health. Besides, physical activity is an important avenue for emotional expression and stress relief. Finally, many studies show that children who participate in sport have improved concentration and memory, which will also benefit their academic work. Moreover, the combination of sport and academics can help children to develop well-rounded personalities that will prepare them not only for their future careers but also for life. In conclusion, while it is undeniable that schoolwork is important, it is not wise to disregard the importance of sport for children’s development. Instead of considering sport a distraction, we should see it as a necessary complement to academic learning.
