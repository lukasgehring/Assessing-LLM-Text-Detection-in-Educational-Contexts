0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The debate on whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that teaching children to compete is essential for their future success, I firmly believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in making them useful adults.Teaching children to co-operate helps them develop essential social skills such as communication,ing,ing, empathy, and problem-solving. When children work together towards a common goal, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, leading to a more harmonious and productive team. This, in turn, prepares them for the real world where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued. Moreover, co-operation fosters a sense of community and mutual respect, which is critical in building strong, lasting relationships.On the other hand, teaching children to compete can lead to an overly individualistic mindset, where they prioritize their own success over others. This can result in an unhealthy obsession with winning, leading to stress, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem when they encounter setbacks. Furthermore, an overemphasis on competition can create a cutthroat environment where children feel pressured to succeed at all costs, undermining the value of fair play and sportsmanship.In conclusion, while competition has its benefits, I believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial in the long run. By learning to work together, share ideas, and support one another, children will develop into more well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. As they navigate the complexities of the real world, they will be better equipped to build strong relationships, work effectively in teams, and contribute positively to their communities. Ultimately, teaching children to co-operate is essential in raising a generation of compassionate, collaborative, and successful individuals.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The notion that immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour in order to become integrated into society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that assimilation is essential for a seamless transition, the others contend that preserving one's cultural identity is equally important. In my opinion, I disagree with the idea that immigrants should completely abandon their old ways.On one hand, adapting to local customs and codes of behaviour can facilitate social integration and economic success. By embracing the norms and values of the adopted country, immigrants can build stronger relationships with the locals, find better job opportunities, and participate in the community more effectively. However, this should not come at the cost of sacrificing one's cultural heritage. Immigrants bring with them unique perspectives, traditions, and customs that can enrich the cultural diversity of the host country.On the other hand, abandoning one's cultural identity can lead to a loss of personal identity and a sense of disconnection from one's roots. Preserving cultural heritage can provide immigrants with a sense of belonging and continuity, which is essential for their mental and emotional well-being. Moreover, a multicultural society that values diversity is more likely to be inclusive and welcoming to immigrants, allowing them to contribute their skills, experiences, and perspectives to the host country.In conclusion, while adapting to local customs is important, it is equally essential for immigrants to preserve their cultural identity. A balanced approach that allows immigrants to integrate into the host society while maintaining their cultural heritage is the most desirable outcome. By embracing diversity and promoting inclusivity, host countries can create a welcoming environment that fosters social cohesion and economic prosperity for all.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The rise of international tourism has become a prevalent phenomenon in recent years. While some people view this trend as a positive development, others are more skeptical about its implications. In my opinion, international tourism has both beneficial and detrimental effects on the world.On the one hand, international tourism can have numerous positive impacts. It can foster cultural exchange and understanding between different nations, promoting global harmony and cooperation. Additionally, tourist influx can contribute significantly to the local economy, as visitors spend money on accommodations, food, and souvenirs. This can lead to job creation, infrastructure development, and improved living standards for the local population. For instance, many countries like Thailand, Spain, and Italy have witnessed significant economic growth due to tourism.On the other hand, uncontrolled tourism can lead to several negative consequences. Over-tourism can result in environmental degradation, as large numbers of visitors can strain local resources, pollute the air and water, and damage natural habitats. Moreover, the commercialization of tourist attractions can lead to the erosion of local cultures and traditions. For example, the city of Venice has faced significant challenges due to the large influx of tourists, which has put a strain on its infrastructure and altered the character of the city.In conclusion, while international tourism can have both positive and negative effects, I believe that it is essential to strike a balance between promoting tourism and preserving local cultures and environments. Governments, tourism boards, and local communities must work together to implement sustainable tourism practices, ensuring that the benefits of tourism are equitably distributed, and the negative impacts are mitigated. By doing so, we can promote a more responsible and beneficial form of international tourism.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The rise of international tourism has become a contentious issue, with some people hailing it as a positive development, while others lament its negative consequences. In my opinion, international tourism is a double-edged sword, bringing about both benefits and drawbacks.On the one hand, international tourism has numerous advantages. It promotes cultural exchange, allowing people from different countries to learn about and appreciate each other's customs, traditions, and ways of life. This cross-cultural understanding fosters global unity and cooperation, breaking down stereotypes and prejudices. Moreover, tourism generates significant revenue for local economies, creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. Many countries rely heavily on tourism as a major source of income, and it has helped to improve the standard of living for millions of people worldwide.On the other hand, international tourism also has its downsides. The influx of tourists can lead to overcrowding, pollution, and degradation of popular destinations, causing strain on local infrastructure and resources. The commercialization of tourism can also result in the erosion of traditional cultures, as local customs and practices are adapted to cater to tourist demands. Furthermore, the carbon footprint of international travel contributes to environmental problems, such as climate change and air pollution.In conclusion, while international tourism has its drawbacks, I believe that its benefits outweigh its costs. With responsible and sustainable tourism practices, the negative impacts can be mitigated, and the positive effects can be maximized. By promoting cultural sensitivity, awareness, and respect, tourists can contribute to the preservation of local cultures and environments, rather than harming them. Ultimately, international tourism has the potential to enrich our lives, broaden our perspectives, and foster global understanding, making it a trend that should be encouraged and nurtured.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The idea of pursuing higher education overseas has become increasingly appealing to many students worldwide. However, the statement suggests that staying home is a better option due to the challenges of living and studying in a foreign culture. In my opinion, I partially disagree with this statement.On the one hand, it is undeniable that studying abroad can pose significant difficulties, such as cultural shock, language barriers, and homesickness. Adapting to a new environment, making new friends, and navigating unfamiliar academic systems can be overwhelming. Moreover, the financial burden of living abroad can be substantial, and many students may struggle to make ends meet.On the other hand, I believe that the benefits of studying overseas far outweigh the drawbacks. For one, it provides students with a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in a new culture, broaden their perspectives, and develop valuable life skills such as independence, resilience, and adaptability. Additionally, studying abroad can enhance one's career prospects, as it demonstrates a willingness to take risks and challenge oneself. Many universities abroad also offer world-class education, cutting-edge research opportunities, and renowned faculty, which can be unbeatable in one's home country.Furthermore, with careful planning, research, and preparation, many of the difficulties associated with studying abroad can be mitigated. Many universities offer support services, such as language support, cultural orientation, and counseling, to help international students adjust to their new environment. In conclusion, while there are certainly challenges to studying overseas, I believe that the benefits of this experience make it an invaluable and rewarding opportunity for personal and academic growth. With proper preparation and a willingness to adapt, students can thrive in a foreign culture and reap the rewards of an international education.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;Studying abroad has become a popular trend among students in recent years. Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries for various reasons. One of the primary reasons is to gain access to high-quality education and academic opportunities that may not be available in their home country. For instance, some countries have top-ranked universities that offer specialized programs in fields such as engineering, business, or medicine, which may not be offered in the student's home country.Another reason students study abroad is to broaden their cultural and social horizons. By living and studying in a foreign country, students are exposed to new languages, customs, and ways of life. This helps them to develop valuable skills such as independence, adaptability, and communication, which are essential in today's globalized world. Additionally, studying abroad provides students with the opportunity to network with people from diverse backgrounds and make lifelong connections.Furthermore, studying abroad can also enhance career prospects. Employers often view international students as attractive candidates because they possess a unique set of skills and experiences that set them apart from others. International students are often seen as more adaptable, resilient, and open-minded, which are valuable assets in the modern workplace. Moreover, some countries offer better job opportunities and higher salaries than others, making studying abroad a strategic move for students who want to advance their careers.In conclusion, students choose to study abroad for a variety of reasons, including accessing high-quality education, broadening their cultural and social horizons, and enhancing their career prospects. By studying abroad, students can gain a competitive edge, develop valuable skills, and create lifelong connections that can benefit them throughout their lives. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the benefits of studying abroad are likely to continue to grow, making it an attractive option for students from around the world.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we consume information, leading to a significant shift in the way news is disseminated. With the rise in popularity of online news platforms, it is often argued that newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. While I acknowledge the impact of the internet on the newspaper industry, I only partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, the internet has made it possible for people to access news instantly, from anywhere in the world. Online news platforms are constantly updated, providing readers with the latest developments on current events. Additionally, the internet offers a wide range of news sources, allowing readers to access diverse perspectives and opinions. As a result, many people have turned to online news sources, leading to a decline in newspaper sales.On the other hand, I believe that newspapers will not become completely obsolete. Many people still value the tactile experience of reading a physical newspaper, and the in-depth analysis and commentary that newspapers often provide. Furthermore, newspapers often have a strong local focus, providing readers with news and information that is relevant to their community. This is something that online news platforms often struggle to replicate.In conclusion, while the rise of the internet has undoubtedly had an impact on the newspaper industry, I do not believe that newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. Instead, I think that newspapers will evolve to incorporate online elements, such as online editions and social media engagement. Ultimately, the future of newspapers will likely involve a combination of traditional and digital formats, allowing readers to access news in the way that suits them best.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The allocation of a government's budget is a crucial aspect of a country's development. When it comes to education, a significant dilemma arises: should the government prioritize the education of very young children or universities? In my opinion, focusing on very young children's education is essential for the successful development of a country.Early childhood education lays the foundation for a child's future academic success and overall development. Investing in young children's education can have a lasting impact on their cognitive, social, and emotional growth. Research has shown that high-quality early childhood education can lead to better academic performance, improved social skills, and increased earning potential in adulthood. Moreover, a strong foundation in early childhood education can help reduce the achievement gap and improve overall educational outcomes.In contrast, while universities are important for producing skilled and knowledgeable individuals, they already have a established foundation from their previous education. Focusing solely on universities may not address the root causes of educational disparities and may not have as significant of an impact on the overall development of a country. Furthermore, a well-educated population, starting from a young age, can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is essential for a country's economic, social, and political development.Therefore, I firmly believe that a government should focus its budget more on very young children's education rather than universities. By doing so, a country can ensure that its future generations are equipped with the necessary skills, knowledge, and values to drive development and prosperity. This investment will have long-term benefits, leading to a more educated, skilled, and competitive workforce, which is essential for a country's successful development.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";Living with roommates is a common experience for many students attending school or university. Having a good roommate can make a significant difference in one's academic and personal life. In my opinion, some of the most important qualities of a good roommate are respect, responsibility, and effective communication.Firstly, respect is a crucial quality of a good roommate. This means respecting each other's personal space, belongings, and study habits. For instance, a considerate roommate will not play loud music or host parties without consulting their roommates, allowing everyone to focus on their studies. Additionally, respecting each other's differences and opinions can help create a harmonious living environment.Secondly, responsibility is another vital quality of a good roommate. This includes taking care of shared spaces, such as the kitchen and bathroom, and contributing to household expenses. A responsible roommate will do their fair share of chores, such as cleaning and laundry, and pay their bills on time. This helps to maintain a clean and comfortable living space, and also reduces financial stress.Lastly, effective communication is essential for a positive roommate experience. This means being open and honest about one's needs, concerns, and expectations. For example, if a roommate is having a noisy gathering, they should inform their roommates in advance and come to a mutually agreeable solution. Good communication can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and help roommates to find common ground and resolve issues amicably.In conclusion, a good roommate should possess qualities such as respect, responsibility, and effective communication. These traits are essential for creating a positive and supportive living environment, which is conducive to academic success and personal well-being. By being considerate, reliable, and communicative, roommates can build a strong and harmonious relationship, making their shared living experience enjoyable and stress-free.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways. One of the primary reasons for this is that public transportation can significantly reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. By providing efficient and reliable public transportation options, people are more likely to leave their cars behind, resulting in fewer vehicles on the road and a decrease in harmful emissions.Additionally, investing in public transportation can have numerous economic benefits. It can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and increase access to employment and education opportunities. For instance, a well-developed subway system can connect suburbs to city centers, making it easier for people to commute to work or school. Furthermore, public transportation can also improve the quality of life for low-income individuals who may not have access to cars, providing them with a reliable and affordable means of transportation.In contrast, spending more money on improving roads and highways may only serve to accommodate the growing number of private vehicles on the road, exacerbating traffic congestion and air pollution. Moreover, the maintenance and construction of roads and highways are often more expensive and labor-intensive than developing public transportation systems. Therefore, it is more cost-effective and sustainable for governments to prioritize improving public transportation. By doing so, governments can create a more environmentally friendly, economically vibrant, and socially equitable transportation system that benefits all members of society. Ultimately, investing in public transportation is a forward-thinking approach that can have long-term benefits for the environment, economy, and community.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. While academic studies are crucial for a student's intellectual development, I think that physical activity is equally important for their overall well-being. Firstly, regular exercise has been proven to improve cognitive function and concentration, which can actually enhance academic performance. When students engage in physical activity, they are able to focus better in class and retain information more effectively.Moreover, incorporating physical exercise into the school day can help combat the rising obesity rates and sedentary lifestyles that many children are adopting. By making exercise a mandatory part of the school day, students will develop healthy habits from a young age, which can benefit them throughout their lives. Additionally, physical education classes provide a unique opportunity for students to develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and discipline, which are essential for their personal and professional growth.In contrast, spending the whole school day on academic studies can lead to burnout and decreased motivation among students. A balanced school day that includes both academic and physical activities can help maintain students' enthusiasm and interest in learning. Furthermore, physical exercise can also serve as a stress-reliever and mood-booster, which is particularly important for students who may be struggling with academic pressures or personal issues.In conclusion, I strongly agree that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. The benefits of regular physical activity, including improved academic performance, healthy habits, and essential life skills, make it an indispensable component of a student's daily routine. By incorporating physical exercise into the school day, we can raise well-rounded, healthy, and happy students who are equipped to succeed in all aspects of life.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The advent of technological innovations has revolutionized the way nations interact with each other in a global society. Apart from airplanes and telephones, another crucial innovation that has significantly impacted global interactions is the internet. The internet has become a vital tool for international communication, commerce, and cultural exchange.I choose the internet as a significant technological innovation because it has bridged geographical gaps and enabled instant connectivity between nations. The internet has facilitated global trade, allowing businesses to operate across borders and connect with customers worldwide. E-commerce platforms, as well as digital payment systems, have made it possible for people to shop and conduct financial transactions globally. Moreover, the internet has enabled the exchange of ideas, cultures, and values between nations, fostering global understanding and cooperation.The internet has also played a crucial role in facilitating international diplomacy and collaboration. Governments and international organizations can now communicate and negotiate with each other instantly, regardless of their geographical location. This has enabled swift responses to global challenges, such as natural disasters, economic crises, and pandemics. Furthermore, the internet has democratized access to information, allowing people to access knowledge and news from around the world, and enabling them to engage in global discussions and debates.In conclusion, the internet is a technological innovation that has transformed the way nations interact with each other in a global society. Its impact on global commerce, cultural exchange, diplomacy, and access to information has been profound. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the internet will continue to play a vital role in shaping global relationships and fostering international cooperation.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The statement that technology has made children less creative than they were in the past is a topic of debate among educators and parents. While some argue that technology has stifled children's creativity, I disagree with this notion. In fact, I believe that technology has opened up new avenues for children to express their creativity.On one hand, it is true that excessive screen time and exposure to technology can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and a decrease in imaginative play. Children who spend most of their time playing video games or watching TV may have limited opportunities to engage in creative activities such as drawing, painting, or building with blocks. However, this is not a direct result of technology itself, but rather how it is used.On the other hand, technology has provided children with a wide range of tools and resources that can foster creativity. For example, digital art software and apps allow children to create and manipulate images, videos, and music. Additionally, online platforms and communities provide children with opportunities to share their work, receive feedback, and collaborate with others. Technology has also made it possible for children to access a vast amount of information and resources, which can inspire and inform their creative pursuits.Furthermore, technology has enabled children to engage in creative activities that may not have been possible in the past, such as 3D modeling, animation, and coding. These activities require children to think critically and creatively, and can help develop problem-solving skills and self-expression. In conclusion, while technology can be used in ways that limit creativity, I believe that it has the potential to enhance and expand children's creative possibilities. By using technology in a balanced and intentional way, children can develop their creative skills and express themselves in new and innovative ways.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The notion that students learn more from lessons with teachers than from other sources has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that traditional classroom instruction is the most effective way to learn, others claim that alternative sources, such as the internet and television, can provide equally valuable, if not more, educational experiences. In my opinion, I partially disagree with the statement.On the one hand, traditional lessons with teachers offer a unique learning environment that fosters engagement, interaction, and immediate feedback. Teachers can tailor their instruction to meet the individual needs of their students, providing a more personalized and effective learning experience. Moreover, teachers can help students develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication, which are crucial for academic and professional success.On the other hand, alternative sources like the internet and television have become increasingly sophisticated and accessible, offering a vast array of educational resources. The internet, for instance, provides an unparalleled wealth of information, allowing students to explore topics in-depth and at their own pace. Additionally, online courses, educational videos, and podcasts have made it possible for students to learn from renowned experts and educators worldwide. Television, too, offers a range of educational programs that can spark curiosity and interest in various subjects.In conclusion, while traditional lessons with teachers are invaluable, I believe that alternative sources can complement and enhance the learning experience. Students can learn a great deal from both traditional instruction and alternative sources, and the most effective approach is likely a combination of both. By leveraging the strengths of each, students can gain a more comprehensive and engaging education that prepares them for success in the 21st century.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;"The advent of email and text messaging has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we communicate, transforming the speed and convenience of exchanging information. However, the notion that these technologies are seriously threatening the status of written language is a topic of debate. While I acknowledge that there are some negative impacts on written language, I only partially agree with this statement.On one hand, email and text messaging have led to a decline in formal writing skills, as people increasingly rely on brief, informal messages. The brevity and spontaneity of digital communication often result in a lack of attention to grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Furthermore, the prevalence of abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons can undermine the richness and nuance of written language. For instance, the overuse of abbreviations like ""btw"" and ""tbh"" can diminish the ability to articulate complex ideas and express subtle emotions.On the other hand, email and text messaging have also opened up new avenues for written communication, making it possible for people to connect with others across geographical boundaries. Moreover, digital platforms have democratized writing, enabling people to express themselves and share their thoughts with a wider audience. Blogging, online journalism, and social media have created new opportunities for people to engage in written communication, fostering a culture of literacy and self-expression.In conclusion, while email and text messaging pose some threats to the status of written language, I believe that their impact is not entirely negative. By striking a balance between the convenience of digital communication and the importance of formal writing skills, we can harness the benefits of these technologies while preserving the integrity of written language. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to adapt to the changing landscape of communication, using email and text messaging as tools to enhance, rather than undermine, the art of written expression."
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The debate over whether it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of human beings has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that exploiting animals for human purposes is justifiable, I firmly believe that it is wrong to do so.On one hand, the use of animals in medical research, transportation, and food production has undoubtedly contributed to human progress and well-being. For instance, animals have been used in medical experiments to develop life-saving vaccines and treatments. However, I believe that these benefits do not outweigh the suffering and harm inflicted upon animals.On the other hand, animals are sentient beings with feelings, needs, and rights. They have the capacity to experience pain, fear, and joy, just like humans do. Exploiting them for human purposes is a form of oppression, which undermines their inherent dignity and autonomy. Furthermore, with advancements in technology and science, there are often alternative methods and solutions that can replace the need for animal exploitation.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the benefits that humans have gained from using animals, I strongly believe that it is wrong to exploit them for human purposes. Animals are not commodities or tools for human gain, but rather living beings that deserve our respect, compassion, and protection. As a society, we should strive to promote animal welfare and adopt more humane and sustainable practices that prioritize their well-being and dignity. By doing so, we can work towards a more ethical and just world for all beings.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;"The statement that ""Television has destroyed communication among friends and family"" is a topic of debate among many. While some argue that television has indeed led to a decline in interpersonal communication, I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, television has not destroyed communication, but rather, it has evolved the way people interact with each other.On the one hand, it is true that excessive television watching can lead to a decrease in face-to-face interaction. For instance, a family spending hours watching TV together may not engage in conversations or share their thoughts and feelings. However, this is not a universal truth and it depends on how television is used. Many families use television as a tool to bond over their favorite shows, discussing the plot and characters, thus enhancing their communication.On the other hand, television has also provided new platforms for people to communicate. With the rise of social media and online streaming, friends and family can now discuss their favorite shows and share recommendations with each other, even if they are not in the same physical location. Moreover, television shows often tackle complex social issues, sparking important conversations and debates among viewers. For example, shows like ""This Is Us"" have been praised for addressing sensitive topics such as mental health, racism, and trauma, encouraging viewers to discuss and share their own experiences.In conclusion, while it is true that excessive television watching can lead to a decline in face-to-face interaction, it is not accurate to say that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Television, like any other medium, is a tool and its impact depends on how it is used. When used moderately and thoughtfully, television can actually enhance communication and provide new platforms for people to connect and share ideas."
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The notion that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked intense debate. While achieving gender parity is crucial for promoting equality, some argue that enforcing equal numbers may not be the most effective approach. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, accepting equal numbers of male and female students can help bridge the existing gender gap in certain subjects, particularly in fields such as engineering and computer science, where women are underrepresented. By doing so, universities can provide more opportunities for women to pursue careers in these areas, thereby promoting diversity and challenging stereotypes. Additionally, this approach can also encourage men to take up subjects traditionally dominated by women, such as nursing and education, thereby fostering a more balanced and inclusive learning environment.On the other hand, enforcing equal numbers may lead to less qualified candidates being accepted, potentially compromising the academic standards of the institution. Universities should prioritize merit-based admissions, where students are selected based on their academic abilities and potential, rather than their gender. Furthermore, some subjects may naturally attract more students of one gender than the other, and attempting to artificially balance the numbers could be counterproductive.In conclusion, while the idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students has its merits, it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Universities should strive to create an environment that encourages and supports students of all genders to pursue their academic interests, but ultimately, admissions should be based on individual merit and potential. A more nuanced approach, which takes into account the specific needs and requirements of each subject, is likely to be more effective in promoting gender equality and academic excellence.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The question of whether young adults should seek independence from their parents as soon as possible or live with their families for a longer time is a complex one. In my opinion, I believe that living with families for a longer time is a more beneficial situation. On the one hand, living with parents can provide young adults with financial stability and security. By not having to worry about paying rent or bills, they can focus on their studies or careers without added stress. Additionally, living with family can also provide emotional support and guidance, which is essential for young adults who are navigating the challenges of adulthood. On the other hand, seeking independence too early can lead to unnecessary struggles and hardships. Many young adults are not equipped with the necessary life skills to live on their own, such as budgeting, cooking, and time management. By living with their families, they can learn these essential skills in a supportive environment. Moreover, cultural and societal factors also play a significant role in this decision. In many cultures, living with family is seen as a sign of respect and responsibility, rather than a lack of independence. It is also worth noting that the cost of living is increasing rapidly, making it difficult for young adults to afford living on their own. In conclusion, while seeking independence is an important aspect of growing up, I believe that living with families for a longer time can provide young adults with the necessary support, guidance, and skills to succeed in life. It allows them to develop gradually and make a smoother transition into adulthood, rather than struggling to make ends meet on their own. Ultimately, the decision to seek independence or live with family depends on individual circumstances, but I firmly believe that living with family can have numerous benefits for young adults.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The debate over who should be responsible for cleaning up the environment has sparked intense discussion among individuals, companies, and governments. While some argue that the government should take the lead in environmental conservation, others believe that companies and private individuals should bear the responsibility. In my opinion, I think that the responsibility for cleaning up the environment should be shared among all parties.On one hand, the government has the authority and resources to implement policies and regulations that can have a significant impact on reducing pollution and protecting natural resources. Governments can enforce laws, provide funding for environmental projects, and raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect governments to play a leading role in environmental protection.On the other hand, companies and private individuals also have a crucial role to play in environmental conservation. Companies can adopt sustainable practices, reduce waste, and invest in renewable energy. Private individuals can make conscious choices about their daily habits, such as reducing plastic use, conserving water, and recycling. Moreover, companies and individuals can also support environmental initiatives and projects through donations and volunteer work.In conclusion, cleaning up the environment is a collective responsibility that requires the efforts of governments, companies, and private individuals. Rather than relying on one party to take sole responsibility, we should work together to protect our planet. By sharing the responsibility, we can pool our resources, expertise, and knowledge to achieve a greater impact. Ultimately, it is only through a collaborative effort that we can ensure a sustainable and environmentally-friendly future for generations to come.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;The notion that high sales of a product are primarily driven by effective advertisement strategies has sparked intense debate. While advertising plays a crucial role in boosting sales, I only partially agree with this statement.On one hand, good advertisement strategies can indeed contribute significantly to high sales. Advertising increases brand awareness, informs potential customers about the product, and creates an emotional connection with the target audience. For instance, a well-designed advertisement can create a buzz around a new product launch, generating interest and driving sales. Companies like Coca-Cola and Nike have successfully utilized advertising to create memorable brand identities and boost sales.On the other hand, high sales can also be attributed to other factors such as product quality, pricing, distribution, and customer service. If a product is of poor quality or overpriced, no amount of advertising can guarantee high sales. Word-of-mouth recommendations, driven by excellent customer service, can also be a powerful driver of sales. Furthermore, in today's digital age, social media and online reviews can have a profound impact on purchasing decisions, often overshadowing the influence of traditional advertising.Additionally, some products may have inherent appeal due to their novelty, necessity, or cultural relevance, leading to high sales regardless of advertising efforts. For example, a new technological gadget may sell well due to its innovative features rather than just its advertising campaign.In conclusion, while good advertisement strategies are undoubtedly important for sales, they are not the sole determinant of high sales. Product quality, pricing, customer service, and other factors also play a significant role. Therefore, it is an oversimplification to attribute high sales primarily to good advertisement strategies. A comprehensive approach that considers multiple factors is necessary to achieve and sustain high sales figures.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The question of whether a high percentage of young people attending university is beneficial to a country has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, some people believe that a large number of university-educated young people can bring numerous benefits to a country. They argue that universities provide students with valuable skills, knowledge, and critical thinking abilities, which are essential for a country's economic growth and development. A well-educated workforce can lead to innovation, and entrepreneurship, creating new job opportunities and driving economic progress.On the other hand, some people claim that a high percentage of young people attending university can lead to unemployment. They argue that the job market may not be able to absorb the large number of graduates, resulting in a surplus of skilled workers competing for a limited number of jobs. This can lead to frustration, disappointment, and disillusionment among young people, who may feel that their university education has not provided them with the expected career opportunities.In my opinion, a high percentage of young people attending university can be beneficial to a country, but it is crucial to ensure that the education system is aligned with the needs of the job market. Governments and educational institutions should work together to provide students with relevant skills and training, and to create job opportunities that match the skills and qualifications of graduates. By doing so, a country can reap the benefits of a highly educated workforce, while minimizing the risks of unemployment. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the needs of both the economy and the job market is necessary to maximize the benefits of university education for young people.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"The use of mobile phones has become an integral part of modern life, with billions of people around the world relying on them for communication, entertainment, and information. However, the increasing dependence on mobile phones has also given rise to several social, medical, and technical problems. On the social front, mobile phones have been linked to decreased face-to-face interaction, increased distractions, and a rise in cyberbullying. People are spending more time interacting with their phones than with real people, leading to a decline in deep, meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant notifications and alerts from mobile phones can be distracting, causing accidents, decreasing productivity, and affecting mental health.Medically, mobile phones have been associated with several health risks, including radiation exposure, sleep deprivation, and eye strain. The World Health Organization has classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, which are emitted by mobile phones, as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"". Furthermore, the blue light emitted from mobile phones can suppress melatonin production, leading to sleep disorders and other related health problems.Technically, mobile phones are also vulnerable to hacking, data breaches, and other cyber threats. With the increasing amount of personal data stored on mobile phones, the risk of identity theft and financial fraud has increased. Additionally, the rapid obsolescence of mobile phones has led to a significant amount of electronic waste, contributing to environmental pollution.Despite these problems, the benefits of mobile phones, including increased connectivity, access to information, and convenience, cannot be ignored. However, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the associated problems to ensure that the use of mobile phones is safe, responsible, and sustainable. By being aware of these issues and taking steps to mitigate them, we can maximize the benefits of mobile phones while minimizing their negative impacts. Ultimately, a balanced approach to mobile phone use is necessary to ensure that the benefits outweigh the problems."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The use of computers has become an integral part of daily life, and children are no exception. While computers offer a wealth of information and educational resources, I agree that using them every day can have more negative than positive effects on children.On the one hand, computers can provide children with a vast array of educational materials, improve their typing skills, and enhance their knowledge in various subjects. However, the negative effects of excessive computer use on children far outweigh the benefits. Spending too much time on computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Additionally, excessive computer use can result in social isolation, as children spend more time interacting with screens than with their peers and family members.Furthermore, excessive computer use can also affect children's cognitive and emotional development. It can lead to a decrease in attention span, as children are constantly bombarded with stimuli and notifications, making it difficult for them to focus on one task for an extended period. Moreover, the easy access to violent and explicit content on the internet can have a detrimental effect on children's emotional well-being and moral values.In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for learning and development, excessive use can have more negative than positive effects on children. Parents and caregivers should monitor and limit computer use, encourage physical activity, and engage children in social and outdoor activities to ensure a healthy and balanced childhood. By doing so, we can help children reap the benefits of computer use while minimizing its negative consequences.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The establishment of a large factory near our community has brought about a mix of advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, the factory has created a significant number of job opportunities for local residents, which has helped to reduce unemployment rates and boost the local economy. Many families have benefited from the stable income generated by these jobs, and the overall standard of living in the community has improved.Additionally, the factory has contributed to the development of infrastructure in the area, such as roads, transportation systems, and utilities. This has made it easier for people to commute to work, school, and other essential services, enhancing the overall quality of life in the community. The factory has also attracted other businesses and services to the area, such as restaurants, shops, and entertainment facilities, which has enriched the social and cultural landscape of our community.However, the presence of the factory has also had some negative impacts on our community. The most significant concern is the environmental pollution caused by the factory's operations. The air and water pollution have affected the health and wellbeing of local residents, particularly the elderly and young children. The noise and traffic generated by the factory have also disrupted the peaceful atmosphere of the community, making it difficult for people to rest and enjoy their homes.Furthermore, the influx of new workers and their families has put a strain on local resources, such as schools, healthcare facilities, and housing. The community has had to adapt to the increased demand for services, which has been challenging. In conclusion, while the large factory near our community has brought many benefits, it is essential to mitigate the negative impacts to ensure that the community can thrive and enjoy the advantages of industrial development while maintaining a healthy and sustainable environment.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The advent of modern technology and culinary innovations has made food preparation significantly easier. With the rise of pre-packaged meals, microwaveable dishes, and online recipe platforms, the time and effort required to cook a meal have been drastically reduced. While this convenience may seem like a blessing, it is essential to examine the implications of this trend.On the one hand, the ease of food preparation has numerous benefits. It saves time, allowing individuals to allocate more hours to other aspects of their lives, such as work, leisure, or personal development. Additionally, pre-packaged meals and meal delivery services have made it possible for people with busy schedules or those who lack cooking skills to access nutritious meals. This has improved food accessibility and reduced the likelihood of relying on unhealthy, fast-food options.On the other hand, the increased reliance on convenient food preparation methods has some drawbacks. The over-reliance on pre-packaged and processed foods can lead to a decline in cooking skills and an increase in consumption of unhealthy ingredients. Furthermore, the environmental impact of single-use packaging and the carbon footprint of meal delivery services cannot be ignored. Moreover, the loss of traditional cooking techniques and the cultural significance of food preparation may also be compromised as people increasingly rely on convenient, yet often impersonal, food options.In conclusion, while the ease of food preparation has its advantages, it is crucial to strike a balance between convenience and the potential negative consequences. By being mindful of our food choices and making an effort to cook from scratch occasionally, we can enjoy the benefits of convenient food preparation while also preserving traditional cooking techniques and promoting a healthier, more sustainable relationship with food.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;I disagree with the statement that the best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. While financial aid can be a crucial factor in supporting the development of a country, it is not the sole solution to their problems. In many cases, financial aid can even create dependency and undermine the country's ability to develop its own economy.Providing financial aid can be beneficial in the short term, as it can help to alleviate poverty, support infrastructure development, and provide basic necessities like food and shelter. However, it does not address the underlying issues that hinder a country's development, such as lack of education, poor governance, and limited access to technology. In fact, an over-reliance on financial aid can create a culture of dependency, where the country becomes reliant on external support rather than developing its own economic capabilities.Moreover, there are other ways to assist developing countries that can be more effective in the long run. For instance, providing technical assistance, sharing knowledge and expertise, and supporting capacity building can help a country to develop its own institutions and systems. Additionally, promoting trade and investment can help to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and reduce poverty.In conclusion, while financial aid can be a useful tool in supporting the development of a country, it is not the only way to assist developing countries. A more comprehensive approach that includes technical assistance, capacity building, and trade promotion can be more effective in promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement and believe that a multifaceted approach is needed to truly support the development of these countries.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;I strongly disagree with the notion that society should ban all forms of advertising. While it is true that some advertising can be misleading or harmful, it is an oversimplification to assert that advertising has no purpose and causes only damages. Advertising plays a vital role in the economy and society, serving as a means of communication between businesses and consumers.On one hand, advertising provides consumers with essential information about products and services, enabling them to make informed decisions. It also fosters competition among businesses, driving innovation and improving product quality. Furthermore, advertising is a significant source of revenue for media outlets, supporting the production of content and facilitating the dissemination of information.On the other hand, it is acknowledged that some advertising can have negative consequences, such as promoting unhealthy habits or materialism. However, rather than banning all advertising, it would be more effective to implement regulations and standards to ensure that advertisements are truthful and respectful. This approach would allow the benefits of advertising to be preserved while minimizing its potential harms.Additionally, a complete ban on advertising would likely have unintended consequences, such as limiting freedom of expression and stifling economic growth. It is more reasonable to encourage responsible advertising practices and to educate consumers to critically evaluate the advertisements they are exposed to. In conclusion, while advertising can have its drawbacks, it is not entirely without purpose or inherently damaging. A balanced approach that promotes responsible advertising and educated consumption is a more sensible solution than a blanket ban.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The role of women in society has undergone significant changes over the years, and it is undeniable that there are more opportunities available to them now than in the past. While some people believe that women should focus on earning a living, others think that their primary responsibility lies in taking care of the household. In my opinion, I strongly believe that women should have the freedom to choose between working and managing the household, as both roles are equally important and valuable.On one hand, women who choose to work outside the home bring in a second income, which can greatly improve the standard of living for their families. Moreover, working women can also pursue their passions, develop their skills, and gain a sense of independence and self-fulfillment. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on their mental and emotional well-being.On the other hand, women who choose to care for the household play a crucial role in nurturing and educating their children, managing the household, and providing emotional support to their family members. This role is often undervalued and underappreciated, but it is essential for the well-being and stability of the family.Ultimately, I believe that women should have the autonomy to make their own choices and decisions about their roles in society. Whether they choose to work, care for the household, or do both, they should be respected and supported in their decisions. By providing women with more opportunities and choices, we can create a more equitable and just society where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential. By embracing and valuing the diversity of women's roles, we can work towards a brighter and more inclusive future for all.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The debate on who should bear the cost of university education has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that the government should provide free university education, I partially agree that students or their parents should pay for university education.On the one hand, providing free university education can have numerous benefits. It can lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which can contribute to the country's economic growth and development. Moreover, it can also promote social mobility and equality, as students from low-income backgrounds can have equal access to higher education. However, the cost of providing free university education can be prohibitively expensive for the government, and may divert funds away from other essential public services such as healthcare and infrastructure.On the other hand, requiring students or their parents to pay for university education can have several advantages. It can encourage students to take their studies more seriously and appreciate the value of their education. Additionally, it can also promote a sense of personal responsibility and accountability among students. Furthermore, many universities rely on tuition fees to fund their operations, and without these fees, they may struggle to provide quality education and facilities.In conclusion, while I understand the importance of making university education accessible to all, I believe that students or their parents should pay for university education. However, the government can still provide financial assistance to students who cannot afford tuition fees, such as scholarships, grants, and low-interest loans. This way, students who are willing to invest in their education can do so, while those who are less fortunate can still have access to higher education. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the needs of both the government and the students is necessary to ensure that university education is accessible and affordable for all.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The proliferation of cars on British roads has been phenomenal, with numbers skyrocketing from a single vehicle in 1888 to a projected 29 million by the year 2000. This exponential growth has raised concerns about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of car dependency. In light of these issues, I agree that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use.The reliance on cars has severe environmental consequences, including air pollution, noise pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the sheer number of vehicles on the road contributes to congestion, accidents, and stress. Encouraging alternative forms of transport, such as cycling, walking, and public transportation, can significantly mitigate these problems. Governments and local authorities can promote these alternatives by investing in infrastructure, such as bike lanes, pedestrianized zones, and efficient public transport systems.Additionally, introducing international laws to control car ownership and use can help reduce the negative impacts of car culture. Such laws could include regulations on emissions, fuel efficiency, and safety standards. They could also promote car-sharing, ride-sharing, and other collaborative transportation models. By controlling the number of cars on the road and promoting more sustainable transportation options, we can create healthier, more livable cities and reduce our carbon footprint.However, it is essential to acknowledge that cars will likely remain a necessary mode of transportation for many people, particularly in rural areas where public transport is limited. Therefore, any regulations or laws introduced should be balanced and consider the needs of different communities. In conclusion, I strongly agree that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use, as this can help create a more sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and equitable transportation system.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The debate about whether rich countries should provide financial help to poor countries has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I agree that rich countries should provide financial assistance to poor countries, albeit with certain conditions.On the one hand, providing financial aid to poor countries can have a significant impact on alleviating poverty and promoting economic growth. Rich countries have a moral obligation to help those in need, and by doing so, they can also benefit from a more stable and prosperous global economy. Additionally, financial aid can be used to support development projects, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which are essential for a country's long-term growth and development.On the other hand, some argue that financial aid can create dependency and undermine the recipient country's ability to develop its own economy. Moreover, there is a risk that aid may be misused or diverted by corrupt governments, which can exacerbate poverty and inequality. However, I believe that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that aid is conditional on good governance, transparency, and accountability.In conclusion, I believe that rich countries should provide financial help to poor countries, but with careful consideration and conditions. By doing so, they can help alleviate poverty, promote economic growth, and support sustainable development. Ultimately, the goal of financial aid should be to empower poor countries to become self-sufficient and economically independent, rather than creating dependency. With responsible and effective aid, rich countries can make a significant contribution to reducing global poverty and promoting a more equitable and prosperous world.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";The advent of globalization has revolutionized the world's economics, fostering unprecedented growth and interconnectedness among nations. While it is undeniable that globalization has had a profoundly positive impact on the global economy, I firmly believe that its negative consequences should not be overlooked.On the one hand, globalization has created new opportunities for international trade, investment, and cultural exchange. It has enabled countries to specialize in their comparative advantages,, as posited by David Ricardo's theory, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. This, in turn, has led to higher economic growth, lower prices, and improved living standards for millions of people worldwide. Furthermore, globalization has facilitated the transfer of technology, knowledge, and innovation, allowing developing countries to bridge the gap with their developed counterparts.On the other hand, however, globalization has also been criticized for its detrimental effects on local industries, employment, and the environment. The influx of cheap imports has led to the decline of domestic manufacturing, causing job losses and economic instability in many countries. Moreover, the pursuit of cheaper labor and resources has resulted in the exploitation of workers in developing countries, perpetuating poverty and inequality. Additionally, the increased transportation and consumption patterns associated with globalization have contributed to environmental degradation and climate change.In conclusion, while globalization has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the world's economics, its negative side effects should not be forgotten. It is crucial for policymakers and international organizations to acknowledge and address these concerns, ensuring that the benefits of globalization are shared equitably and sustainably among all nations and people. By doing so, we can mitigate the adverse consequences of globalization and create a more just and prosperous world for all.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The notion that children who are uninterested in academics should be allowed to leave school early to pursue a job has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, it can be argued that forcing children to stay in school when they have no desire to learn can be detrimental to their well-being and the overall educational environment. Disruptive behavior from uninterested students can indeed hinder the learning experience of their peers, who are eager to succeed. By allowing these students to leave school early, they can focus on finding a job that suits their skills and interests, potentially leading to a more fulfilling and productive life.On the other hand, however, it is crucial to consider the long-term implications of leaving school early. In today's competitive job market, a lack of education can severely limit one's career prospects and earning potential. Moreover, the skills and knowledge acquired in school, such as literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking, are essential for success in most professions. By leaving school early, students may be putting themselves at a significant disadvantage, potentially leading to a life of unemployment or low-skilled, low-paid work.Rather than allowing students to leave school early, it may be more beneficial to introduce alternative educational pathways that cater to different interests and learning styles. Vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and online courses can provide students with a sense of purpose and direction, while also equipping them with the skills and knowledge required to succeed in their chosen field. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between accommodating the needs of all students and ensuring that they acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in their future endeavors.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The notion that high sales of popular consumer goods are driven by the power of advertising rather than the real needs of society has sparked intense debate. While I acknowledge that advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer preferences, I only partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, advertising has become an indispensable tool for businesses to create demand and influence consumer behavior. Through clever marketing campaigns, companies can create a perceived need for a product, which may not have been a necessity otherwise. The sales of luxury goods, such as high-end clothing and jewelry, are a prime example of this phenomenon. In this case, the high sales can be attributed to effective advertising, which creates a desire for these products among consumers.On the other hand, I disagree that advertising is the sole driver of sales. Many consumer goods, such as food, toiletries, and electronics, are essential to daily life and their sales reflect the real needs of society. For instance, the high sales of smartphones can be attributed to their utility and functionality, rather than just advertising. People need these devices to stay connected, access information, and perform various tasks, making them a necessity in modern life.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly plays a significant role in driving sales, it is not the only factor. The relationship between advertising and sales is complex, and the extent to which advertising influences sales varies depending on the product and its utility. Ultimately, it is a combination of both advertising and the real needs of society that determines the sales of consumer goods.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The debate over gun ownership has been a longstanding and contentious issue. While some argue that the right to bear arms is essential for personal freedom and security, others contend that the ownership of guns should be limited due to the potential risks and consequences associated with it. In this essay, I will argue that the ownership of guns should indeed be limited.First and foremost, the primary concern with unrestricted gun ownership is the increased risk of gun-related violence and accidents. When guns are readily available, the likelihood of them being used in violent crimes or accidental shootings rises significantly. Limiting gun ownership would help to reduce the number of guns in circulation, thereby decreasing the potential for harm. Moreover, the ease with which guns can be obtained has been linked to higher rates of homicide, suicide, and domestic violence.Furthermore, limiting gun ownership would also help to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, such as those of criminals, children, or individuals with a history of mental illness. Stricter background checks and licensing requirements would ensure that only responsible and law-abiding citizens are able to possess firearms. This, in turn, would help to create a safer and more secure society for all.In addition, many countries with strict gun control laws have seen a significant reduction in gun-related deaths and injuries. For example, Australia's introduction of strict gun laws in 1996 led to a marked decrease in gun-related homicides. This suggests that limiting gun ownership can have a positive impact on public safety and wellbeing.In conclusion, while the right to bear arms is an important aspect of personal freedom, it is essential to balance this right with the need to protect public safety. Limiting the ownership of guns would help to reduce gun-related violence, prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, and create a safer society for all. Therefore, it is crucial that governments take a proactive approach to regulating gun ownership and work towards creating a more secure and peaceful world.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. While I agree that these events can have a positive impact, I also believe that their effects can be limited and sometimes even counterproductive.On the one hand, the football World Cup and similar international sporting events do provide a platform for countries to come together and engage in a shared experience. The excitement and camaraderie generated by these events can help to foster a sense of global community and shared humanity, which can in turn ease international tensions. Moreover, the patriotic emotions released during these events can be a safe and healthy outlet for national pride and enthusiasm.On the other hand, the intense rivalries and nationalist sentiments that often accompany these events can also exacerbate existing tensions and create new ones. For instance, the  of fans from different countries can sometimes boil over into violence and hostility, undermining the potential for international understanding and cooperation. Additionally, the enormous resources and attention devoted to these events can distract from more pressing global issues and problems that require collective action and cooperation.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the football World Cup do have the potential to ease international tensions and provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, their impact should not be overstated. These events are only one part of a broader fabric of international relations and global citizenship, and their effects can be complex and multifaceted. Ultimately, a more nuanced understanding of the role of sports in international relations is needed to fully appreciate both their benefits and limitations.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The impact of technology on the socioeconomic divide has sparked intense debate in recent years. On one hand, some individuals argue that the increasing range of technology available to individuals is widening the gap between the rich and the poor. They contend that those with greater financial resources have access to the latest and most advanced technologies, which in turn enhance their productivity, and ultimately, their wealth. In contrast, those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may struggle to afford even basic technological tools, hindering their ability to compete in the modern economy.On the other hand, some people believe that technology has a leveling effect, bridging the gap between the rich and the poor. They argue that technological advancements, such as the internet and mobile devices, have made it possible for people from all walks of life to access vast amounts of information, educational resources, and job opportunities. For instance, online platforms have democratized access to education and employment, enabling individuals to acquire new skills and secure better-paying jobs, regardless of their background.In my opinion, technology has the potential to both widen and bridge the socioeconomic gap, depending on how it is utilized and distributed. However, with the right policies and initiatives in place, such as affordable access to technology and digital literacy programs, I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for reducing inequality. By providing people with the skills and resources they need to participate in the digital economy, technology can empower marginalized communities and foster greater social mobility. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared equitably, and that its potential to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor is fully realized.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;The investment of governments in outer space exploration has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that the vast sums of money spent on space travel are a waste, I firmly believe that this investment is reasonable and justified.Firstly, space exploration has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries and innovations that have greatly benefited society. For instance, satellite technology, which was developed through space research, has revolutionized the field of communication, enabling global connectivity and facilitating international trade. Moreover,, advancements in space medicine have improved our understanding of the human body and led to the development of new treatments for various diseases.Secondly, space exploration has the potential to unlock new resources and opportunities for economic growth. As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for resources such as food, water, and energy is increasing exponentially. Space exploration could provide a solution to this problem by enabling the exploitation of resources found on other planets and celestial bodies. For example, NASA's plans to return humans to the moon by 2024 could lead to the discovery of new mineral deposits, which could be used to sustain human life on Earth.Lastly, investing in space exploration can also have significant long-term benefits for the environment. By exploring and understanding the universe, we can gain valuable insights into the formation and evolution of our planet, which can inform our efforts to mitigate climate change and protect the environment. Furthermore, space-based technologies such as solar panels and renewable energy systems can provide sustainable solutions to our energy needs, reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing carbon emissions.In conclusion, while the investment in outer space exploration may seem expensive, I firmly believe that it is a reasonable and necessary expenditure. The potential benefits of space research, from advancing our understanding of the universe to unlocking new resources and opportunities for economic growth, make it an investment worth making.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;The concept of teenagers having jobs while being students is a debated topic in many countries. In my opinion, having a job as a teenager can be beneficial, but it depends on the circumstances. On the one hand, a part-time job can provide teenagers with valuable work experience, skills, and a sense of responsibility. It can also help them develop time management skills, as they learn to balance their schoolwork with their job commitments. Additionally, earning their own money can teach them the importance of budgeting and financial management.Moreover, having a job can also broaden their social circle, as they interact with colleagues and customers from diverse backgrounds. Many students who work part-time report feeling more confident and independent, as they are able to contribute to their family's income or save for their own future. For instance, a student who works as a tutor can gain teaching experience, while a student who works in retail can develop customer service skills.However, it is crucial that the job does not interfere with their academic performance. If the work hours are excessive or the job is too demanding, it can negatively impact their studies. Therefore, it is essential for parents, schools, and employers to ensure that the job does not compromise the student's education. Ultimately, having a job as a teenager can be a positive experience, as long as it is balanced with their academic responsibilities. By working part-time, teenagers can gain essential life skills, build their character, and prepare themselves for their future careers. In conclusion, having a job while being a student can be beneficial, as it provides valuable experience, skills, and a sense of responsibility, as long as it does not compromise their academic performance.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to institutions or organizations for short periods of unpaid work has become increasingly common in recent years. This trend, often referred to as work experience or internship, aims to provide students with hands-on experience and skills in a real-world setting. To a significant extent, this practice is beneficial to both the students and the organizations involved.For students, the benefits are multifaceted. Firstly, it offers them an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations, thereby enhancing their understanding and retention of the subject matter. Secondly, it exposes them to the professional environment, allowing them to develop essential skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These experiences are invaluable in preparing students for their future careers, making them more competitive in the job market. Additionally, internships can sometimes lead to job offers, providing a direct pathway to employment after graduation.From the perspective of the organizations, hosting students for unpaid work can be equally beneficial. It provides them with an influx of fresh ideas and perspectives, as students often bring innovative approaches to tasks. Moreover, it serves as a recruitment tool, allowing organizations to assess potential future employees without a long-term commitment. Organizations also benefit from the manpower, as students can assist with projects and tasks, thereby increasing productivity. Furthermore, contributing to the education and development of future professionals can enhance an organization's corporate social responsibility image, potentially attracting more clients and top talent.However, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks, such as the exploitation of unpaid labor. Nonetheless, when properly structured, these work experiences can be a win-win situation, offering students invaluable practical knowledge and organizations a glimpse into the future workforce, while also contributing to societal development. In conclusion, the practice of sending students to institutions for unpaid work is largely beneficial, providing mutual advantages that can shape the next generation of professionals and contribute to the growth of organizations.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The notion that paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and increase their productivity is a topic of ongoing debate. While financial incentives can undoubtedly play a significant role in motivating employees, I disagree that it is the only possible motivator.On the one hand, paying employees a higher salary or providing financial bonuses can be an effective way to boost motivation and productivity. Employees who feel that their hard work is being recognized and rewarded are more likely to be motivated to work harder and deliver high-quality results. Moreover, financial incentives can help to attract and retain top talent in a competitive job market.On the other hand, research has shown that there are many other factors that can motivate employees to work harder and increase their productivity. These include a sense of purpose and fulfillment, a positive work-life balance, non-monetary benefits such as training and development opportunities, and a supportive and appreciative work environment. Additionally, employees who feel that their work is meaningful and contributes to a larger goal are often more motivated and productive than those who are solely motivated by financial rewards.In conclusion, paying more money can be a motivator for some employees, but it is not the only possible motivator. Employers should consider a range of factors when trying to motivate their employees, including non-monetary benefits, a positive work environment and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. By taking a more holistic approach to motivation, employers can create a more productive and engaged workforce. Ultimately, a combination of financial and non-financial motivators is likely to be the most effective way to boost employee motivation and productivity.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;"The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. While some argue that these events can bring people together and promote unity, I partially agree with the statement.On the one hand, international sporting events do provide a platform for nations to come together, which can help to ease tensions and improve relationships between countries. The football World Cup, for instance, brings together millions of people from different cultures and backgrounds, creating a shared experience that transcends national boundaries. This shared enthusiasm can lead to a sense of camaraderie and shared humanity, potentially reducing tensions between nations.On the other hand, these events can also be a source of conflict and intensified patriotism, which may not always be expressed in a safe or respectful manner. The intense rivalry and nationalism that often accompany these competitions can lead to clashes between fans, and in some cases, even violence. Furthermore, the emphasis on winning and national pride can create an ""us versus them"" mentality, which may exacerbate existing tensions rather than ease them.In conclusion, while international sporting events have the potential to bring people together and ease tensions, they are not a guaranteed solution to releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. The outcome depends on various factors, including the context, the attitude of the fans, and the media coverage. Therefore, I believe that these events can be a positive force, but their impact should not be overstated, and efforts should be made to ensure that they promote unity and respect rather than conflict and division."
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The notion that governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy has gained significant traction in recent years. I strongly agree with this opinion, as the benefits of alternative energy sources far outweigh those of traditional fossil fuels.First and foremost, alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are renewable and sustainable, making them a more environmentally friendly option. The burning of fossil fuels, on the other hand, has been linked to climate change, air pollution, and a host of other environmental problems. By promoting alternative energy sources, governments can help mitigate these issues and create a cleaner, healthier environment for their citizens.Furthermore, alternative energy sources can also help reduce a country's reliance on imported fuels, improving energy security and reducing the impact of price volatility. This can have significant economic benefits, as it can help reduce the burden on households and businesses, and create new job opportunities in the renewable energy sector.In addition, governments can promote alternative energy sources through a range of policies, including tax incentives, subsidies, and investments in renewable energy infrastructure. They can also implement policies to increase energy efficiency, such as building codes and appliance standards. By taking a proactive approach to promoting alternative energy sources, governments can help drive innovation, reduce costs, and make renewable energy more accessible to households and businesses.In conclusion, I firmly believe that governments should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. The benefits of alternative energy sources, including reduced environmental impact, improved energy security, and economic benefits, make them an attractive option for governments looking to create a more sustainable energy future. By prioritizing alternative energy sources, governments can help create a cleaner, more prosperous, and more sustainable future for their citizens.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The notion that the government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help has sparked intense debate. In my opinion, I agree with this statement. Providing direct financial assistance to the unemployed can have a profound impact on their lives and the overall economy.First and foremost, direct financial help can serve as a vital lifeline for individuals who have lost their jobs, allowing them to meet their basic needs and maintain a semblance of dignity. Unemployment can be a devastating experience, leading to financial instability, stress, and anxiety. By offering direct financial support, the government can help alleviate some of the pressures associated with job loss, thereby enabling individuals to focus on finding new employment opportunities.Moreover, direct financial aid can also have a positive effect on the economy. When people receive financial assistance, they are more likely to spend it locally, thereby injecting money into the economy and supporting local businesses. This, in turn, can help stimulate economic growth and create new job opportunities. Additionally, direct financial help can also reduce the likelihood of poverty and homelessness, which can have long-term consequences for both individuals and society as a whole.However, some may argue that direct financial help can create dependency and discourage people from seeking employment. Nevertheless, I believe that with proper implementation and conditions, such as job training and education programs, direct financial aid can be an effective tool in supporting the unemployed and promoting economic recovery. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help, as it can provide a necessary safety net, stimulate economic growth, and help individuals get back on their feet.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The role of universities has been a topic of debate in recent years, with some arguing that they should focus on preparing students for the workforce, while others believe that their primary function should be to provide access to knowledge for its own sake. In my opinion, the main function of a university should be a balance between the two.On one hand, universities should equip students with the knowledge and skills required in the workplace, as this is what employers expect from graduates. This is particularly important in fields such as engineering, medicine, and law, where practical skills are essential. By providing students with relevant training and experience, universities can increase their chances of securing employment and contributing to the economy.On the other hand, universities should also provide access to knowledge for its own sake, allowing students to explore and understand various subjects without the pressure of immediate practical application. This approach fosters critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual curiosity, which are essential for personal growth and societal progress. Moreover, it enables students to pursue their passions and interests, even if they may not lead to immediate employment.Ultimately, the main function of a university should be to provide a well-rounded education that combines both practical skills and theoretical knowledge. By doing so, universities can produce graduates who are not only employable but also intellectually curious, critically thinking, and passionate about their field of study. This balanced approach will enable students to succeed in their chosen careers, while also contributing to the advancement of knowledge and society as a whole.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some people may view zoos as merely entertainment venues, I believe they serve several important functions. Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in conservation efforts. Many zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, which helps to increase their population and reduce the risk of extinction. For example, the California Condor breeding program in the San Diego Zoo has been instrumental in recovering this species from the brink of extinction.Additionally, zoos provide valuable educational opportunities for the public. They offer a unique chance for people, especially children, to learn about and appreciate the diversity of wildlife. By observing animals in a controlled environment, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of their behavior, habitat, and adaptations. This can foster empathy and inspire people to take action in protecting wildlife and their habitats.Furthermore, zoos often support scientific research and provide a platform for scientists to study animal behavior, physiology, and biology. This research can lead to important discoveries and advancements in fields such as veterinary medicine, ecology, and conservation biology. For instance, the study of animal behavior in zoos has contributed to our understanding of social behavior, communication, and problem-solving abilities in various species.In conclusion, zoos have a multifaceted purpose that extends beyond mere entertainment. They contribute significantly to conservation, education, and scientific research, making them a valuable institution in modern society. Rather than having no useful purpose, I firmly believe that zoos are essential in promoting the well-being and preservation of wildlife, and educating the public about the importance of conservation and sustainability.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way we approach education, offering flexibility and accessibility to a broader range of students. However, the debate surrounding the efficacy of these programs compared to traditional in-person college or university attendance persists. In my opinion, while distance-learning programs have their advantages, I partially agree that they may not be as effective as in-person education in certain aspects.On the one hand, distance-learning programs provide unparalleled flexibility, allowing students to manage their time effectively and balance academic responsibilities with work or family commitments. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who cannot relocate due to personal or professional obligations. Moreover, distance-learning programs often offer a wider range of courses and specializations than traditional institutions, catering to niche interests and providing access to renowned faculty from around the globe.On the other hand, I believe that in-person education offers unique benefits that distance-learning programs struggle to replicate. The social interaction and human connection inherent in a traditional university setting are invaluable, fostering networks, friendships, and a sense of community that are difficult to replicate in a virtual environment. Additionally, in-person attendance allows for spontaneous discussions, debates, and questions that arise during lectures, promoting a deeper understanding and engagement with the material.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs are undoubtedly a valuable resource, offering flexibility and accessibility, I agree that they may lack the comprehensive educational experience provided by in-person attendance. The benefits of social interaction, immediate feedback, and a structured learning environment make traditional university education unique and, in many cases, more effective. Nonetheless, distance-learning programs will continue to play a vital role in expanding educational opportunities, and their value should not be understated.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technology has revolutionized the way people interact and access information. While some individuals have greatly benefited from this technological advancement, others have been left behind. In my opinion, I partially agree that some people have not benefited from modern communication technology.On the one hand, modern communication technology has opened up numerous opportunities for people to connect with each other and access a vast amount of information. For instance, social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away. Additionally, online educational resources and e-learning platforms have made it possible for people to acquire new skills and knowledge from the comfort of their own homes. Many individuals, particularly those in urban areas with access to reliable internet connectivity, have greatly benefited from these technologies.On the other hand, there are still many people who have not benefited from modern communication technology. This is particularly true for those living in rural or disadvantaged areas where internet access is limited or non-existent. Furthermore, older adults or those with limited technological literacy may struggle to navigate and utilize these technologies, resulting in a sense of isolation and disconnection. Moreover, the digital divide has exacerbated existing social and economic inequalities, as those without access to modern communication technology are often left behind in terms of education, employment, and social opportunities.In conclusion, while modern communication technology has undoubtedly improved the lives of many individuals, it is also true that some people have not benefited from it. Efforts should be made to address the digital divide and ensure that everyone has equal access to these technologies, regardless of their geographical location or socio-economic background. Only then can we truly say that modern communication technology has benefited everyone.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate about whether musical lessons should be made mandatory in high school education has sparked intense discussion. While some people believe that it is a waste of time for students, I firmly argue that musical lessons should be a compulsory part of high school education.Firstly, musical lessons provide students with a unique opportunity to develop their creative skills and express themselves in a non-academic setting. Music has been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive development, improving memory, spatial-temporal skills, and language development. By incorporating musical lessons into the curriculum, students can experience these benefits firsthand, leading to a more well-rounded education.Moreover, musical lessons can also have a profound impact on students' emotional and social development. Learning to play a musical instrument or sing in a choir can help students build confidence, develop teamwork skills, and manage stress and anxiety. In an era where mental health is a growing concern among teenagers, it is essential that schools provide students with outlets for emotional expression and development.Additionally, musical lessons can also provide students with a platform to explore their cultural heritage and appreciate the diversity of musical styles from around the world. This can foster a greater sense of empathy, understanding, and appreciation for different cultures, which is essential in today's globalized society.In conclusion, making musical lessons mandatory in high school education can have a profoundly positive impact on students' cognitive, emotional, and social development. Rather than being a waste of time, musical lessons can provide students with a unique and enriching experience that complements their academic studies and prepares them for success in all areas of life.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;The statement that universities should allocate the same amount of money to their students' sports activities as they do to their university libraries is a topic of debate. While sports play a crucial role in the overall development of students, I disagree with this statement.University libraries are the backbone of academic institutions, providing students with access to a vast array of resources, including books, journals, and online databases. These resources are essential for students to conduct research,,assistant, and complete their academic assignments. Libraries also offer a quiet and conducive environment for students to study, which is vital for their academic success. Allocating a significant amount of funds to libraries ensures that students have access to the resources they need to excel academically.On the other hand, sports activities are important for the physical and mental well-being of students. However, the cost of maintaining sports facilities and equipment is relatively low compared to the cost of maintaining and updating library resources. Moreover, many universities already offer scholarships and funding to students who excel in sports, which helps to support their athletic pursuits.Instead of allocating the same amount of money to sports activities as to libraries, universities could consider allocating a reasonable amount to support sports activities, while prioritizing the needs of the library. This approach would ensure that students have access to the resources they need to succeed academically, while also supporting their physical and mental well-being. In conclusion, while sports activities are important, I believe that universities should prioritize their library budgets to ensure that students have access to the resources they need to succeed academically.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The proliferation of English as a global language has been a double-edged sword, bringing about numerous benefits while also contributing to the decline of lesser-known languages. On the one hand, the advantages of English language dominance are undeniable. It has facilitated international communication, commerce, and cultural exchange, bridging geographical divides and fostering global understanding. English has become the lingua franca of international business, science, and technology, enabling people from diverse linguistic backgrounds to interact and collaborate seamlessly.However, on the other hand, the disadvantages of English language dominance cannot be overlooked. The spread of English has led to the decline of many lesser-known languages, as younger generations increasingly opt for English as their primary language of communication. This phenomenon has severe cultural and social implications, as languages are often inextricably linked to the history, traditions, and identity of a community. The loss of a language can therefore be seen as a loss of cultural heritage and diversity.In conclusion, while the advantages of English language dominance are significant, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh them. The preservation of linguistic diversity is essential for maintaining cultural richness and promoting global understanding. Efforts should be made to promote and protect lesser-known languages, such as language education programs and cultural initiatives. Ultimately, a balance must be struck between the benefits of a global language and the need to preserve linguistic diversity, ensuring that the advantages of English do not come at the expense of cultural heritage. By doing so, we can promote a more inclusive and diverse global community, where all languages are valued and respected.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The debate about whether humans should use animals for their own benefit or protect their rights has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people believe that animals can be utilized to improve human lives, providing benefits such as food, clothing, and companionship. For instance, animals like cows and chickens are raised for their meat, dairy, and eggs, which are essential components of the human diet. Additionally, animals like horses and dogs have been domesticated and trained to assist humans in various tasks, such as transportation and search and rescue operations.On the other hand, others argue that animals have inherent rights that should be protected. They believe that animals are sentient beings, capable of feeling pain, joy, and suffering, just like humans. As such, they deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, rather than being exploited for human gain. Many animal welfare organizations and advocates argue that using animals for food, entertainment, or research is unethical and should be prohibited. They propose alternative methods, such as plant-based diets, synthetic clothing, and advanced technology, to replace animal-based products and services.In conclusion, while some people believe that animals can be used for human benefit, others argue that their rights should be protected. A balance needs to be struck between the two perspectives, ensuring that human needs are met while also safeguarding animal welfare. This can be achieved through responsible and sustainable animal husbandry practices, as well as the development of alternative methods that reduce animal exploitation. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize the intrinsic value of animals and treat them with the respect and compassion they deserve. By doing so, we can promote a more harmonious and ethical coexistence between humans and animals.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way we experience and interact with art and exhibitions. With the rise of virtual tours, online exhibitions, and high-definition digital displays, it is now possible for people to view and appreciate artworks from the comfort of their own homes. However, I disagree that this will lead to the disappearance of museums and art galleries.While technology has made it possible to access exhibitions remotely, it cannot replace the unique and immersive experience that physical museums and galleries provide. The tactile nature of art, the ability to see and appreciate the texture, scale, and detail of a piece in person, is something that cannot be replicated online. Moreover, museums and galleries offer a social and cultural experience, allowing people to come together, discuss, and learn from one another. The atmosphere and ambiance of these institutions are an integral part of the art-viewing experience and cannot be replicated in a virtual setting.Furthermore, museums and galleries play a vital role in preserving and conserving artworks, as well as providing educational programs and workshops. These institutions employ skilled curators, conservators, and educators who work tirelessly to promote art, history, and culture. The loss of museums and galleries would not only be a loss for art lovers but also for the community as a whole.In conclusion, while modern technology has certainly expanded our access to art and exhibitions, I firmly believe that museums and art galleries will continue to thrive. They offer a unique and enriching experience that cannot be replaced by virtual tours and online exhibitions. Instead, technology will likely complement and enhance the museum and gallery experience, allowing people to engage with art in new and innovative ways.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate surrounding the approach to learning school subjects has sparked intense discussion among educators and students alike. On one hand, some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, as this provides a well-rounded education and exposes them to a wide range of disciplines. This approach allows students to develop a broad knowledge base, fostering their ability to think critically and make informed decisions. Additionally, learning multiple subjects can help students discover hidden talents and interests that may not have been apparent otherwise.On the other hand, others argue that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. This approach enables students to specialize in areas where they have a natural aptitude, allowing them to excel and develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter. By concentrating on their strengths and interests, students can cultivate a sense of purpose and direction, leading to increased motivation and academic success.In my opinion, a balanced approach that incorporates elements of both views is the most effective. While it is essential to provide students with a broad foundation in various subjects, it is equally important to allow them to specialize and explore their interests in greater depth. By doing so, students can develop a strong foundation in core subjects while also pursuing their passions, leading to a more engaging and fulfilling educational experience. Ultimately, a flexible and student-centered approach to learning will enable teenagers to reach their full potential, while also preparing them for an ever-changing and increasingly complex world.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The increasing dominance of the English language has been a subject of debate in recent years, with many arguing that it is contributing to the decline of lesser-known languages. While there are valid points on both sides, the disadvantages of this phenomenon, in my opinion, outweigh the advantages.On the one hand, the spread of English has undeniable benefits. It has become a global language, facilitating communication and economic exchange between nations. This has opened up opportunities for international trade, education, and cultural exchange. Furthermore, speaking English has become a valuable skill, enabling individuals to access a vast array of information and connect with people from diverse backgrounds.On the other hand, the encroachment of English on lesser-known languages has severe consequences. The loss of linguistic diversity is a significant concern, as languages are often closely tied to cultural identity and heritage. As English becomes the dominant language, many indigenous languages are at risk of disappearing, taking with them the history, traditions, and customs of the communities that speak them. This not only leads to cultural homogenization but also results in the erosion of unique perspectives and ways of thinking.In conclusion, while the advantages of the spread of English are undeniable, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh them. The loss of linguistic diversity and cultural heritage is a significant cost that cannot be ignored. Efforts should be made to promote and preserve lesser-known languages, ensuring that they continue to thrive in the face of globalization. This can be achieved through language education programs, cultural exchange initiatives, and community-based language preservation projects. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of a global language and the importance of preserving linguistic diversity.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The notion that creative artists should have unrestricted freedom to express their ideas is a contentious issue. While I agree that artistic expression is essential for innovation and progress, the idea that there should be no government restrictions whatsoever is overly simplistic. On the one hand, giving artists complete freedom to express themselves can lead to the creation of provocative and thought-provoking works that challenge societal norms and spark meaningful discussions. Unrestricted artistic expression can also foster a culture of creativity and experimentation, which can drive social and cultural progress. Moreover, censorship can stifle innovation and limit the ability of artists to push boundaries and explore new ideas.On the other hand, completely eliminating government restrictions can have negative consequences. For instance, unrestricted artistic expression can lead to the proliferation of hate speech, graphic violence, and other forms of harmful content that can have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. Furthermore, some forms of artistic expression may infringe on the rights of others, such as privacy and copyright laws. Therefore, some level of regulation is necessary to protect the rights and well-being of all members of society.In conclusion, while I agree that creative artists should be given a significant amount of freedom to express their ideas, I disagree that there should be no government restrictions whatsoever. A balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility is necessary to ensure that artistic expression is protected while also safeguarding the rights and well-being of others. By implementing reasonable and nuanced regulations, governments can promote a culture of creativity and innovation while also protecting the greater good.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The debate about whether children should be encouraged to compete or co-operate has sparked a heated discussion among educators and parents. On one hand, some people believe that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential for their development. They argue that competition motivates children to strive for excellence, pushing them to work harder and achieve their goals. This, in turn, helps them develop valuable skills such as resilience, discipline, and determination. Furthermore, competition can prepare children for the realities of the adult world, where they will inevitably face challenges and setbacks.On the other hand, others argue that teaching children to co-operate rather than compete is more beneficial. They believe that co-operation promotes teamwork, empathy, and mutual respect, all of which are crucial for building strong relationships and achieving collective success. By working together towards a common goal, children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and develop essential social skills such as communication, active listening, and conflict resolution. Moreover, co-operation can help children develop a sense of community and social responsibility, which are vital for creating a harmonious and productive society.In my opinion, a balance between competition and co-operation is the most effective approach. While competition can drive children to achieve their personal best, excessive emphasis on winning can lead to an unhealthy obsession with individual success. On the other hand, co-operation can foster a sense of unity and shared purpose, but may not provide the necessary motivation for children to push themselves beyond their limits. Ultimately, a balanced approach that incorporates both competition and co-operation can help children develop into well-rounded, motivated, and socially responsible individuals who are equipped to succeed in all aspects of life.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";The statement that our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase without capital punishment is a contentious issue. While some argue that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society, others disagree, citing that it does not necessarily deter crime. In my opinion, I partially disagree with the statement.On one hand, capital punishment can serve as a deterrent to potential offenders, the fear of death may prevent some individuals from committing violent crimes. Furthermore, it can also provide a sense of justice and closure for the victims' families. For instance, countries like Singapore have low crime rates, and they attribute this to their strict laws, including capital punishment.On the other hand, there are several arguments against the statement. Firstly, capital punishment is not an effective deterrent, as many crimes are committed in the heat of the moment or under the influence of substances, where the perpetrator is not thinking about the consequences. Secondly, there is always a risk of executing an innocent person, which is a grave mistake that can never be rectified. Additionally, studies have shown that the rate of violent crimes is more closely related to social and economic factors, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of education, rather than the presence or absence of capital punishment.In conclusion, while capital punishment may have some benefits, such as providing a sense of justice and closure for victims' families, it is not the most effective way to control violence in society. Other factors, such as addressing social and economic issues, and improving the justice system, are more important in reducing crime rates. Therefore, I believe that our lives are not necessarily less secure without capital punishment, and that its effectiveness in controlling violence is limited.
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;The gap year, a period of time between finishing high school and starting university studies, has become a popular trend among young people in some countries. During this year, many young individuals choose to work or travel, and it has both advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, taking a gap year can be highly beneficial for young people. It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable work experience, learn new skills, and develop a sense of independence. Many students use this time to travel, explore different cultures, and broaden their perspectives, which can be incredibly enriching. Additionally, a gap year can give students a much-needed break from the rigors of academic life, allowing them to recharge and refocus before embarking on their university journey.On the other hand, there are also some drawbacks to consider. One of the main disadvantages is that taking a gap year can disrupt the momentum of a student's academic career. After a year of not studying, some students may struggle to get back into the rhythm of academic life, which can impact their performance in university. Furthermore, some students may use the gap year as an excuse to procrastinate and lose motivation, which can ultimately lead to them not pursuing higher education at all.In conclusion, taking a gap year can be a double-edged sword for young people. While it offers numerous benefits, such as gaining work experience and broadening one's perspective, it also carries the risk of disrupting academic momentum and losing motivation. Ultimately, whether or not to take a gap year is a personal decision that depends on an individual's goals, priorities, and circumstances. With careful planning and a clear sense of purpose, a gap year can be a highly rewarding and enriching experience for young people.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The world is witnessing a profound shift towards increased reliance on computers, with their applications expanding into diverse fields such as business, healthcare, crime detection, and aviation. As technology advances, it is inevitable that computers will play an even more integral role in our daily lives. In the future, we can expect to see computers being utilized in innovative areas like education, where personalized learning experiences will be tailored to individual students' needs. They will also be pivotal in environmental monitoring, predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change. Furthermore, computers will continue to revolutionize the medical field, enabling precise diagnoses, targeted treatments, and potentially leading to significant breakthroughs in disease prevention and cure.However, this growing dependence on computers raises important questions about the implications of such reliance. On one hand, the benefits of computer technology are undeniable. They enhance efficiency, accuracy, and speed in numerous sectors, contributing to overall societal progress. Computers have also opened up new avenues for communication, connectivity, and access to information, fostering a more interconnected and informed global community.On the other hand, there are valid concerns about becoming too dependent on computers. Over-reliance on technology can lead to a decline in basic skills and critical thinking abilities. Moreover, the risk of cyberattacks, data breaches, and technological failures poses significant threats to privacy, security, and infrastructure. Therefore, while embracing the advancements and benefits that computers bring, it is crucial to maintain a balanced approach. This includes investing in cybersecurity, promoting digital literacy, and ensuring that traditional skills and knowledge are not overlooked in the rush to adopt new technologies. By being aware of both the advantages and the potential pitfalls, we can harness the power of computers to improve our world, while avoiding the pitfalls of over-dependence.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The idea that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach promotes gender equality, I partially disagree with this statement.On the one hand, ensuring equal representation of both genders in every subject can help bridge the gap in fields where one gender is underrepresented. For instance, in STEM subjects, women are often outnumbered by men, and implementing such a policy could encourage more women to pursue careers in these areas. Additionally, this approach can also foster a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, which is beneficial for all students.On the other hand, enforcing a strict quota system can be problematic. It may lead to less qualified candidates being accepted over more qualified ones, simply to meet the gender balance requirement. This could compromise the academic integrity of the institution and potentially disadvantage students who are more suited to a particular subject. Furthermore, some subjects may naturally attract more students of one gender than the other, and attempting to artificially balance the numbers could be counterproductive.In conclusion, while promoting gender equality in universities is essential, I believe that a more nuanced approach is needed. Rather than accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, universities should focus on creating an environment that encourages and supports students of all genders to pursue their academic interests. This could involve targeted outreach programs, scholarships, and mentoring schemes to attract and retain underrepresented groups. By adopting a more holistic approach, universities can promote diversity and inclusion without compromising academic standards.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;The statement that people will spend less time on cooking food is a notion that has garnered significant attention in recent times. With the advent of modern technology and the increasing demands of a fast-paced lifestyle, it is plausible to assume that individuals will indeed allocate less time to cooking. I agree with this statement, and my reasoning is multifaceted.Firstly, the rise of convenience foods and meal delivery services has revolutionized the way people consume their meals. These services offer a wide range of options that can be prepared and delivered in a fraction of the time it would take to cook a meal from scratch. As a result, many individuals, especially those with hectic schedules, are opting for these quicker alternatives, thereby spending less time in the kitchen.Furthermore, advancements in cooking technology have also played a crucial role in reducing cooking time. Appliances such as microwaves, instant pots, and air fryers enable rapid meal preparation, making it possible for people to whip up a meal in a matter of minutes. This convenience, coupled with the increasing availability of pre-cut and pre-cooked ingredients, further diminishes the time required for cooking.Lastly, the shift in societal values towards busier lifestyles and the pursuit of leisure activities also supports the idea that people will spend less time cooking. As individuals prioritize other aspects of their lives, such as career development, fitness, and social engagements, the time devoted to cooking is likely to decrease.In conclusion, considering the factors of convenience, technology, and lifestyle shifts, it is reasonable to concur that people will indeed spend less time on cooking food. As the world continues to evolve and become more fast-paced, the trend towards quicker and more convenient meal options is expected to prevail.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The debate surrounding the benefits of traditional games versus modern games in developing children's skills has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that modern games have an edge over traditional ones, I firmly believe that traditional games are more useful in fostering essential skills in children.Traditional games, such as hide and seek,,assistant, tag, and board games, offer a unique set of benefits that are hard to replicate with modern games. For instance, they promote physical activity, social interaction, and cognitive development. Outdoor games like tag and hide and seek encourage children to engage in physical exercise, develop their motor skills, and learn teamwork and strategy. On the other hand, board games like chess and checkers enhance problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and spatial reasoning.In contrast, modern games, although entertaining and engaging, often lack the depth and richness of traditional games. Many modern games are designed for solo play, limiting opportunities for social interaction and teamwork. Furthermore, the over-reliance on technology can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to a range of health problems. While some modern games do offer educational content, they often lack the tactile and immersive experience provided by traditional games.Moreover, traditional games are often more accessible and affordable than modern games, which require expensive hardware and software. This makes traditional games a more inclusive option, allowing children from all backgrounds to participate and develop essential skills. In conclusion, while modern games have their advantages, I strongly agree that traditional games are more useful in developing children's skills. They offer a unique combination of physical, social, and cognitive benefits that are essential for a child's overall development. Therefore, parents and educators should encourage children to engage in traditional games to help them develop into well-rounded and skilled individuals.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds is a contentious issue, with some arguing that priorities should be placed on essential services such as medical care and education, rather than on constructing theaters or sports stadiums. I agree with this stance, as investing in healthcare and education yields long-term benefits for the nation and its citizens.Firstly, medical care and education are fundamental human rights that require substantial funding to ensure equitable access. Inadequate investment in these sectors can lead to severe consequences, including a decline in public health and a lack of skilled workforce. By prioritizing medical care, governments can improve healthcare infrastructure, employ more medical professionals, and provide quality services to citizens. Similarly, investing in education enables the development of a knowledgeable and skilled population, which is crucial for a country's economic growth and social progress.On the other hand, while theaters and sports stadiums can contribute to the cultural and recreational aspects of a society, they are not as critical as medical care and education. These facilities can be built and maintained through private investments or public-private partnerships, thereby reducing the financial burden on the government. Furthermore, the benefits of theaters and sports stadiums, such as promoting arts and physical activities, can also be achieved through alternative and more cost-effective means, such as community centers and public parks.In conclusion, given the essential role that medical care and education play in the well-being and development of a nation, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize spending on these sectors over building theaters or sports stadiums. This allocation of resources will have a more significant and lasting impact on the quality of life and future prospects of citizens.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life become obsolete with technological advancements has sparked intense debate. While some argue that it is futile to preserve these antiquated practices, I only partially agree with this sentiment.On one hand, technological progress has undeniably led to the decline of certain traditional skills. For instance, the widespread use of calculators and computers has diminished the need for manual arithmetic and mental math. Similarly, the advent of automation has replaced many manual labor jobs, rendering traditional craftsmanship less relevant. In such cases, it may seem pointless to attempt to preserve these outdated practices.On the other hand, many traditional skills and ways of life still hold significant cultural, aesthetic, and educational value. For example, traditional crafts like pottery, weaving, and woodworking not only provide a sense of community and identity but also serve as a means of preserving cultural heritage. Moreover, these skills often require a level of creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail that are essential for personal growth and development. Furthermore, many traditional practices, such as organic farming and natural healing, offer valuable alternatives to modern industrial methods and can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally conscious lifestyle.In conclusion, while some traditional skills may indeed become obsolete with technological advancements, it is not entirely pointless to try and keep them alive. Efforts to preserve and promote traditional practices can help maintain cultural diversity, provide a sense of continuity with the past, and offer unique benefits that modern technology cannot replace. Therefore, a balanced approach that acknowledges the benefits of technological progress while also preserving valuable traditional skills and ways of life is essential for a holistic and sustainable development.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";"The debate surrounding the freedom of creative artists to express their ideas has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that artists should be given absolute freedom to express themselves, others believe that governments should impose certain restrictions on their work. In my opinion, I partially agree with the idea of giving creative artists freedom to express their ideas,On the one hand, giving artists the freedom to express their ideas can lead to the creation of innovative and thought-provoking work that challenges societal norms and pushes boundaries. This freedom allows artists to express their unique perspectives and visions, which can lead to the development of new ideas and cultural movements. For instance, films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"" have brought attention to historical atrocities and sparked important conversations about human rights.On the other hand, some people argue that governments should impose restrictions on artists to prevent the spread of hate speech, obscenity, and other forms of harmful content. I agree that some restrictions are necessary to protect vulnerable members of society,In conclusion, while I believe that creative artists should be given a significant amount of freedom to express their ideas, this freedom should not be absolute. Governments should impose some restrictions to prevent harm and ensure that artistic expression does not compromise the well-being of others. Ultimately, finding a balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility is crucial to promoting a healthy and vibrant cultural landscape. By doing so, we can foster an environment where creativity and innovation can thrive while also protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals."
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The issue of whether the government should regulate the amount of violence in the media to decrease the incidence of violent crimes has sparked intense debate. While some argue that such control is necessary to prevent violent behavior, others contend that it infringes upon freedom of expression. In my opinion, I partially agree that government intervention is warranted, however, it should be balanced with the need to preserve artistic freedom.On the one hand, it is reasonable to assume that exposure to violent media can contribute to an increase in aggressive behavior among individuals, particularly children and adolescents. Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to violent content can desensitize individuals to the consequences of violent acts, potentially leading to an escalation of violent crimes. Therefore, government regulation could help mitigate this risk by limiting the amount of violence depicted in media, particularly in programs or films aimed at younger audiences.On the other hand, excessive government control over media content raises concerns about censorship and the stifling of creative expression. The media plays a crucial role in reflecting and critiquing societal issues, including violence. Overly restrictive regulations could prevent filmmakers, writers, and artists from tackling these complex themes in a realistic and thought-provoking manner. Moreover, in a democratic society, freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights that should not be unduly curtailed.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of government regulation in reducing violent crime, I believe that any such measures must be carefully considered to avoid unwarranted censorship. A balanced approach that protects vulnerable audiences while preserving artistic freedom is essential. Ultimately, education and critical thinking skills are equally important in enabling individuals to discern between fictional violence and real-life consequences, thereby fostering a more responsible and empathetic society.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The notion that the increased opportunities for women in today's society have created more problems than solutions is a contentious issue. While some individuals may argue that this shift has led to numerous challenges, I firmly disagree with this perspective.On the contrary, I believe that the growing number of opportunities for women has been a significant step forward in promoting equality and social progress. One of the primary advantages of this development is the empowerment of women, enabling them to make informed decisions about their lives, careers, and families. With greater access to education and employment, women are now able to contribute to the economy, support their families, and pursue their passions. This, in turn, has led to a more diverse and skilled workforce, driving innovation and economic growth.Moreover, the increased participation of women in various spheres has helped to break down traditional stereotypes and challenge patriarchal norms. Women are now represented in leadership positions, politics, and other areas that were previously dominated by men. This has not only inspired future generations of women but also fostered a more inclusive and equitable society. Additionally, the growing number of women in the workforce has led to a better work-life balance, as men are now more likely to share domestic responsibilities, promoting healthier and more stable families.In conclusion, the increased opportunities for women have undoubtedly solved more problems than they have created. By empowering women and promoting equality, we have made significant strides in creating a more just and prosperous society. While there may still be challenges to overcome, the benefits of women's empowerment far outweigh the drawbacks, and we should continue to work towards a future where women have equal access to opportunities and resources.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The proposition that increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems is a contentious issue. While I understand the rationale behind this approach, I only partially agree with it. On one hand, increasing petrol prices can indeed reduce the number of vehicles on the road, as driving becomes more expensive. This decrease in traffic volume can lead to a reduction in congestion and, consequently, lower emissions, which contribute to pollution. Moreover, higher petrol prices can encourage individuals to seek alternative, more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as bicycles, or public transport.On the other hand, solely relying on price hikes may not be the most effective or equitable solution. For instance, low-income families who rely heavily on their vehicles for daily commutes may be disproportionately affected, leading to financial hardships. Moreover, increasing petrol prices does not address the root causes of traffic congestion, such as urban planning issues, lack of efficient public transportation systems, or the sheer number of vehicles on the road.Other measures that could be more effective include investing in public transportation to make it more efficient, reliable, and accessible. Promoting carpooling, and implementing congestion pricing in high-traffic areas can also discourage unnecessary driving during peak hours. Furthermore, incentivizing the purchase and use of electric or hybrid vehicles through subsidies or tax breaks can directly reduce pollution without placing an undue burden on low-income households. Urban planning strategies, such as creating pedestrian-friendly and cyclist-friendly infrastructure, can also encourage a shift away from personal vehicle use. In conclusion, while increasing petrol prices may have some benefits, a multifaceted approach that includes improving public transport, encouraging carpooling, and incentivizing eco-friendly vehicles would likely be more effective and fair in tackling traffic and pollution issues.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The question of whether advertisements should be banned has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that advertisements are a necessary part of a free market economy, others claim that they are manipulative and deceptive. In my opinion, I partially agree that advertisements should be banned, but only to a certain extent.On the one hand, advertisements play a crucial role in informing consumers about new products and services, and helping businesses to reach their target audience. They also contribute to the economy by creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. Furthermore, advertisements can be entertaining and informative, providing valuable information to consumers and helping them to make informed decisions.On the other hand, some advertisements can be misleading and deceptive, making false claims about products and services. They can also be intrusive and annoying, interrupting television programs and littering public spaces. Moreover, advertisements can have a negative impact on children, promoting unhealthy foods and behaviors. In these cases, I believe that advertisements should be regulated and banned if they are found to be misleading or harmful.In conclusion, while I do not think that all advertisements should be banned, I believe that there should be stricter regulations on the advertising industry to prevent misleading and deceptive advertisements. Advertisements can be a valuable tool for businesses and consumers, but they must be used responsibly and with integrity. By regulating the industry and banning harmful advertisements, we can promote a more honest and transparent market, and protect consumers from exploitation. Ultimately, a balanced approach to advertising is necessary, one that allows for the benefits of advertisements while minimizing their negative impacts.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"The demands of modern life can be overwhelming, and it is essential to find effective ways to reduce stress. While people have different preferences when it comes to stress relief, the most effective methods, in my opinion, involve a combination of physical activity, mental calmness, and creative expression. Exercise is one of the best ways to reduce stress, as it releases endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones, which help alleviate anxiety and improve mood. For instance, yoga and walking are excellent stress-reducing activities that promote relaxation and clear the mind. Many people also find solace in reading, as it provides a healthy distraction from daily worries and allows individuals to temporarily escape into a different world.Gardening is another excellent stress-reducing activity that combines physical exercise with creative expression and a sense of accomplishment. Planting and nurturing plants can be therapeutic, allowing individuals to connect with nature and feel a sense of pride and fulfillment. Furthermore, engaging in creative pursuits such as painting, drawing, or playing music can be highly therapeutic, providing an outlet for emotions and a healthy distraction from stress.Ultimately, the key to reducing stress is to find an activity that brings joy and fulfillment, and to make it a regular part of one's routine. Whether it is exercise, reading, gardening, or creative expression, the most important thing is to find what works best for each individual and to prioritize stress reduction in daily life. By doing so, we can better navigate the challenges of modern life and maintain our physical and mental well-being."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";The advent of technology has led to a significant shift in the way we communicate, with images becoming an increasingly dominant form of expression. In my opinion, I agree that in the modern world, the image is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word.One of the primary reasons for this is the universal language of images. Unlike written text, which can be limited by language barriers, images can be understood by people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. A photograph or film can convey complex ideas and emotions in a way that transcends language, making it a more accessible and inclusive form of communication. For instance, social media platforms such as Instagram and YouTube have become incredibly popular, with users sharing and consuming vast amounts of visual content every day.Furthermore, images have the ability to evoke strong emotions and create lasting impressions. A powerful image can be more memorable and impactful than a written message, as it can tap into our emotional psyche and create a deeper connection with the viewer. This is evident in the way that advertisements and marketing campaigns often rely on striking visuals to capture our attention and leave a lasting impression.However, it is worth noting that written text still has its own unique strengths and advantages. Written communication can provide more nuanced and detailed information, and is often better suited for conveying complex ideas and arguments. Nevertheless, in the modern world, the image is undoubtedly becoming a more powerful way of communication, as it offers a unique ability to transcend language barriers and evoke strong emotions. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that the role of images in communication will only continue to grow.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The extinction of languages is a pressing issue in today's globalized world. With many languages spoken by only a handful of people, the debate rages on whether governments should allocate public funds to preserve these dying languages. On one hand, proponents of language preservation argue that governments have a responsibility to protect and promote their cultural heritage. Languages are an integral part of a community's identity and history, and their loss would mean the erasure of a unique cultural perspective. Moreover, funding language preservation initiatives could also create jobs and stimulate local economies.On the other hand, opponents of public funding for language preservation contend that it would be a waste of resources. They argue that with limited public funds, governments should prioritize more pressing issues such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Additionally, in an increasingly interconnected world, the importance of speaking a dominant language such as English or Mandarin cannot be overstated, and resources might be better spent on promoting these widely spoken languages.In my opinion, while the practical concerns of opponents are valid, I believe that governments should still invest in preserving endangered languages. Language is a vital component of cultural diversity, and its loss would have far-reaching consequences for the identity and traditions of communities. Furthermore, language preservation can also promote cultural exchange and understanding, fostering greater empathy and cooperation among nations. Therefore, I think that governments should strike a balance between allocating funds for language preservation and addressing more immediate needs, ensuring that the rich cultural tapestry of our world is preserved for future generations.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The notion that arts and music do not enhance the quality of life and that government funding should be diverted to other areas is a debatable topic. While some may argue that investing in the arts is a luxury that cannot be afforded, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.On the one hand, arts and music have been proven to have a profound impact on individuals' emotional and mental well-being. They provide a means of expression, escapism, and entertainment, which can greatly improve one's quality of life. Moreover, the arts have been shown to have cognitive benefits, particularly in children, where exposure to music and painting has been linked to enhanced creativity, spatial reasoning, and language development.On the other hand, governments that invest in the arts often see significant economic returns. The tourism industry, for instance, is heavily reliant on cultural attractions such as museums, galleries, and music festivals, which generate substantial revenue and create jobs. Furthermore, a vibrant arts scene can make a city more attractive to businesses, entrepreneurs, and young professionals, contributing to urban regeneration and growth.In conclusion, I firmly believe that arts and music are essential components of a high quality of life, and that government investment in these areas is not only justified but also necessary. Rather than diverting funds to other areas, governments should continue to support the arts, as they play a vital role in fostering creativity, innovation, and economic growth, as well as enhancing the emotional and mental well-being of their citizens. By doing so, they can create a more balanced, prosperous, and culturally rich society.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The debate about whether the government should cover the costs of healthcare and education has sparked intense discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people argue that it is the government's responsibility to provide these essential services to its citizens. They believe that healthcare and education are fundamental human rights, and that everyone, regardless of their financial situation, should have access to them. By covering these costs, the government can ensure that all citizens have equal opportunities to succeed and live healthy lives.On the other hand, others claim that it is not the government's responsibility to pay for healthcare and education. They argue that these services should be provided by private institutions and individuals should be responsible for covering their own costs. This perspective believes that government intervention can lead to inefficiencies and increased taxes, which can be a burden on the economy. Additionally, they argue that individuals should be free to choose their own healthcare providers and educational institutions, rather than being limited to government-run services.In my opinion, I believe that the government should play a significant role in providing healthcare and education to its citizens. While it is true that government intervention can lead to inefficiencies, I think that the benefits of universal access to healthcare and education far outweigh the costs. A healthy and educated population is essential for a country's economic growth and development. Furthermore, by providing these services, the government can reduce poverty and income inequality, creating a more just and equitable society. Therefore, I think that it is the government's responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to quality healthcare and education, regardless of their financial situation.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The existence of zoos in the 21st century has sparked intense debate, with many arguing that they should no longer keep wild animals in man-made environments. I partially agree with this opinion, as while zoos have made significant contributions to conservation and education, there are also valid concerns regarding animal welfare.On the one hand, zoos play a crucial role in protecting endangered species and promoting conservation efforts. They provide a safe haven for animals that are threatened or extinct in the wild, and offer opportunities for scientists to study and understand animal behavior. Additionally, zoos serve as educational platforms, raising awareness about the importance of conservation and the impact of human activities on wildlife. Many zoos have also evolved to provide naturalistic habitats, mimicking the animals' natural environments, which enhances their well-being.On the other hand, there are concerns that keeping wild animals in captivity can be detrimental to their physical and psychological health. Animals in zoos may exhibit abnormal behaviors, such as pacing or self-mutilation, due to the lack of space and stimulation. Moreover, some zoos prioritize entertainment over animal welfare, and the conditions in which animals are kept can be substandard. These concerns are legitimate and highlight the need for zoos to prioritize animal welfare and adhere to strict standards.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of zoos in conservation and education, I also believe that it is essential to reassess their role in the 21st century. Rather than abolishing zoos entirely, efforts should focus on ensuring that they prioritize animal welfare, provide naturalistic habitats, and contribute to meaningful conservation efforts. By doing so, zoos can continue to serve as valuable educational and conservation tools, while also respecting the needs and rights of the animals in their care.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The notion that environmental degradation is an inevitable consequence of a country's pursuit of a higher standard of living is a topic of ongoing debate. While it is true that industrialization and economic growth can lead to environmental problems, as seen in some industrialized countries, I only partially agree with this statement.On one hand, industrialization and the subsequent improvement in the standard of living often rely on the exploitation of natural resources, as countries seek to increase their economic output. This can result in pollution, as factories and vehicles emit harmful gases, and the destruction of natural habitats, as forests are cleared for urban development and agriculture. For instance, the rapid industrialization of countries like China and the United States has led to severe environmental issues, including air and water pollution, demonstrating that environmental degradation can indeed accompany economic growth.On the other hand, it is not inevitable that environmental damage must occur as a country improves its standard of living. With careful planning, the adoption of sustainable practices, and investment in renewable energy sources, a country can mitigate the negative environmental impacts of industrialization. Many countries, such as those in Scandinavia, have successfully balanced economic growth with environmental protection, demonstrating that it is possible to improve the standard of living without causing significant harm to the environment.In conclusion, while there is a correlation between industrialization, improved standard of living, and environmental problems, it is not an inevitable relationship. With foresight, sustainable practices, and technological innovation, countries can pursue economic growth and environmental protection simultaneously. Therefore, it is possible to disagree with the statement that environmental damage is an inevitable result of improving the standard of living, as there are alternatives and examples that demonstrate a more sustainable path to development.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The notion that the government should prioritize spending on public services and facilities over the arts is a contentious issue. While some people argue that the arts are a luxury the government cannot afford, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, investing in the arts is essential for the well-being and development of a society.Firstly, the arts play a vital role in promoting cultural diversity and preserving national heritage. By funding arts programs, as well as museums and galleries, governments can help preserve historical artifacts and cultural traditions for future generations. This not only enriches our understanding of the past but also fosters a sense of national identity.Secondly, the arts have been shown to have numerous social and economic benefits. They can bring communities together, provide entertainment, and create jobs. In fact, many cities have experienced significant economic growth and revitalization through arts-led regeneration initiatives. Moreover, the arts can also have a positive impact on mental health and education, with studies showing that engagement in artistic activities can improve cognitive skills and reduce stress.Finally, it is shortsighted to view the arts as a luxury that can be sacrificed in times of economic constraint. The arts are an integral part of a society's fabric and contribute to its overall quality of life. By investing in the arts, governments can create a more vibrant, creative, and inclusive society that benefits all citizens.In conclusion, while public services and facilities are undoubtedly important, I firmly believe that the government should also allocate funds to the arts. The benefits of arts investment, from cultural preservation to social and economic development, make it an essential expenditure that can have a lasting and positive impact on society.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;I agree with the statement that animals should be free and people should not keep them in zoos. Keeping animals in zoos is a form of captivity that can be detrimental to their physical and mental well-being. One of the primary reasons is that zoos cannot provide the same natural habitat and space that animals would have in the wild. For instance, elephants in zoos often exhibit abnormal behaviors such as pacing and swaying due to the lack of space and stimulation.Another reason is that zoos often prioritize human entertainment over animal welfare. Many zoos keep animals in small enclosures for the sole purpose of entertaining visitors, which can be stressful and traumatic for the animals. For example, the practice of keeping orcas in seawater parks has been widely criticized due to the cramped and unnatural conditions that these intelligent and social animals are forced to endure.Additionally, keeping animals in zoos can also disrupt their natural social structures and behaviors. In the wild, many animals live in complex societies with their own social hierarchies and behaviors. In zoos, these social structures are often disrupted, leading to abnormal behaviors and stress. For example, the removal of a dominant animal from a group can lead to fighting and instability among the remaining animals.In conclusion, I firmly believe that animals should be free and not kept in zoos. The harm caused by captivity, lack of natural habitat, and disruption of social structures outweigh any potential benefits of keeping animals in zoos. Instead, we should focus on conservation efforts that protect and preserve animals in their natural habitats, allowing them to thrive and live as they were meant to.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;The notion that creative artists should have absolute freedom to express their ideas without any government restrictions is a contentious issue. While I agree that artistic expression is essential for a vibrant and diverse culture, I also believe that some limitations are necessary to prevent harm and ensure social responsibility.On the one hand, artistic freedom allows for the creation of innovative and thought-provoking works that challenge societal norms and inspire critical thinking. Unfettered expression enables artists to push boundaries, explore new ideas, and give voice to marginalized communities. This freedom is essential for the development of art, literature, music, and film, as it fosters creativity, experimentation, and progress.On the other hand, completely unregulated artistic expression can lead to the dissemination of hate speech, obscenity, and harmful content that can cause offense, promote violence, or perpetuate discriminatory attitudes. In such cases, government restrictions can serve as a necessary check to protect vulnerable individuals and maintain social cohesion. For instance, laws against child pornography, hate speech, or incitement to violence are essential to prevent harm and ensure public safety.In conclusion, while I believe that artistic freedom is crucial for creative expression and cultural development, I also think that some government restrictions are necessary to prevent harm and ensure social responsibility. A balanced approach that protects artistic freedom while preventing harm to others is the most appropriate way forward. This can be achieved through laws and regulations that are carefully crafted to promote artistic expression while safeguarding the well-being of society. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility, allowing creative artists to express themselves while minimizing harm to others.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;The omnipresence of advertising in our daily lives has sparked a heated debate about its impact on society. While some argue that advertising has a positive influence, others claim it has a negative effect. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my own opinion.On the one hand, some people believe that advertising is a positive part of our lives. It informs us about new products, services, and ideas, which can improve our lives and provide us with more choices. For instance, advertisements for life-saving medicines or health awareness campaigns can educate people about diseases and their treatments. Additionally, advertising can also promote cultural and social values, such as equality and environmental protection. Many companies use their advertisements to raise awareness about social issues, which can lead to positive changes in society.On the other hand, others argue that advertising has a negative impact. It can be misleading and manipulative, influencing people to buy unnecessary products or services. For example, advertisements for junk food or sugary drinks can contribute to the growing obesity epidemic, especially among children. Furthermore, excessive advertising can also lead to consumerism and materialism, promoting a culture of overconsumption and waste.In my opinion, advertising can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. While it can provide valuable information and promote social values, it can also be misleading and promote overconsumption. Therefore, it is essential to regulate advertising and ensure that it is honest and responsible. By doing so, we can minimize its negative effects and maximize its positive impact. Ultimately, advertising is a powerful tool that can be used to shape our attitudes and behaviors, and it is up to us to use it wisely.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The statement that nuclear power provides clean and cheap energy and that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages is a topic of ongoing debate. On one hand, nuclear power is indeed a clean source of energy as it does not produce greenhouse gases or other harmful emissions during operation, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels in the fight against climate change. Additionally, nuclear energy is a reliable and constant source of power, unlike solar or wind energy which are intermittent.On the other hand, the disadvantages of nuclear power cannot be overlooked. One of the major drawbacks is the production of radioactive waste, which remains hazardous for thousands of years and poses significant challenges for storage and disposal. Furthermore, nuclear accidents, such as those at Chernobyl and Fukushima, have highlighted the catastrophic risks associated with nuclear power generation. These incidents not only cause immediate harm to human health and the environment but also have long-term consequences.Moreover, while the cost of generating electricity from nuclear power can be relatively low once a plant is operational, the initial construction costs are extremely high, and the cost of decommissioning at the end of a plant's life must also be factored into the overall expense. In conclusion, although nuclear power has its advantages, including providing a clean and reliable source of energy, the disadvantages, particularly the risks associated with nuclear waste and accidents, cannot be ignored. Therefore, I disagree that the advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. A more balanced approach, considering all forms of energy production and their respective benefits and drawbacks, is necessary for a sustainable energy future.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;The notion that the government should provide every unemployed person with a mobile phone and ensure access to the Internet has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this is an effective way to utilize public funds to alleviate unemployment, I only partially agree with this stance.On the one hand, providing mobile phones and Internet access can be beneficial for job seekers. It enables them to stay connected with potential employers, receive job alerts, and access online job portals. Moreover, the Internet offers a wealth of information on job training, resume building, and career development, which can be invaluable for those seeking employment. By bridging the digital divide, the government can empower unemployed individuals to actively pursue job opportunities and enhance their employability.On the other hand, I disagree that providing mobile phones and Internet access is the most effective use of public money to reduce unemployment. Other initiatives such as vocational training programs, education, and job creation schemes may have a more direct and significant impact on reducing unemployment rates. Furthermore, the cost of implementing and maintaining such a program could be substantial, and it may not be feasible for governments with limited budgets.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of providing mobile phones and Internet access to unemployed individuals, I believe that this measure should be part of a broader strategy to address unemployment. The government should prioritize initiatives that directly create jobs, enhance skills, and foster economic growth, and then supplement these efforts with programs that promote digital inclusion. By adopting a multi-faceted approach, the government can more effectively utilize public funds to combat unemployment.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;The widespread installation of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in public areas has sparked a heated debate about their impact on society. On one hand, proponents argue that CCTV cameras are an effective tool in the fight against crime, as they can deter potential offenders and aid in the identification and prosecution of criminals. The presence of these cameras can make the public feel safer, particularly in high-crime areas or at night. Furthermore, CCTV footage can serve as valuable evidence in investigations, helping to solve crimes and bring perpetrators to justice.On the other hand, opponents of CCTV cameras argue that they infringe upon individuals' right to privacy. They believe that the constant surveillance is an invasion of personal space and can lead to a sense of mistrust among the public. Moreover, there are concerns about who has access to the footage and how it is used, raising questions about potential misuse or abuse. Some also argue that the funds spent on installing and maintaining CCTV cameras could be better allocated to other crime prevention strategies, such as community policing or social programs aimed at addressing the root causes of crime.In my view, while the right to privacy is fundamental, the benefits of CCTV cameras in enhancing public safety and reducing crime outweigh the concerns about privacy. However, it is crucial that strict guidelines and regulations are in place to ensure that CCTV cameras are used responsibly and that the footage is handled and stored securely to prevent misuse. Transparency about the locations and purposes of CCTV cameras, as well as regular audits to ensure their effective and ethical use, can also help to alleviate privacy concerns. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both public safety and individual rights is necessary to make the most out of CCTV technology.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the city provides more opportunities and exposure, I firmly believe that growing up in the countryside is more beneficial for children.One of the primary advantages of growing up in the countryside is the cleaner and healthier environment. The air and water are fresher, and the pace of life is slower, which can lead to a more relaxed and peaceful childhood. In contrast, cities are often plagued by pollution, noise, and crowds, which can be overwhelming and stressful for young children. Additionally, the countryside provides ample space for children to play and explore, allowing them to develop a stronger connection with nature and engage in physical activities.Another significant benefit of growing up in the countryside is the stronger sense of community. Rural areas often have a closer-knit community where neighbors know and look out for each other, providing a safer and more supportive environment for children to grow and thrive. Furthermore, the countryside offers a more simplistic and traditional way of life, which can help children develop important life skills such as self-sufficiency and resourcefulness.In conclusion, while cities may offer more amenities and opportunities, I believe that growing up in the countryside is better for children. The cleaner environment, stronger sense of community, and more relaxed pace of life all contribute to a healthier and happier childhood. As such, I strongly agree that the countryside is a more suitable place for children to grow and develop into capable and well-rounded individuals.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The age-old debate about whether to work for a company or to venture into business for oneself has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals prefer the stability and security that comes with being employed by a company, others believe that being their own boss is the key to success and happiness. In my opinion, going into business for oneself is the better option.On one hand, working for a company provides a sense of security and stability. Employees receive a regular paycheck, benefits, and a clear career path. However, this stability often comes at the cost of creativity, autonomy, and potential for growth. Employees are often limited in their ability to make decisions and take risks, which can stifle innovation and progress.On the other hand, going into business for oneself offers unparalleled freedom and flexibility. Entrepreneurs have the ability to pursue their passions, make their own decisions, and reap the rewards of their hard work. While the road to success may be paved with uncertainty and risk, the potential for growth and return on investment is exponentially higher. Moreover, entrepreneurs have the opportunity to create jobs, contribute to their community, and leave a lasting legacy.Furthermore, being one's own boss allows for a better work-life balance and greater job satisfaction. Without the constraints of a 9-to-5 job, entrepreneurs can create a schedule that suits their needs and priorities. Additionally, the sense of accomplishment and pride that comes with building a successful business is unmatched.In conclusion, while working for a company has its benefits, I firmly believe that going into business for oneself is the better option. The freedom, flexibility, and potential for growth that comes with entrepreneurship far outweigh the stability and security of being employed. With great risk comes great reward, and for those willing to take the leap, the rewards can be limitless.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" is a motivational mantra that has been echoed by numerous successful individuals throughout history. It emphasizes the importance of perseverance and persistence in achieving one's goals. I strongly agree with this statement, as giving up can lead to missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.When faced with obstacles and setbacks, it is easy to feel discouraged and consider giving up. However, the reality is that every successful person has experienced failures and setbacks at some point in their journey. Thomas Edison, for instance, is famously known for saying ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His persistence and refusal to give up ultimately led to the invention of the light bulb.Giving up can also lead to a sense of regret and ""what ifs."" Imagine if J.K. Rowling had given up on her Harry Potter manuscript after being rejected by numerous publishers. The world would have been deprived of a beloved book series that has inspired millions of readers. By persisting and continuing to work towards their goals, individuals can overcome even the most daunting challenges and achieve greatness.In conclusion, the expression ""Never, never give up"" is a powerful reminder that success often requires perseverance and determination. By adopting this mindset, individuals can overcome obstacles, achieve their goals, and reach their full potential. As the famous poet Maya Angelou once said, ""You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them."" Therefore, I firmly believe that never giving up is essential to achieving success and living a fulfilling life."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The debate surrounding the preservation of land for endangered animals versus human needs for farmland, housing, and industry has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that human necessities take precedence over conservation efforts, I firmly disagree with this viewpoint.On one hand, the demands for farmland, housing, and industry are undoubtedly crucial for human survival and economic growth. However, prioritizing these needs over the preservation of endangered species can have severe and irreversible consequences. The loss of biodiversity can disrupt delicate ecosystems, leading to catastrophic effects on the environment, climate, and ultimately, human well-being.On the other hand, preserving land for endangered animals is not only a moral obligation, but also essential for maintaining ecological balance. These species play a vital role in maintaining the health of ecosystems, and their loss can have far-reaching and devastating consequences. Furthermore, many endangered species have the potential to provide groundbreaking medical and scientific discoveries, which could greatly benefit humanity.Rather than pitting human needs against conservation, I believe that a balanced approach can be adopted. Sustainable development and innovative technologies can help minimize the impact of human activities on the environment, allowing for the coexistence of farmland, housing, and industry with protected areas for endangered species. Governments, organizations, and individuals must work together to establish and maintain nature reserves, implement conservation policies, and promote eco-friendly practices.In conclusion, while human needs are essential, I strongly disagree that they should take precedence over saving land for endangered animals. The preservation of biodiversity is not only a moral duty, but also crucial for the long-term sustainability of our planet. By adopting a balanced and sustainable approach, we can ensure the well-being of both humans and the natural world.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"The age-old adage ""never judge a person by external appearance"" is a timeless wisdom that still holds relevance today. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as it emphasizes the importance of looking beyond a person's physical appearance to truly understand their character, abilities, and worth.Judging someone based on their external appearance can lead to misconceptions and misunderstandings. A person's physical attributes, such as their height, weight, or facial features, do not necessarily reflect their intelligence, kindness, or talents. Moreover, people from different cultural backgrounds may have distinct physical characteristics that should not be misinterpreted as inferior or superior.History is replete with examples of individuals who were underestimated or misunderstood due to their appearance, only to prove others wrong. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most brilliant minds in history, was known for his disheveled hair and worn-out clothes. If people had judged him based on his appearance, they would have missed out on the opportunity to learn from his groundbreaking theories.Furthermore, judging people based on their appearance can lead to discrimination, prejudice, and social exclusion. It is essential to recognize that every individual has a unique story, experiences, and perspectives that cannot be captured by their physical appearance. By looking beyond the surface level, we can foster a more inclusive, empathetic, and compassionate society.In conclusion, it is crucial to remember that a person's worth and character cannot be measured by their external appearance. We should strive to get to know individuals as they truly are, beyond their physical attributes. By doing so, we can break down social barriers, build meaningful relationships, and create a more harmonious and accepting community. Ultimately, never judging a person by external appearance is a vital principle that can help us appreciate the diversity and richness of human experience."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The debate about whether there should be a single international language has sparked intense discussion among linguists, cultural enthusiasts, and globalization proponents. While some argue that a universal language would facilitate global communication and unity, others contend that it would lead to cultural homogenization and loss of identity. In my opinion, having a single international language would undermine the rich cultural diversity that exists across the globe.On one hand, a universal language would undoubtedly simplify international interactions, as people from different countries could communicate effortlessly. This would be particularly beneficial in fields like business, science, and diplomacy, where clear communication is crucial. Moreover, it would facilitate the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and cultures, thereby promoting global understanding and cooperation.On the other hand, the adoption of a single international language would pose a significant threat to the preservation of cultural identities. Language is an integral part of a culture's heritage, and its loss would inevitably lead to the erosion of traditions, customs, and values. The unique linguistic characteristics, idioms, and expressions that make a culture distinct would be lost, as people would increasingly rely on the universal language. This would result in a monotonous cultural landscape, where the diversity and complexity that make human experience so rich and fascinating would be reduced to a bland, uniform entity.In conclusion, while a single international language may have its advantages, I firmly believe that the preservation of cultural identities and linguistic diversity is essential. Instead of imposing a universal language, we should strive to promote language learning and cultural exchange, allowing people to appreciate and respect the diversity of languages and cultures that exist worldwide. By doing so, we can foster global understanding and cooperation while preserving the rich tapestry of human cultures.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The world of fashion is ever-evolving, with new trends emerging every season. However, it has become increasingly challenging to keep up with these trends, and many believe that they are merely a ploy to sell clothes. In my opinion, I agree that we should not blindly follow fashion trends and instead, dress in what makes us feel confident and comfortable.On one hand, following fashion trends can be seen as a form of self-expression and a way to showcase one's personality. It can also be a fun and exciting way to stay updated with the latest styles and must-haves. Nevertheless, the pressure to constantly keep up with the latest trends can be overwhelming and lead to a sense of superficiality. The emphasis on material possessions and the need to constantly purchase new clothes can also have a negative impact on the environment and our wallets.On the other hand, dressing in what we like allows us to develop our own unique sense of style and express ourselves in a more authentic way. It also promotes sustainability, as we are not constantly feeling the need to purchase new clothes to keep up with the trends. Furthermore, it allows us to focus on what truly matters, such as our comfort, confidence, and individuality. By dressing in what we like, we are also sending a message that we value our own opinions and tastes over the dictates of the fashion industry.In conclusion, while following fashion trends can be a fun and creative outlet, I believe that it is more important to dress in what makes us feel confident and comfortable. By doing so, we promote sustainability, individuality, and a more authentic sense of self-expression. Ultimately, fashion should be a means of self-expression, not a source of stress or pressure to conform.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate over whether wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer nations has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, providing food and education to impoverished countries can be seen as a moral obligation, as it can greatly alleviate human suffering and promote global stability. Wealthy nations have a significant surplus of resources, and sharing them with those in need can be a powerful tool in reducing poverty and inequality. Furthermore, providing education can empower individuals and communities, enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and become self-sufficient.On the other hand, some argue that it is the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves. This perspective suggests that wealthy nations should not be expected to solve the problems of other countries, and that each nation should be accountable for its own development. Moreover, providing aid without ensuring good governance and effective institutions can create dependency and undermine the incentives for local leaders to implement necessary reforms.However, a balanced approach can be taken, where wealthy nations provide targeted assistance while also supporting the development of local capacities and institutions. This can include investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, as well as promoting trade and economic cooperation. Ultimately, the responsibility for a nation's development lies with its government, but wealthy nations can play a crucial role in supporting and supplementing these efforts. By working together and sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for all. Wealthy nations can make a significant difference in the lives of millions of people, and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to the basic necessities of life.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The allocation of a country's health budget is a critical decision that can have far-reaching consequences for the well-being of its citizens. The statement suggests that a significant proportion of the health budget should be diverted from treatment to health education and preventative measures. I largely agree with this statement, as investing in health education and prevention can have long-term benefits for the health and wellbeing of a population.Treatment of illnesses and diseases is essential, but it is often a costly and reactive approach to healthcare. In contrast, health education and preventative measures can help to reduce the incidence of diseases and illnesses, thereby reducing the demand for treatment. By educating the public about healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their health. This approach can lead to a significant reduction in healthcare costs and a decrease in the burden on the healthcare system.Furthermore, preventative measures such as vaccination programs, screening tests, and health checks can help to detect and prevent diseases at an early stage, reducing the need for costly treatments. For example, vaccination programs have been instrumental in controlling and eliminating infectious diseases such as smallpox and polio. By investing in health education and preventative measures, a country can promote a culture of health and wellbeing, leading to a healthier and more productive population.However, it is also important to note that treatment should not be completely neglected. A balance needs to be struck between investing in health education and preventative measures, and providing adequate treatment options for those who require them. Ultimately, a well-allocated health budget should prioritize both prevention and treatment to ensure that citizens have access to comprehensive and effective healthcare.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;"The rise of news media has undoubtedly become a pervasive aspect of modern life, and its impact on individuals is a subject of considerable debate. While some argue that the popularity of news media has a detrimental effect on people's lives, I tend to disagree with this notion.On the one hand, it is true that excessive exposure to news media can lead to a phenomenon known as ""compassion fatigue,"" where individuals become desensitized to the plight of others due to the constant bombardment of negative news. Furthermore, news outlets often prioritize sensationalism over factual reporting, which can create unnecessary anxiety and stress among viewers. However, these drawbacks can be mitigated by responsible media consumption and a critical approach to news analysis.On the other hand, the benefits of a well-informed and engaged citizenry far outweigh the potential drawbacks. News media plays a crucial role in holding those in power accountable, providing a platform for marginalized voices, and facilitating public discourse on pressing issues. By staying informed about current events, individuals can make more informed decisions, engage in meaningful conversations, and participate in the democratic process. Moreover, the diversity of perspectives and opinions presented in the news media can foster empathy, tolerance, and a deeper understanding of the complexities of the world.In conclusion, while it is essential to acknowledge the potential pitfalls of news media, I firmly believe that its popularity has a net positive impact on people's lives. By promoting media literacy, critical thinking, and responsible consumption, individuals can harness the power of news media to become more engaged, informed, and active members of society. Ultimately, a well-informed and discerning public is essential for the health of democracy and the betterment of society as a whole."
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;The practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in a criminal case is a long-standing principle in British and Australian laws. The primary purpose of this practice is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial, and that the jury's decision is based solely on the evidence presented in the current case. I strongly disagree with the suggestion that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given access to a defendant's past criminal record.Allowing a jury to know about a defendant's past crimes could lead to prejudice and bias, potentially influencing their decision. The jury's role is to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty based on the evidence presented, and not to punish them for past misdeeds. If a jury is aware of a defendant's past record, they may be more likely to assume guilt, even if the evidence in the current case is not conclusive. This could result in wrongful convictions and undermine the integrity of the justice system.Furthermore, a defendant's past record is not always relevant to the current case, and may not provide a complete picture of their character or behavior. By withholding this information, the jury is forced to focus on the facts of the current case, and make a decision based on the evidence presented. This ensures that justice is served, and that the defendant receives a fair trial. In conclusion, the current practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury is an essential aspect of a fair trial, and should not be changed. It protects the rights of the accused and ensures that justice is served based on the evidence, rather than on past mistakes or misdeeds.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;The notion that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions play a crucial role in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. While some argue that these events bring people together and foster global unity, I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, these events do provide a platform for nations to come together,On the other hand, these events can also exacerbate existing tensions and create new ones. The intense rivalry and competitive nature of these events can lead to an increase in nationalist sentiments,In conclusion, popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions have both positive and negative effects on international tensions and patriotic emotions.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;The issue of children engaging in paid work is a contentious one, with opinions divided on its merits. While some people vehemently oppose the idea, citing exploitation and harm to the child's well-being, others see it as a valuable learning experience that teaches responsibility and important life skills. In my opinion, the question of whether children should be engaged in paid work depends on the nature and context of the work.On the one hand, it is undeniable that some forms of paid work can be detrimental to a child's physical, emotional, and educational development. Children who are forced to work long hours in hazardous or exploitative conditions can suffer from physical harm, psychological trauma, and missed educational opportunities. This is clearly unacceptable and should be strongly condemned.On the other hand, not all paid work is created equal. Some forms of work, such as part-time jobs or internships, can provide children with valuable skills, experience, and a sense of responsibility. These opportunities can help children develop important life skills, such as time management, teamwork, and financial literacy, while also supplementing their education with practical, real-world experience.Ultimately, the key to resolving this debate lies in striking a balance between protecting children's rights and providing them with valuable learning experiences. Governments, employers, and parents must work together to ensure that any paid work undertaken by children is safe, regulated, and complementary to their education. By doing so, we can help children develop into capable, responsible, and productive members of society, while also protecting them from exploitation and harm.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;The trend of taking a gap year between completing high school and commencing university studies has gained popularity worldwide. This break allows young individuals to work, travel, or engage in other activities that foster personal growth and development. While there are advantages to taking a gap year, there are also some disadvantages that need to be considered.On the positive side, taking a gap year can provide young people with invaluable life experiences and skills. By working, they can gain practical knowledge, develop a sense of responsibility, and earn money to support their future university expenses. Travelling, on the other hand, broadens their cultural understanding, exposes them to diverse ways of life, and enhances their independence. Additionally, a gap year can give students time to reflect on their academic and career goals, potentially leading to a more focused and motivated approach to their university studies.However, there are also potential downsides to taking a gap year. One of the main concerns is that it may disrupt the momentum of academic learning, leading to a decrease in study habits and retention of knowledge gained in high school. Furthermore, delaying university entrance might put students at a disadvantage compared to their peers who enroll immediately, especially in competitive fields where an early start can be beneficial. Moreover, not all gap year activities are productive or safe, and some young people might find themselves in unsuitable or even risky situations.In conclusion, while taking a gap year can offer numerous benefits such as personal growth, practical experience, and financial support, it also comes with potential drawbacks including academic disruption and competitive disadvantage. Ultimately, the decision to take a gap year should be based on individual circumstances and goals, ensuring that the experience is utilized to enhance future academic and professional success.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;The idea that the qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution is a topic of ongoing debate. While I acknowledge that academic institutions provide a solid foundation for knowledge and skills, I partially agree that success requires qualities that go beyond the realm of academia.Universities and colleges equip students with theoretical knowledge, a strong work ethic, and critical thinking skills, all of which are essential for success. However, qualities like adaptability, resilience, creativity, and effective communication are equally crucial in today's fast-paced and ever-changing world. These soft skills, which are often gained through real-world experiences, internships, and personal interactions, cannot be fully replicated within the confines of a classroom.Moreover, entrepreneurial spirit, emotional intelligence, and the ability to navigate uncertainty are essential qualities for achieving success, particularly in the context of innovation and leadership. These traits are often developed through hands-on experiences, networking, and learning from failures, which may not be adequately addressed in traditional academic settings. Nonetheless, it is also important to recognize that academic institutions can provide a platform for students to develop some of these qualities, such as through project-based learning, group assignments, and extracurricular activities. Therefore, while universities can lay the groundwork, it is the combination of academic learning with practical, real-world experiences that truly fosters the wide range of qualities needed for success in today's world. In conclusion, I believe that while academic institutions play a vital role, they are only one part of the equation for achieving success, and real-world experiences are equally, if not more, important.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;The notion of forced retirement at a specific age has been a long-standing debate. While some argue that it is necessary to create job opportunities for younger generations, I firmly believe that people should be allowed to continue working for as long as they want to. Mandatory retirement ages, such as 60 or 65, can be detrimental to individuals who are still capable and willing to contribute to the workforce.Forcing people to retire can lead to a loss of skilled and experienced workers, which can be particularly detrimental to industries that require specialized knowledge and expertise. Furthermore, many people rely on their employment not only for financial stability but also for social interaction and a sense of purpose. Retiring earlier than desired can lead to feelings of isolation and boredom, ultimately affecting their mental and physical health.On the other hand, allowing people to work for as long as they want to can have numerous benefits. It can lead to a more experienced and skilled workforce, as well as increased economic activity. Many older workers are also willing to mentor and train younger employees, which can help to transfer knowledge and skills to the next generation. Additionally, with the rising cost of living and increasing life expectancy, many people may not have enough savings to support themselves in retirement, and continuing to work can provide them with a much-needed income.In conclusion, I strongly agree that people should be allowed to continue working for as long as they want to. It is essential to recognize the value and contributions that older workers can bring to the workforce and to provide them with the opportunity to continue working if they so desire. By doing so, we can create a more diverse, experienced, and skilled workforce that benefits both individuals and society as a whole.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The notion that public museums and art galleries will become obsolete due to the rise of digital technology has sparked a heated debate. While it is true that computers and the internet have made it possible for people to access and view historical objects and artworks from the comfort of their own homes, I strongly disagree that this will render physical museums and galleries unnecessary.On the one hand, digital technology has undoubtedly increased accessibility to cultural and historical content. With just a few clicks, people can now explore exhibitions and view artworks from around the world. This has been particularly beneficial for those with mobility issues or living in remote areas. However, the experience of viewing a digital representation of an artwork or historical object is fundamentally different from seeing it in person.On the other hand, physical museums and galleries offer a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated by digital technology. The texture, scale, and context of an artwork or historical object are essential to understanding its significance and impact. Moreover, museums and galleries provide a social and communal space where people can engage with others, share experiences, and participate in guided tours and workshops. The sensory and emotional connections that people make with physical objects and artworks are essential to fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of culture and history.In conclusion, while digital technology has expanded access to cultural and historical content, it is unlikely to replace the need for physical museums and art galleries. The unique experience and benefits offered by these institutions ensure that they will continue to be relevant and necessary, providing a space for people to engage with and appreciate the richness and diversity of human culture and history.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;"The practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in a criminal case is a long-standing principle in British and Australian laws. The primary purpose of this practice is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial, untainted by prejudicial information. I strongly disagree with the suggestion that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.If a jury is aware of a defendant's past criminal record, it is likely to influence their decision, potentially leading to an unfair outcome. The jury's role is to determine whether the defendant is guilty of the specific crime they are being tried for, not to punish them for past transgressions. By keeping the defendant's past record hidden, the jury can focus on the evidence presented in the current case, rather than being swayed by irrelevant information.Furthermore, introducing a defendant's past record into the trial could lead to a ""guilty by association"" mentality, where the jury assumes the defendant is guilty based on their past behavior, rather than the evidence presented. This would undermine the fundamental principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and could result in wrongful convictions.In conclusion, the current practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury is essential to ensuring a fair trial. It allows the jury to focus on the evidence presented in the case, rather than being influenced by irrelevant and potentially prejudicial information. Changing this practice could lead to unfair outcomes and undermine the integrity of the justice system. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the suggestion that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case."
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way education is delivered, and university lecturers are now able to post their lectures online for students to access. This has led to a reduction in the importance of attending face-to-face lectures, and has sparked debate about the role of the internet in formal education. In my opinion, the use of the internet in formal education is a good idea, and it has both positive and negative effects on future academic study.On the one hand, the internet provides students with unparalleled access to educational resources, allowing them to learn at their own pace and review material as many times as they need. This is particularly beneficial for students who may have missed a lecture or need to reinforce their understanding of complex concepts. Additionally, online lectures can reach a wider audience, increasing accessibility and equality in education.On the other hand, over-reliance on online lectures can lead to a lack of engagement and interaction with instructors and peers, which are essential components of the learning process. Face-to-face lectures provide opportunities for discussion, debate, and clarification, which are difficult to replicate online. Moreover, the absence of non-verbal cues and immediate feedback can hinder the learning experience.In conclusion, while the internet has reduced the importance of attending face-to-face lectures, it is not a replacement for traditional teaching methods. A balanced approach, combining online resources with face-to-face interaction, is likely to yield the best results. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to harness its potential to enhance, rather than replace, the academic experience. By doing so, we can ensure that future academic study is enriched, and students are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in an increasingly digital world.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The disparity in access to medication between developed and undeveloped countries is a pressing global issue. Millions of people in impoverished nations succumb to curable diseases due to the unaffordability of life-saving medications. It is morally imperative to consider the role of drug companies in bridging this healthcare gap. In my opinion, drug companies in the developed world have a social responsibility to make their products available at reduced prices in undeveloped countries.By doing so, these companies can help prevent unnecessary deaths and alleviate the burden of treatable diseases on vulnerable populations. The argument that reducing prices would compromise research and development investments is valid, but it does not justify the loss of human lives. A balanced approach, where companies maintain their profitability while also ensuring accessibility of their medications, can be achieved through tiered pricing models or partnerships with governments and non-profit organizations.Moreover, making medications affordable in undeveloped countries can have long-term benefits for drug companies, including expanding their market reach and fostering goodwill. It is also important to recognize that the current situation is not only a humanitarian crisis but also a significant economic burden, as the loss of productive members of society can hinder a country's development. Therefore, I firmly believe that drug companies should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in undeveloped countries, as it is a matter of social justice and a crucial step towards achieving global health equity. By taking this step, we can work towards a future where access to lifesaving medication is a fundamental right, not a privilege reserved for the affluent.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The issue of smoking in public places and offices has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that individuals have the right to smoke wherever they please, I firmly agree that smoking should be prohibited in all public places and offices.First and foremost, smoking poses serious health risks not only to the smoker but also to those around them. Second-hand smoke, also known as passive smoke, has been proven to cause a range of health problems, including lung cancer and heart disease. By banning smoking in public places and offices, governments and businesses can help protect the health of their citizens and employees.Furthermore, smoking can be a significant distraction and disruption in the workplace. The smell of smoke can be unpleasant and irritating to non-smokers, and the frequent breaks that smokers take to smoke can decrease productivity and efficiency. In addition, smoking can also damage property and leave unpleasant odors and stains.Moreover, banning smoking in public places and offices can help to reduce the number of smokers and prevent young people from taking up the habit. If smoking is not allowed in public, it can help to de-normalize the behavior and make it less appealing to others. This can have long-term health benefits for individuals and society as a whole.In conclusion, while some may argue that smoking bans infringe upon individual rights, I firmly believe that the benefits of prohibiting smoking in public places and offices far outweigh any perceived drawbacks. By protecting the health of citizens and employees, and promoting a healthier and more productive environment, governments and businesses can make a positive impact on society. Therefore, I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in all public places and offices.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";The debate about the impact of human activities on the Earth has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that our actions are enhancing the quality of life on the planet, I firmly believe that humans are harming the Earth through our activities.The evidence of environmental degradation is overwhelming. Deforestation, pollution, climate change, and species extinction are just a few examples of the devastating consequences of human actions. The excessive use of fossil fuels, for instance, has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in rising temperatures and more frequent natural disasters. Moreover, the rampant pollution of our oceans and waterways has not only harmed marine life but also contaminated the food chain, posing a significant threat to human health.On the other hand, some may argue that human activities have improved the quality of life on Earth by providing better infrastructure, technology, and healthcare. However, these advancements come at a steep environmental cost. The production and disposal of technology, for example, contribute to electronic waste and pollution, while the expansion of infrastructure often leads to habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity.In conclusion, the harm caused by human activities to the Earth far outweighs any perceived benefits. It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the damage and adopt sustainable practices to preserve the planet for future generations. This can be achieved through a collective effort to reduce our carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, and protect endangered species. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that our actions do not irreparably harm the planet, but rather contribute to its preservation and prosperity.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The idea that companies should encourage high-level employees over 55 to retire to give opportunities to new generations is a contentious issue. While some argue that this approach can inject fresh perspectives and ideas into a company, I disagree with this stance.On one hand, it is true that retiring older employees can create vacancies, allowing younger talent to step up and take on new challenges. This can lead to innovation and diversity in the workplace, as new generations bring unique experiences and skills to the table. However, this approach overlooks the value and contributions that experienced employees can continue to make.On the other hand, older employees often possess valuable knowledge, expertise, and leadership skills, honed over years of service. Forcing them into retirement can result in a significant loss of institutional memory and mentorship opportunities. Many older employees are still highly productive and motivated, and their experience can be instrumental in guiding and training younger colleagues. Moreover, with the increasing lifespan and health of the population, many people over 55 are still capable of making significant contributions to their organizations.Rather than encouraging retirement, companies should focus on creating a work environment that values and utilizes the skills of all employees, regardless of age. This can involve providing opportunities for knowledge transfer, mentoring, and flexible work arrangements that cater to different stages of life. By embracing age diversity and promoting intergenerational collaboration, companies can leverage the strengths of both older and younger employees, and create a more dynamic and successful organization. In conclusion, while the intention behind encouraging older employees to retire may be to give opportunities to new generations, it is not a strategy that I agree with.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The debate surrounding media control has been a longstanding one, with some advocating for stricter regulations and others pushing for greater freedom of access to information. After careful consideration, I firmly believe that controls on the media should be loosened to provide people with freer access to information.On one hand, a completely unregulated media landscape can lead to the dissemination of false or misleading information, as well as the exploitation of sensitive or explicit content. However, I believe that the benefits of a more open media system far outweigh the potential drawbacks. By loosening controls, people are granted unhindered access to a wide range of information, allowing them to make informed decisions and engage in thoughtful discussions.Moreover, strict media controls can often be used as a tool for censorship, stifling dissenting voices and limiting the exchange of ideas. In a democratic society, the free flow of information is essential for holding those in power accountable and promoting transparency. By giving people greater access to information, we empower them to participate in the democratic process and contribute to the development of a more informed and engaged citizenry.Ultimately, while some regulation may be necessary to prevent the spread of harmful or explicit content, I believe that the media should be subject to minimal control. By trusting people to discern and critically evaluate the information presented to them, we can foster a more open, informed, and democratic society. Loosening controls on the media is essential for promoting freedom of expression, access to information, and the exchange of ideas, all of which are fundamental to a healthy and functioning democracy.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The notion that paying taxes is sufficient to contribute to society has sparked a debate among individuals. While some people believe that fulfilling tax obligations is enough, others argue that being a citizen entails more responsibilities. In my opinion, I agree with the latter viewpoint.Paying taxes is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of being a citizen, as it helps fund public services and infrastructure. However, it is merely one facet of the broader spectrum of civic responsibilities. Citizens have a moral obligation to engage with their community, participate in the democratic process, and contribute to the well-being of society. This can be achieved through volunteering, community service, and active participation in local governance.Moreover, being an informed and responsible citizen involves staying updated on current events, critically evaluating information, and making informed decisions. It also entails respecting the rights and dignity of fellow citizens, promoting social cohesion, and advocating for the common good. By adopting these values, citizens can create a more harmonious and equitable society.In conclusion, while paying taxes is an essential duty of citizenship, it is by no means the only responsibility. Being a citizen involves a multifaceted commitment to the community, the environment, and the democratic process. As responsible citizens, we must strive to go beyond merely fulfilling our tax obligations and actively engage with our community to create a better world for future generations. By doing so, we can foster a sense of shared ownership and collective responsibility, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and harmonious society. Ultimately, being a citizen is not just about paying taxes, but about embracing a broader range of responsibilities that contribute to the greater good.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The debate on whether testing on animals should be made illegal has been a contentious issue for many years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that testing on animals should be made illegal. The use of animals in scientific research and product testing is a cruel and inhumane practice that raises serious ethical concerns.Firstly, animal testing is often unnecessary and unreliable. Many alternative methods, such as computer simulations and human clinical trials, can provide more accurate and relevant results. Furthermore, the use of animals in testing can lead to false or misleading results, as animals may react differently to substances than humans do. This can result in the development of ineffective or even harmful treatments.Moreover, animal testing is a barbaric practice that causes immense suffering and harm to innocent animals. Every year, millions of animals are subjected to painful and distressing procedures, including toxicity testing, skin and eye irritation tests, and lethal dose tests. These animals are often kept in inhumane conditions, without adequate food, water, or shelter, and are eventually killed at the end of the testing process.In addition, there are many examples of successful alternatives to animal testing that have already been developed. For instance, many cosmetics companies have switched to using in vitro testing methods, which use human skin cells in a laboratory to test the safety and efficacy of their products. Similarly, many pharmaceutical companies are now using computer simulations and human clinical trials to test new drugs, rather than relying on animal models.In conclusion, testing on animals is an outdated, cruel, and unnecessary practice that should be made illegal. With the development of alternative methods, there is no longer a need to subject animals to painful and distressing procedures. It is our moral obligation to treat animals with respect and kindness, and to protect them from harm and exploitation.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"The effectiveness of formal ""pen and paper"" examinations as a means of assessing educational achievement has been a topic of debate for a long time. While some people believe that examinations are a necessary evil, others argue that they are not the best method of evaluation. In my view, the traditional examination system has several drawbacks that make it an outdated and inefficient way of assessing students' knowledge and skills.One of the main criticisms of examinations is that they only test a student's ability to memorize and recall information, rather than their understanding and application of it. This can lead to a narrow focus on rote learning, rather than encouraging critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, examinations can be a source of significant stress and anxiety for students, which can negatively impact their performance and overall well-being.Another limitation of examinations is that they do not account for individual differences in learning styles and abilities. Some students may excel in a traditional exam setting, while others may struggle, despite having a deep understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, examinations often prioritize theoretical knowledge over practical skills, which can make it difficult for students to apply what they have learned in real-world situations.In conclusion, while examinations have been a staple of the educational system for centuries, they are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. They prioritize memorization over understanding, create unnecessary stress, and fail to account for individual differences in learning styles. Alternative assessment methods, such as project-based evaluations and competency-based progression, should be explored to provide a more comprehensive and effective way of evaluating student learning. By moving away from traditional examinations, we can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that allows students to reach their full potential."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of poorer nations is a pressing concern that requires a multifaceted approach. Improvements in health, education, and trade are indeed essential for the growth and prosperity of these nations. However, it is crucial that the governments of richer nations take a more active role in supporting their less fortunate counterparts in these areas.Health and education are the foundation upon which a nation's development is built. In poorer nations, these sectors are often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of access to basic healthcare and quality education. The governments of richer nations can make a significant impact by providing financial assistance, donating medical supplies and equipment, and sending medical professionals and educators to share their expertise. This not only improves the health and education outcomes in poorer nations but also helps to build a skilled and productive workforce.Trade is another critical area where richer nations can offer support. By reducing trade barriers and providing preferential market access, richer nations can help poorer nations to increase their exports and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, richer nations can share their knowledge and technology to help poorer nations develop their infrastructure and industries. This can include investing in transportation systems, communication networks, and energy production, which are essential for economic development.In conclusion, the development of poorer nations requires a collaborative effort from the international community. The governments of richer nations have a moral obligation to assist their less fortunate counterparts in improving health,,assistanteducation, and trade. By providing financial and technical assistance, richer nations can help poorer nations to break the cycle of poverty and achieve sustainable development. It is essential that richer nations take a more proactive approach to supporting poorer nations, not only as a moral imperative but also as a sound investment in global stability and prosperity. By working together, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for all nations.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;The increasing use of computers in education has sparked a debate about the future role of teachers in the classroom. While some argue that computers will eventually replace teachers, I strongly disagree. Computers are excellent tools for supplementing learning, but they lack the human touch and interpersonal skills that teachers bring to the classroom.Computers can provide students with access to a vast amount of information and educational resources, but they cannot replace the guidance, support, and feedback that teachers offer. Teachers play a crucial role in helping students understand complex concepts, answering questions, and providing individualized attention. They also help students develop important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are essential for success in the real world.Furthermore, teaching is not just about imparting knowledge, but also about inspiring, motivating, and mentoring students. Teachers have the ability to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment, which is essential for students' emotional and social development. Computers, on the other hand, are limited in their ability to provide emotional support and empathy, which are essential for students' well-being and academic success.In conclusion, while computers will continue to play an increasingly important role in education, they will not replace teachers in the classroom. Teachers bring a unique set of skills, experience, and human qualities that are essential for providing high-quality education. Rather than replacing teachers, computers will augment their role, allowing them to focus on what they do best: providing individualized support, guidance, and inspiration to students. Ultimately, the effective use of computers in education will enhance the teaching process, but it will not make teachers redundant.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The use of improved fertilisers and better machinery in food production has sparked a debate about the trade-offs between cost efficiency and potential risks to human health and local communities. On one hand, the implementation of modern agricultural techniques can significantly reduce production costs, making food more affordable and accessible to a wider population. This is particularly beneficial for low-income households and individuals who struggle to make ends meet.On the other hand, the use of certain fertilisers and machinery can have detrimental effects on human health and the environment. For instance, some fertilisers contain chemicals that can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to respiratory problems and other health issues. Moreover, the intensive farming practices that rely on heavy machinery can lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Local communities may also be negatively impacted, as the increased use of machinery can lead to job losses and the displacement of small-scale farmers.In my opinion, while the use of improved fertilisers and better machinery can make food production cheaper, it is not worth the potential risks to human health and the environment. Instead, I believe that sustainable and organic farming practices should be prioritized, even if they are more expensive. These methods may require more labor and resources, but they ensure that food is produced in a way that is safe for consumption and respectful of the environment. Furthermore, supporting local and small-scale farmers can help maintain the social and economic fabric of rural communities. Ultimately, the true cost of food production should take into account not only the monetary cost but also the environmental and social costs.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The notion that government should allocate its funds to more pressing areas rather than supporting artists has sparked a contentious debate. While some argue that the financial resources of a nation should be directed towards essential public services and infrastructure, I firmly disagree with this perspective.First and foremost, art plays a pivotal role in the cultural and historical identity of a nation. Artists, through their work, contribute to the preservation and promotion of a country's heritage, thereby enriching its societal fabric. By supporting artists, the government essentially invests in the nation's cultural capital, which has long-term benefits that transcend monetary value. It fosters a sense of community and national pride, elements that are crucial for the well-being and unity of a society.Moreover, the arts sector is a significant contributor to the economy. It generates employment opportunities not just for artists but also for a myriad of professionals involved in the production, exhibition, and sale of art. Additionally, a thriving arts scene can boost tourism, attracting visitors who are interested in experiencing the unique cultural offerings of a country. This, in turn, can lead to substantial revenue for local businesses and the government through tourism-related activities.It is also worth considering that the amount of money spent on supporting artists is typically a fraction of the government's overall budget. When compared to the allocations for defense, healthcare, and education, the arts usually receive a minimal portion. Therefore, the argument that funding the arts diverts money away from more critical areas does not hold substantial ground, as the impact of arts funding on the overall budget is relatively minor.In conclusion, while it is understandable that people might prioritize other public expenditures over arts funding, I believe that supporting artists is a vital investment in a nation's cultural, economic, and social development. It is not a question of either/or, but rather about achieving a balanced allocation of resources that recognizes the value of art in enriching and defining a society.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The development of technology has undoubtedly led to numerous environmental problems, including pollution, climate change, and depletion of natural resources. In response to these issues, two distinct perspectives have emerged. On one hand, some people argue that embracing a simpler way of life is the key to mitigating these environmental problems. They suggest that by adopting more modest lifestyles, reducing consumption, and relying less on technology, we can significantly decrease our ecological footprint. This approach emphasizes the need for individuals to make conscious choices about their daily habits and behaviors, such as using public transport, recycling, and conserving energy.On the other hand, others believe that technology itself holds the solution to the environmental problems it has created. Proponents of this view argue that advancements in technology can provide innovative and efficient solutions to environmental challenges. For instance, renewable energy sources, green technologies, and sustainable manufacturing processes can all contribute to reducing the harmful impacts of human activity on the environment. Moreover, technology can facilitate more accurate monitoring and management of environmental resources, enabling more effective conservation and preservation efforts.In my opinion, while a simpler way of life can certainly contribute to reducing environmental problems, the potential of technology to solve these issues should not be underestimated. Technology has the capacity to drive significant positive change, and its continued development can lead to more sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices. However, it is crucial that technological advancements are pursued with environmental considerations in mind, ensuring that solutions are developed with sustainability as a core objective. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the benefits of technology with mindful, environmentally-conscious lifestyle choices is likely to be the most effective strategy for addressing the environmental problems caused by technological development.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The debate about whether professional athletes and entertainers are overpaid has been a longstanding one. In my opinion, professional athletes and entertainers are indeed paid too much money for the work they do. The salaries of top football stars, such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, are staggering, with some earning over $100 million per year. Similarly, the paychecks of A-list actors and singers, such as Dwayne Johnson and Taylor Swift, can reach up to $50 million per movie or album.One argument against these high salaries is that they are disproportionate to the value they bring to society. While entertainers and athletes do bring joy and entertainment to millions of people, their work is not as essential as that of doctors, teachers, or social workers, who are often underpaid and overworked. For example, the average salary of a teacher in the United States is around $60,000 per year, a fraction of what many athletes and entertainers earn in a single performance or game.Furthermore, the high salaries of professional athletes and entertainers can have negative consequences, such as inflating the cost of living and perpetuating income inequality. The money that goes into the pockets of these celebrities could be better spent on more pressing social issues, such as education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation. Additionally, the emphasis on material wealth and fame can create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of excess and narcissism.In conclusion, while professional athletes and entertainers do bring value to society, their salaries are excessive and disproportionate to the value they bring. It is time for us to reevaluate our priorities and consider a more equitable distribution of wealth, one that rewards and values the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their profession.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The debate surrounding the importance of computers and the Internet versus traditional schooling in a child's education has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some individuals argue that computers and the Internet have become indispensable tools for a child's education, as they provide unparalleled access to a vast array of information and educational resources. With the Internet, a child can learn at their own pace, access educational materials from around the world, and engage in interactive learning experiences that can be more effective than traditional teaching methods.On the other hand, there are those who firmly believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. They argue that schools provide a structured learning environment, social interaction, and the guidance of experienced teachers, which are crucial for a child's cognitive, intellectual, and emotional development. Teachers can tailor their teaching methods to meet the individual needs of each student, offer immediate feedback, and help children develop important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.In my opinion, the ideal approach to a child's education is a balance between the use of computers and the Internet, and the traditional school setting. While technology can provide access to a wealth of information and innovative learning tools, the role of teachers and the social aspect of schooling are irreplaceable. Schools offer children the opportunity to interact with peers, develop social skills, and receive the support and guidance necessary for their overall development. Therefore, I believe that computers and the Internet should be seen as complementary tools to enhance the educational experience, rather than a replacement for the traditional school system. By combining the benefits of both, we can provide children with a well-rounded and effective education that prepares them for success in the modern world.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";The debate surrounding capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, has been a contentious issue for centuries. While some argue that it is necessary to control violent crimes, I partially disagree with this notion. In my opinion, the effectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent to violent crimes is debatable.On one hand, capital punishment can serve as a strong deterrent to potential offenders, as the fear of death can be a powerful motivator. Additionally, it can also provide a sense of justice and closure for the families of victims. For instance, in some countries, the death penalty is reserved for the most heinous crimes, such as murder or treason, and its application can help to maintain social order.On the other hand, research has shown that capital punishment does not necessarily lead to a significant reduction in violent crimes. In fact, many countries that have abolished the death penalty have seen a decrease in crime rates. This suggests that other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, education, and law enforcement, play a more significant role in determining crime rates. Moreover, the application of capital punishment can be arbitrary and biased, leading to wrongful convictions and executions.In conclusion, while capital punishment may have some deterrent effect, I do not believe it is necessary to control violent crimes in society. Instead, I think that a more effective approach would be to address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of education, and social inequality. By investing in education, job creation, and social welfare programs, we can create a safer and more just society, where the need for capital punishment is diminished. Ultimately, a more nuanced and multifaceted approach to crime prevention is needed, rather than relying solely on the death penalty.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The notion that businesses should do anything to make a profit is a highly debated topic. While maximizing profits is a primary goal for many companies, I strongly disagree with the statement that they should do anything to achieve this objective.Unscrupulous pursuit of profit can lead to unethical and harmful practices that negatively impact society and the environment. For instance, companies may prioritize cost-cutting measures over employee welfare, resulting in poor working conditions and inadequate compensation. Moreover, companies might engage in environmentally destructive activities, such as pollution and deforestation, in order to reduce costs and boost profits. Such actions not only harm the planet but also damage the company's reputation and long-term sustainability.Furthermore, prioritizing profits above all else can lead to exploitation of consumers. Companies may deceive customers through false advertising, or sell products that are detrimental to their health and well-being. This can erode trust and lead to regulatory backlash, ultimately harming the company's bottom line. In contrast, businesses that prioritize social responsibility and ethical practices often enjoy increased customer loyalty, improved brand reputation, and long-term success.In conclusion, while making a profit is essential for businesses, it should not come at the expense of ethics, social responsibility, and environmental sustainability. Companies should strive to balance their pursuit of profit with responsible and sustainable practices that benefit both the business and society as a whole. By doing so, they can ensure long-term success, maintain a positive reputation, and contribute to the well-being of their customers, employees, and the environment.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The recent announcement of a potential new high school in our neighborhood has sparked a mix of emotions among residents. As a member of this community, I am inclined to support this plan. The construction of a new high school would not only provide a state-of-the-art learning environment for students but also have a positive impact on the local community.First and foremost, a new high school would alleviate the current overcrowding issue in our existing schools. This would enable students to receive a better education, as class sizes would be reduced, and resources would be more readily available. Moreover, the new school would likely feature modern facilities, including advanced technology, science labs, and sports equipment, which would enhance the overall learning experience.Furthermore, the presence of a new high school would also have economic benefits for the neighborhood. The construction process would create new job opportunities, and the school's operations would attract new businesses, such as cafes, bookstores, and other services catering to students and staff. This would inject new life into the local economy and contribute to the area's growth and development.However, I do acknowledge that some residents may have concerns about the potential increase in traffic and noise levels. Nevertheless, I believe that these issues can be mitigated through careful planning and consultation with the community. The school's design and location can be chosen to minimize disruptions, and measures can be taken to ensure that the school's operations do not negatively impact the surrounding area.In conclusion, I firmly support the plan to build a new high school in our neighborhood. The benefits of improved education, economic growth, and community development far outweigh the potential drawbacks. With careful planning and consideration, I am confident that the new school would be a valuable addition to our community, providing a high-quality education for students and enhancing the quality of life for residents.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The statement that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older teenagers has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that adults should have the final say, others believe that teenagers should be given more autonomy. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement.At the age of 15 to 18, teenagers are at a critical stage of development where they are transitioning from childhood to adulthood. They are developing their own thoughts, opinions, and values, and are beginning to take responsibility for their own lives. Making important decisions is an essential part of this process, and by doing so, they learn valuable skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.Moreover, teenagers at this age are often more aware of their own strengths, weaknesses, and interests than their parents. They may have different goals and aspirations that may not align with their parents' expectations. By allowing them to make their own decisions, they can take ownership of their choices and develop a sense of accountability. This, in turn, can lead to increased motivation, self-confidence, and self-esteem.However, it is also important to note that parents and adult relatives can still play a guiding role in the decision-making process. They can provide valuable advice, support, and guidance, while still allowing their teenagers to make the final decision. This approach can help teenagers develop their decision-making skills while also ensuring that they are making informed and responsible choices.In conclusion, I firmly believe that older teenagers should be given the autonomy to make important decisions for themselves. By doing so, they can develop essential life skills, take ownership of their choices, and become more confident and self-assured individuals. While parental guidance is still important, it should be used to support and advise, rather than dictate, the decision-making process.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;The notion that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life is a widely debated topic. While some people agree with this statement, others disagree. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement. Childhood is indeed a carefree and joyful period, where children are oblivious to the complexities and stresses of the adult world. During this stage, they are able to explore, learn, and play without the burden of responsibilities, allowing them to experience pure happiness and innocence.Moreover, childhood is a time of discovery and wonder, where children are constantly learning and experiencing new things. The simplicity and curiosity of childhood enable children to find joy in the smallest of things, such as playing with friends, reading a favorite book, or receiving a small gift. These experiences shape their young minds and create lasting memories that can bring happiness throughout their lives.However, it is also important to acknowledge that not all children have a happy childhood. Some may face difficulties such as poverty, abuse, or neglect, which can greatly impact their well-being and happiness. Additionally, as people grow older, they may experience new sources of happiness, such as forming meaningful relationships, achieving personal goals, or pursuing their passions. Therefore, while childhood may be a happy time, it is not necessarily the happiest time for everyone.In conclusion, while childhood is undoubtedly a special and happy time, it is not the only time of happiness in a person's life. People can experience happiness at various stages of their lives, and it is shaped by individual experiences and circumstances. Nevertheless, the carefree nature and simplicity of childhood make it a unique and happy period that many people look back on fondly.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;People attend college and university for a multitude of reasons, with each individual having their own unique motivations. In my opinion, the primary reason people attend college and university is to acquire advanced knowledge and skills in their chosen field, thereby enhancing their career prospects. For instance, many students pursue higher education to gain specialized knowledge and training that is not readily available through other means. This is particularly true for fields such as medicine, engineering, and law, where a degree is often a prerequisite for entry into the profession.Another significant reason people attend college and university is to increase their earning potential. Numerous studies have shown that individuals with a university degree tend to earn higher salaries than those without one. For example, in the United States, workers with a bachelor's degree typically earn about 60% more than those with only a high school diploma. This financial incentive is a powerful motivator for many students to pursue higher education.In addition to career advancement and financial gain, many people attend college and university to broaden their intellectual and social horizons. Colleges and universities offer a diverse range of courses, seminars, and workshops that allow students to explore new interests, develop critical thinking skills, and engage with people from varied backgrounds. This exposure can foster personal growth, creativity, and independence, making students more confident and well-rounded individuals. Overall, the reasons for attending college and university are multifaceted, encompassing career aspirations, financial ambitions, and personal development. By pursuing higher education, individuals can set themselves up for success, both professionally and personally.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The notion that it is better to have one or two close friends than a large number of casual acquaintances has sparked intense debate among individuals. While some argue that having many acquaintances can provide a sense of belonging and social connection, I firmly believe that having a few close friends is more beneficial.Having close friends provides a deeper sense of emotional connection and support. With a small, of close friends, one can foster meaningful relationships built on trust, empathy, and shared experiences. These relationships are often more satisfying and fulfilling, as they provide a safe space to share thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment. In contrast, a large number of casual acquaintances may provide a superficial sense of social connection, but it often lacks the intimacy and depth that close friendships offer.Moreover, maintaining a large number of casual relationships can be emotionally draining and may lead to feelings of isolation. With many acquaintances, one may feel pressured to constantly interact and maintain a social facade, which can be exhausting. On the other hand, having a few close friends allows for more quality time and attention to be devoted to each relationship, leading to a more balanced and healthy social life.In conclusion, while having a large number of casual acquaintances may provide a sense of social connection, I believe that having one or two close friends is more beneficial. The depth, intimacy, and emotional support that close friendships provide are essential for our emotional and mental well-being. In a world where social media often blurs the lines between genuine relationships and casual acquaintances, it is more important than ever to prioritize and nurture close, meaningful friendships.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";I strongly agree with the statement that life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents were children. There are numerous reasons that support this assertion, and I will highlight a few key examples. Firstly, the advancement in technology has significantly improved the quality of life. With the invention of household appliances, transportation, and communication devices, daily tasks have become more efficient and less labor-intensive. For instance, our grandparents had to manually wash clothes, cook meals, and travel long distances, which consumed a lot of time and energy. In contrast, we can now accomplish these tasks with minimal effort, thanks to machines like washing machines, microwaves, and cars.Another significant factor is the improvement in healthcare. Medical breakthroughs and access to better healthcare facilities have increased life expectancy and reduced mortality rates. Our grandparents were more prone to diseases and had limited access to medical facilities, which made their lives more challenging. Furthermore, the availability of education and information has also made life easier. The internet and other digital platforms have made it possible to access knowledge and learn new skills from the comfort of our own homes. This has opened up opportunities for personal and professional growth, which was not possible in the past.In conclusion, life today is undoubtedly easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents were children. The progress in technology, healthcare, and education has made a significant difference in the quality of life. While there may be new challenges that we face today, the overall standard of living has improved, and we should appreciate the comforts and conveniences that we often take for granted.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;The debate on whether high school should allow students to study the courses they want has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I strongly agree that high schools should permit students to pursue the courses of their choice. This approach has numerous benefits, including increased motivation and engagement, as students are more likely to be interested in subjects they have selected themselves. When students are allowed to choose their courses, they are more inclined to take ownership of their learning, which can lead to better academic outcomes.Furthermore, allowing students to choose their courses can help them discover their passions and strengths, enabling them to make informed decisions about their future careers. By giving students the autonomy to select courses that align with their interests, high schools can foster a more personalized and effective learning experience. This, in turn, can lead to increased student satisfaction and reduced dropout rates, as students are more likely to be invested in their studies.Additionally, permitting students to choose their courses can also promote academic freedom and autonomy. In traditional high school settings, students are often forced to follow a rigid curriculum, which can be restrictive and limiting. By offering students more flexibility in their course selection, high schools can encourage students to think critically and make informed decisions about their academic pursuits. This can help students develop essential life skills, such as decision-making and problem-solving, which are valuable beyond the classroom.In conclusion, allowing high school students to study the courses they want is essential for promoting academic motivation, autonomy, and personalized learning. By giving students the freedom to choose their courses, high schools can create a more engaging and effective learning environment, which can have a positive impact on students' academic and personal development. Therefore, I firmly believe that high schools should allow students to study the courses that they want to study.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The debate about whether to live life at a fast pace or a slow pace has been ongoing for centuries. While some individuals thrive in a hurried environment, I firmly believe that taking one's time and living life at a slower pace is the preferable approach. In my opinion, this mindset allows for a more meaningful and enjoyable experience.First and foremost, living life at a slower pace enables individuals to appreciate the beauty of their surroundings. When rushing from one place to another, it is easy to overlook the intricate details that make life worth living. For instance, taking a stroll through a park on a sunny day can be a therapeutic experience, allowing one to connect with nature and clear their mind. In contrast, hastening through the same park would only serve to deprive one of this opportunity.Another significant advantage of adopting a slower pace is that it promotes productivity and efficiency in the long run. Rushing to complete tasks often leads to careless mistakes and subpar work. On the other hand, taking the time to thoroughly plan and execute a task ensures a higher quality outcome. For example, a chef who rushes to prepare a meal may end up with a dish that is burnt or underseasoned, whereas a chef who takes their time can create a culinary masterpiece.In conclusion, while some individuals may prefer the fast-paced lifestyle, I believe that living life at a slower pace is the key to a more fulfilling and successful existence. By taking the time to appreciate one's surroundings and approach tasks with diligence, individuals can lead a more purposeful and enjoyable life. Ultimately, slowing down allows us to truly experience and savor each moment, making life a more precious and cherished gift.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry has become a significant contributor to economic development, generating billions of dollars in revenue each year. On the one hand, tourism creates jobs, stimulates local economies, and promotes cultural exchange. Many countries rely heavily on tourism to sustain their economies, and it has lifted many communities out of poverty. Furthermore, tourism can also promote the preservation of cultural heritage sites and historical landmarks, as governments and local authorities invest in their maintenance and conservation.On the other hand, the rapid growth of tourism has raised concerns about its impact on the local environment and culture. The influx of tourists can lead to pollution, erosion of natural habitats, and destruction of ecosystems. Additionally, tourism can also lead to the commercialization of cultural practices and traditions, threatening the authenticity and uniqueness of local customs. The sheer number of tourists can also put pressure on local infrastructure, leading to issues such as overcrowding, traffic congestion, and strain on resources.In my opinion, while tourism can be a powerful tool for economic development, it is crucial to implement sustainable tourism practices that prioritize environmental protection and cultural preservation. This can be achieved through responsible tourism planning, regulation, and management. Governments and local authorities must work together to develop strategies that balance economic growth with environmental and cultural conservation. By doing so, we can ensure that tourism continues to support economic development while preserving the unique cultural and natural heritage of tourist destinations for future generations. Ultimately, with careful planning and management, tourism can be a positive force for both economic development and environmental and cultural preservation.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The notion that the government should prioritize funding for public services over the arts has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that allocating more funds to public services is essential, I firmly disagree with the statement. Arts, as a vital component of our culture and identity, cannot be relegated to secondary importance.Firstly, arts play a significant role in fostering creativity,ing innovation, and promoting social cohesion. Music, painting, and other forms of artistic expression have the power to bring people together, transcend borders, and evoke emotions. By investing in the arts, the government can promote cultural diversity, support local talent, and create a vibrant community that benefits everyone.Moreover, the arts sector is a significant contributor to the economy. According to various studies, the arts industry generates substantial revenue, supports numerous jobs, and stimulates local businesses. For instance, music festivals and concerts can attract tourists, create employment opportunities, and boost local economies. Therefore, allocating funds to the arts can have a positive ripple effect on the overall economy.It is also important to note that public services and the arts are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can complement each other. For example, public art installations can enhance public spaces, making them more enjoyable and accessible to everyone. Furthermore, arts programs in schools and community centers can provide valuable skills, promote education, and support social welfare.In conclusion, while public services are essential, the government should not view the arts as a frivolous expenditure. Instead, they should recognize the significant value that arts bring to our society, economy, and culture. A balanced approach that allocates funds to both public services and the arts is the most sensible and beneficial approach. By doing so, the government can promote a holistic and inclusive development that enriches the lives of its citizens.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The traditional notion of having a single, lifelong career is rapidly becoming outdated. In today's fast-paced, dynamic world, the concept of holding multiple careers or pursuing diverse ways of earning a living is gaining momentum. This shift is driven by the need for individuals to stay adaptable, acquire new skills, and remain relevant in an ever-changing job market. As a result, the idea of continuous learning and further education throughout life is becoming the new norm.With technological advancements and automation transforming industries, many jobs are becoming obsolete, while new ones are emerging. To remain employable, individuals must be willing to re-skill and up-skill, often pursuing multiple careers or income streams. This may involve freelancing, entrepreneurship, or part-time work, in addition to a primary career. For instance, a software engineer may also work as a part-time consultant or online tutor, while a marketing professional may start a side business in e-commerce.Furthermore, the rise of the gig economy and remote work has created opportunities for people to explore diverse income sources and work arrangements. This flexibility allows individuals to pursue their passions, interests, and values, rather than being tied to a single career path. Continuous learning and education are essential to navigate this new landscape, as workers must stay updated with the latest trends, technologies, and skills in demand.In conclusion, the notion of having a single career is indeed becoming old-fashioned. The future of work will involve multiple income streams, lifelong learning, and continuous skill acquisition. As the job market continues to evolve, individuals who are adaptable, curious, and committed to ongoing education will be best positioned to thrive in this new era of work. By embracing this shift, we can unlock new opportunities, foster innovation, and create a more resilient and dynamic workforce.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The advent of computers has revolutionized the way we live and work, sparking a heated debate about their impact on society. On one hand, some people argue that computers are more of a hindrance than a help. They claim that the over-reliance on technology has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, as people increasingly prefer to interact with screens rather than humans. Additionally, the constant stream of notifications and distractions from social media and email can decrease productivity and lead to mental health issues. Moreover, the rapid obsolescence of computers and the constant need for upgrades can result in a significant financial burden.On the other hand, others believe that computers are indispensable tools that have transformed the way we work and live. They enable us to access vast amounts of information, connect with people globally, and automate tasks, making our lives more efficient and convenient. Computers have also opened up new avenues for entertainment, education, and creativity, allowing people to express themselves and learn new skills. Furthermore, computers have enabled businesses to operate more efficiently, facilitating global trade and commerce.In my opinion, computers are indeed indispensable tools that have greatly benefited society. While it is true that over-reliance on technology can have negative consequences, the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. With responsible use, computers can enhance our lives, increase productivity, and provide endless opportunities for growth and development. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to use computers in a way that complements their lives, rather than controlling them. By striking a balance between technology use and human interaction, we can harness the full potential of computers to improve our lives and society as a whole.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The debate surrounding the importance of social skills versus qualifications in the workplace has gained significant attention in recent years. On one hand, some employers are placing increased emphasis on social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, as they believe these skills are essential for effective collaboration and productivity in the modern workplace. This view is supported by the fact that many jobs require employees to work in teams, interact with clients, and adapt to new situations, all of which require strong social skills.On the other hand, others argue that qualifications are still the most important factor in hiring decisions. They believe that a candidate's academic background and relevant certifications are the best indicators of their ability to perform a job. This perspective is based on the idea that qualifications demonstrate a person's expertise and knowledge in a specific field, and are therefore a reliable measure of their potential to succeed in a particular role.In my opinion, while qualifications are undoubtedly important, I believe that social skills are equally, if not more, valuable in the workplace. In today's fast-paced and dynamic business environment, employees need to be able to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and think creatively to drive innovation and success. Moreover, social skills can be developed and improved over time, whereas qualifications are often fixed. Therefore, I think that employers should strike a balance between considering a candidate's qualifications and assessing their social skills, such as through interviews, group exercises, or references. By doing so, they can hire employees who not only have the necessary knowledge and expertise but also the ability to work effectively with others and drive business success.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The debate surrounding charity aid has sparked a contentious discussion about whether charities should prioritize those in need globally or focus on their own domestic populations. On one hand, the argument that charities should provide aid to those who need it most, regardless of their geographical location, is compelling. This perspective is rooted in the idea that humanitarian crises, such as natural disasters, famines, and conflicts, require immediate attention and assistance. By providing aid to those most in need worldwide, charities can help alleviate immense suffering and save countless lives. For instance, international charities have played a pivotal role in responding to global emergencies like the refugee crisis or pandemic outbreaks, underscoring the importance of a global approach to charity work.On the other hand, some argue that charity organizations should concentrate on helping people within their own countries. This view is based on the premise that there are always those in need domestically who could benefit from charity aid. By focusing on local issues, charities can address problems that are often overlooked or underfunded, such as homelessness, hunger, and access to education or healthcare. Moreover, donating locally can also foster a sense of community and encourage volunteerism among the population, thereby strengthening social bonds and promoting a culture of giving.In my opinion, a balanced approach is the most effective. Charities should indeed prioritize those in the most dire need globally, especially in situations of acute crisis. However, they should also maintain a commitment to addressing domestic issues. This dual focus allows charities to be responsive to emergencies worldwide while also nurturing and improving their own communities. Ultimately, the goal of charity is to alleviate suffering and improve lives, a mission that transcends borders but also requires attention to local needs. By adopting a strategy that encompasses both global outreach and local engagement, charities can maximize their impact and contribute to a more equitable and compassionate world.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The notion that students learn more from lessons with teachers than from other sources has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that traditional teaching methods are the most effective, I partially disagree with this statement. In my opinion, students can learn a significant amount from both teachers and other sources, and the most effective learning approach often involves a combination of the two.On the one hand, teachers play a vital role in providing guidance, support, and feedback to students. They can tailor their lessons to meet the needs of their students, create a interactive and engaging learning environment, and help students to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, teachers can also provide students with valuable feedback on their progress, which is essential for improving their understanding and performance.On the other hand, other sources such as the internet and television can also be valuable learning tools. The internet, for example, provides access to a vast array of educational resources, including online courses, educational videos, and interactive learning materials. Students can use these resources to learn at their own pace, review material they did not understand in class, and explore topics in greater depth. Additionally, documentaries and educational programs on television can provide students with a visual and engaging way to learn about different subjects.In conclusion, while teachers are essential for providing guidance and support, other sources such as the internet and television can also be valuable learning tools. I believe that students can learn effectively from a combination of both traditional teaching methods and other sources, and that the most effective learning approach often involves a blend of the two. By utilizing both teachers and other sources, students can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and develop a range of skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are crucial in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. While some argue that these events bring nations together and provide a platform for friendly competition, I partially agree with this opinion.On one hand, these international sporting events do offer a unique opportunity for countries to put aside their differences and engage in a shared experience. The football World Cup, for instance, attracts a massive global audience and fosters a sense of unity among fans from diverse backgrounds. The excitement and passion generated by these events can indeed help to ease international tensions, as people from different nations come together to celebrate their shared love of sports. Moreover, these events provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, as fans can express their national pride in a controlled and respectful environment.On the other hand, these events can also be a source of conflict and intensified nationalism. The intense rivalry and competition inherent in these events can sometimes lead to clashes between fans and exacerbate existing tensions between nations. For example, the political and social tensions between countries can be reflected in the behavior of their fans, which might lead to violence and disorder. Furthermore, the massive investment and attention devoted to these events can divert attention and resources away from more pressing global issues, such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the football World Cup can play a role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, their impact should not be overstated. These events are not a panacea for global conflicts, and their effects can be complex and multifaceted. Nevertheless, when approached in a spirit of mutual respect and friendship, they can contribute to a more harmonious and peaceful world.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The rise of distance-learning programmes has revolutionized the way people access education, allowing them to study from the comfort of their own homes. However, some individuals argue that these programmes cannot provide the same benefits as attending a traditional college or university. I disagree with this statement, and believe that distance-learning programmes can be just as effective as traditional education.One of the primary advantages of distance-learning programmes is flexibility. Students can create their own schedules, allowing them to balance work, family, and other responsibilities with their studies. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those who cannot attend traditional institutions due to geographical or financial constraints. Furthermore, distance-learning programmes often provide access to a wide range of courses and materials, which can be easily updated and modified to reflect the latest developments in a particular field.Moreover, many distance-learning programmes now incorporate interactive elements, such as online discussions, video conferencing, and virtual labs, which can provide students with a similar sense of community and engagement as traditional classroom settings. Additionally, the lack of distractions and peer pressure in a home environment can actually help some students to focus and learn more effectively.While it is true that distance-learning programmes may lack the socialization and hands-on experiences of traditional education, I believe that these drawbacks can be mitigated with careful programme design and student motivation. With the right mindset and support, students can achieve the same level of knowledge and skills as their traditionally educated counterparts. In conclusion, I firmly believe that distance-learning programmes can bring numerous benefits and can be a viable alternative to traditional education.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The extinction of numerous species has become a pressing concern in today's world. While some argue that we should prioritize the protection of endangered animals, others believe that human problems should take precedence. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my personal viewpoint.On the one hand, the protection of extinct species is crucial for maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystem. Animals play a vital role in preserving the natural environment, and their extinction can have severe consequences, such as disrupting food chains and causing loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, many species possess unique characteristics that can provide valuable insights into medical research, leading to potential cures for human diseases. Therefore, it is essential that we take measures to conserve and protect these species from dying out.On the other hand, some people argue that human problems should be our primary concern. They believe that issues such as poverty, hunger, and disease should take priority over animal conservation. This perspective is understandable, given the immense suffering that humans endure globally. However, I disagree with this view, as I believe that human well-being is intricately linked to the health of our planet. By protecting animals and their habitats, we are ultimately ensuring the long-term survival of our own species.In conclusion, while both opinions have valid points, I firmly believe that protecting extinct species is essential for the well-being of our planet and, by extension, human beings. It is our responsibility to preserve the natural world, and I think that conservation efforts should be a top priority. By working together to protect endangered species, we can ensure a sustainable future for all living creatures, including humans.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The notion that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked intense debate. While the idea of promoting gender equality is commendable, I only partially agree with this proposition.On the one hand, ensuring equal representation of both genders in every subject can help bridge the existing gap in certain fields where one gender is underrepresented. For instance, traditionally male-dominated fields like engineering and computer science have seen a significant increase in female enrollment in recent years, thanks to targeted recruitment efforts. This not only promotes diversity but also brings unique perspectives to the table, leading to a more comprehensive learning experience.On the other hand, enforcing a strict equal gender ratio in every subject could lead to unintended consequences. It may result in less qualified candidates being accepted over more qualified ones simply to meet the gender quota, which could compromise the academic integrity of the institution. Furthermore, certain subjects may inherently attract more students of one gender due to personal interests or career goals, and imposing an equal gender ratio could limit the opportunities of students who are genuinely passionate about a particular field.In conclusion, while the idea of achieving equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is well-intentioned, a more nuanced approach is necessary. Universities should focus on creating an inclusive environment that encourages students of all genders to pursue their interests without imposing rigid quotas. By doing so, we can promote genuine diversity and equality, allowing students to thrive in their chosen subjects without compromising academic standards. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide equal opportunities, not equal numbers.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";I strongly agree with the statement that face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication. Face-to-face interaction provides a more personal and engaging experience, allowing for a deeper understanding and connection with the other person. When communicating in person, the nonverbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice convey emotions and attitudes more effectively than written or verbal communication alone.Moreover, face-to-face communication promotes more effective and efficient exchange of ideas. It enables immediate feedback, questions, and clarifications, which helps to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications. For instance, in business meetings, face-to-face interaction facilitates negotiation, builds trust, and establishes stronger relationships with clients and colleagues. Additionally, face-to-face communication is essential in building and maintaining personal relationships, as it allows people to express emotions and empathy more naturally.In contrast, other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls, often lack the personal touch and can lead to misinterpretation. Emails and letters can be misread or misunderstood, while telephone calls can lack the visual cues that are essential for effective communication. Although technology has made communication faster and more convenient, it cannot replace the value of face-to-face interaction. In conclusion, face-to-face communication is superior to other types of communication, as it provides a more engaging, effective, and personal experience, essential for building strong relationships and exchanging ideas.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The significant advancements in medical care have led to a substantial increase in human lifespan, resulting in a considerable rise in life expectancy. While this development has numerous benefits, such as allowing individuals to spend more time with loved ones and contribute to society, it also has several drawbacks. In my opinion, the disadvantages of this trend do not outweigh the advantages.On the one hand, the increased life expectancy puts a strain on pension and social security systems, as governments are required to provide financial support for a longer period. Additionally, the growing elderly population can lead to a greater burden on healthcare systems, as older individuals often require more medical attention. Furthermore, an aging population can result in a shortage of skilled workers, as older employees retire and are not replaced by younger, equally skilled workers.On the other hand, the benefits of increased life expectancy far outweigh the drawbacks. People are now able to pursue their passions and interests for a longer period, leading to a more fulfilling life. Moreover, the increased life expectancy allows for the transfer of knowledge and experience from one generation to the next, as older individuals can share their wisdom and insights with younger people. This, in turn, can lead to significant societal advancements and innovations.In conclusion, while the increased life expectancy resulting from improved medical care has its drawbacks, I firmly believe that the advantages of this development far outweigh the disadvantages. The benefits of a longer, healthier life, including the opportunity to pursue one's passions and share knowledge with future generations, make this trend a highly positive one. As medical care continues to advance, it is likely that human lifespan will continue to increase, leading to a more productive, innovative, and fulfilling society.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";I agree that successful people often do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. This mindset is essential for achieving success, as it allows individuals to step out of their comfort zones, challenge themselves, and pursue new opportunities. By taking risks and trying new things, people can discover new strengths, develop innovative ideas, and stay ahead of the curve in their respective fields.Playing it safe and only doing what one knows how to do well can lead to stagnation and complacency. It is the willingness to take calculated risks and experiment with new approaches that enables individuals to grow, learn, and adapt to changing circumstances. Many successful entrepreneurs, inventors, and leaders have achieved their goals by embracing uncertainty and pushing beyond the boundaries of what is familiar to them.Furthermore, doing something new or taking risks can also foster creativity, resilience, and problem-solving skills. When individuals are forced to navigate unfamiliar terrain, they must think critically, be resourceful, and find novel solutions to unexpected challenges. These skills, in turn, can be applied to various aspects of their lives, leading to greater overall success.In conclusion, successful people often prioritize taking risks and trying new things over playing it safe. This approach enables them to stay innovative, adaptable, and open to new experiences, ultimately leading to greater personal and professional growth. By embracing uncertainty and challenging themselves, individuals can unlock their full potential, achieve their goals, and make a lasting impact in their chosen fields. Therefore, I firmly believe that taking risks and doing something new is a crucial component of achieving success.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The question of whether higher education should be accessible to all students or only to good students has sparked a debate among educators and policymakers. On one hand, some people argue that higher education should be reserved for good students who have demonstrated academic excellence and a strong work ethic. They believe that this approach will ensure that only the most capable and motivated students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their chosen fields.On the other hand, others believe that higher education should be available to all students, regardless of their academic background or abilities. They argue that education is a fundamental right and that everyone deserves the opportunity to pursue higher learning. This approach will not only promote social mobility and equality but also provide a skilled and educated workforce that can contribute to the economic growth and development of a country.I agree with the view that higher education should be available to all students. Education is a key driver of personal and societal progress, and denying students the opportunity to pursue higher learning can have long-term consequences for individuals and society as a whole. Moreover, providing access to higher education can help to identify and nurture talented students who may not have had the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities earlier in their academic careers. By making higher education accessible to all, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the chance to reach their full potential.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate about whether universities should prioritize improving facilities or hiring famous teachers has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I agree that universities spend money more effectively on improving facilities rather than hiring famous teachers.First and foremost, improving facilities, such as laboratories and libraries, provides students with hands-on experience and access to cutting-edge technology. This enables them to gain practical skills and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field. Well-equipped facilities also attract more students and enhance their overall learning experience. Moreover, state-of-the-art facilities can be used by multiple generations of students, making them a long-term investment in the university's infrastructure.On the other hand, hiring famous teachers, although beneficial in terms of prestige and attracting students, may not necessarily translate to better learning outcomes. Famous teachers may not always be effective educators, and their high salaries could divert funds away from other essential areas of university expenditure. Furthermore, universities often have a high faculty turnover rate, meaning that the benefits of hiring a famous teacher may be short-lived.In conclusion, while hiring famous teachers can bring prestige and attract students, I firmly believe that universities spend money more effectively on improving facilities. By investing in modern laboratories, libraries, and other infrastructure, universities can provide students with a superior learning environment and equip them with the skills required to succeed in their chosen field. This approach not only benefits current students but also future generations, making it a more sustainable and responsible use of university funds.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;I strongly agree with the statement that high schools should allow students to study the courses that they want to study. This approach has several benefits, both academically and personally, for the students. Firstly, it allows students to pursue their interests and passions, which can lead to increased motivation and engagement in their studies. When students are studying subjects they are genuinely interested in, they are more likely to be motivated to learn and achieve higher grades.For instance, a student who is passionate about art may feel constrained by a curriculum that emphasizes only core subjects like mathematics and science. By allowing students to choose courses that align with their interests, schools can foster a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom. This autonomy can also help students discover their strengths and talents, potentially guiding them towards career paths that they may not have considered otherwise.Moreover, allowing students to choose their courses can prepare them better for the real world. In their future careers, individuals are often expected to be self-directed and make choices about their professional development. By giving students the freedom to choose their courses, they are essentially teaching them how to make informed decisions about their educational pathway, a skill that is invaluable in both academic and professional contexts.In conclusion, providing students with the freedom to choose their courses can lead to a more engaging, effective, and personalized learning experience. It prepares them for independence, fosters their interests, and can lead to greater academic success and personal fulfillment. Therefore, high schools should indeed allow students to study the courses they want, as it empowers them to take control of their learning and development.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;I strongly agree with the statement that games are as important for adults as they are for children. While it is widely acknowledged that games play a crucial role in the cognitive and social development of children, their benefits extend far beyond childhood. In fact, games can have a profound impact on the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of adults.One of the primary reasons games are important for adults is that they provide a much-needed escape from the stresses of everyday life. Adults lead busy and often high-pressure lives, and games offer a healthy way to unwind and relax. For example, games like puzzle games, strategy games, and sports games can help adults improve their cognitive skills, such as problem-solving and decision-making, while also reducing stress and anxiety. Moreover, multiplayer games provide adults with opportunities to socialize and connect with others, which is essential for maintaining mental health and combating loneliness.Furthermore, games can also have physical benefits for adults. For instance, video games that require physical activity, such as dancing or exercise games, can help adults stay physically active and improve their overall health. Additionally, games can also be used as a tool for learning new skills and acquiring knowledge. For example, language learning games, cooking games, and business simulation games can help adults develop new skills and enhance their career prospects.In conclusion, games are indeed as important for adults as they are for children. They offer a wide range of benefits, from reducing stress and improving cognitive skills to providing opportunities for socialization and physical activity. As such, adults should make time for games in their lives, and not view them as solely the domain of children. By doing so, they can reap the many rewards that games have to offer and improve their overall quality of life.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";I agree that modern technology is creating a single world culture. The rapid advancement and globalization of technology have led to the dissemination of ideas, values, and beliefs across the globe, creating a sense of unity and shared culture among people from different backgrounds. One significant reason is the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These platforms have made it possible for people to connect with one another, regardless of geographical location, fostering a sense of global community. For instance, trends and challenges that originate in one part of the world can quickly spread to other parts, creating a shared experience among people worldwide. Another reason is the global accessibility of entertainment content, such as movies, music, and TV shows, through streaming services like Netflix and YouTube. This has led to a shared cultural experience, where people from different countries can enjoy and discuss the same content, bridging cultural gaps and fostering a sense of global citizenship.Furthermore, the internet has made it possible for people to access information and educational resources from anywhere in the world, promoting a standardized knowledge base and values. This,'t only contributes to a single world culture but also promotes global understanding and cooperation.However, it is essential to acknowledge that while modern technology is creating a single world culture, it is not erasing local cultures and traditions. Instead, it is promoting a fusion of cultures, where local customs and values are preserved and shared globally, enriching the diversity of the global culture.In conclusion, modern technology is indeed creating a single world culture by fostering global connections, shared experiences, and access to information. While it is crucial to preserve local cultures, the emergence of a global culture is an inevitable and potentially enriching consequence of technological advancements.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The notion that achieving success is easier with family support nowadays than it was in the past is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, I agree with this statement. Family support has always been a crucial factor in achieving success, but its significance has increased in modern times.In the past, families were often more self-sufficient and relied less on external resources. However, with the advent of modern technology and the increasing complexity of the world, the role of family support has evolved. Today, having a supportive family can provide an individual with access to valuable networks, financial backing, and emotional guidance. For instance, a family member with connections in a particular industry can introduce a young entrepreneur to potential investors or mentors, significantly enhancing their chances of success.Moreover, the emotional support provided by family members can be a powerful motivator. Knowing that one has a safety net and a constant source of encouragement can give an individual the confidence to take risks and pursue their goals with greater determination. This is particularly evident in the stories of many successful individuals who attribute their achievements to the unwavering support of their families.In contrast, those without strong family support often face more hurdles on their path to success. They may have to navigate challenges alone, without the benefit of guidance, financial assistance, or emotional support. While it is certainly possible to achieve success without family support, the journey is undoubtedly more arduous.In conclusion, the role of family support in achieving success has become more pronounced in contemporary times. With the complexities and challenges of the modern world, having a supportive family can be a significant advantage, providing resources, connections, and motivation that can make all the difference between success and failure. Therefore, I firmly believe that nowadays, it is indeed much easier to achieve success with the help of one's family than it was before.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"I strongly agree with the statement that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies. One of the primary reasons for this is that reading allows the reader to use their imagination to create the setting, characters, and plot, which makes the experience more personal and engaging. When watching a movie, the visuals and characters are already predefined, and the viewer has limited scope to exercise their imagination. For instance, reading J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" series, allows readers to envision Middle Earth and its inhabitants in their own unique way, which can be more captivating than a movie adaptation.Another reason why reading fiction is more enjoyable is that it provides a deeper understanding of the characters' thoughts, feelings, and motivations. Novels and short stories often include detailed descriptions of characters' inner lives, allowing readers to develop a stronger emotional connection with them. In contrast, movies are limited by time and can only show the characters' actions and dialogue, leaving some aspects of their personalities unexplored. For example, Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" offers a nuanced exploration of Elizabeth Bennet's inner world, which may not be fully captured in a film adaptation.Furthermore, reading fiction can be a more immersive experience than watching movies because it requires active participation from the reader. As readers, we need to interpret the text, make connections between events, and infer the author's intentions, which makes the experience more engaging and interactive. In conclusion, while watching movies can be entertaining, reading fiction provides a richer, more immersive, and more enjoyable experience due to its ability to stimulate imagination, provide deeper character insight, and require active reader participation."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The phenomenon of language death has sparked a debate about its implications on global harmony and understanding. On one hand, some people argue that a reduction in the number of languages can promote unity and facilitate communication among people from diverse backgrounds. With fewer languages, the likelihood of miscommunication and misunderstandings decreases, and people can more easily interact and cooperate with one another. This, in turn, can foster global harmony and understanding.On the other hand, others contend that language death is a loss of cultural diversity and identity. Languages are intricately linked to the history, customs, and traditions of a community, and their extinction can lead to the erosion of cultural heritage. Moreover, linguistic diversity is a valuable resource that enables people to express themselves uniquely and maintain their distinctiveness. The preservation of languages is essential to safeguarding the richness of human expression and experience.In my opinion, the loss of languages is a negative trend that undermines cultural diversity and identity. While a fewer number of languages may facilitate communication, it also leads to cultural homogenization and the suppression of minority voices. The preservation of languages is crucial to maintaining the complexity and richness of human culture, and efforts should be made to support and promote linguistic diversity. Furthermore, with the aid of technology and language education, people can learn and communicate in multiple languages, thereby promoting global understanding without sacrificing cultural identity. Ultimately, a world with diverse languages is a world that values and celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences of its inhabitants.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The notion that the past was simpler and better is a common sentiment among elderly individuals. While it is understandable to nostalgic for bygone eras, I partially disagree with this statement. On one hand, it is true that life in the past may have been less complex and faster-paced. Without the burden of modern technology, people had more face-to-face interactions and a stronger sense of community. For instance, my grandmother often recounts stories of her childhood, where neighbors would gather for weekly dinners and children would play outside until sunset. This sense of simplicity and togetherness is indeed something that is often lacking in today's society.On the other hand, I believe that the past had its own set of unique challenges and difficulties. Medical care, for example, was relatively primitive compared to today's standards. My grandfather, who suffered from a chronic illness, often speaks about the limited treatment options and lengthy recovery times he experienced. In contrast, modern medicine has made tremendous strides, allowing people to live longer and healthier lives. Furthermore, the past was also marked by social and economic inequalities, such as limited access to education and job opportunities.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that the past may have had a certain simplicity and charm to it, I do not entirely agree that it was better than today. The past and present have their own strengths and weaknesses, and it is unfair to make a blanket statement about which era is superior. By learning from the past and embracing the advancements of the present, we can work towards creating a better future for all. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to appreciate the unique aspects of their own time and make the most of the opportunities available to them.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The notion that secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money has garnered significant attention in recent years. I wholeheartedly agree with this argument, as managing finances is an essential life skill that benefits individuals throughout their lives. In today's world, where financial literacy is crucial for making informed decisions, it is imperative that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate the complex world of personal finance. By incorporating money management into school curricula, students can develop a deeper understanding of budgeting, saving, and investing. This, in turn, can help them make smart financial decisions, avoid debt, and build a secure financial future.Moreover, teaching money management in schools can have a profound impact on students' future financial stability. It can help them develop healthy financial habits, such as saving and budgeting, which can benefit them in the long run. Furthermore, it can also help them avoid common financial pitfalls, such as accumulating credit card debt or falling prey to fraudulent schemes.In addition, teaching money management in schools can also promote financial independence and responsibility among students. By learning how to manage their finances effectively, students can become more self-sufficient and less reliant on others for financial support. This, in turn, can foster a sense of confidence and empowerment, as students are better equipped to take control of their financial lives.In conclusion, teaching money management in secondary school and higher school is a vital life skill that can benefit students in numerous ways. It can promote financial literacy, stability, and independence, ultimately empowering students to make informed decisions about their financial lives. As such, I strongly agree that money management should be taught in schools, as it is an essential skill that can have a lasting impact on students' future financial well-being.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;When it comes to living arrangements, some single individuals prefer to live with a roommate, while others opt for solitude. Personally, I would prefer to live alone. The primary reason for this preference is the value I place on privacy and personal space. Living alone allows me to have complete control over my environment, enabling me to organize my space as I see fit and maintain it to my standards of cleanliness and order.Another significant advantage of living alone is the flexibility it offers. Without having to consider a roommate's schedule or preferences, I can come and go as I please, host guests whenever I want, and engage in hobbies or watch movies at any time without disturbing anyone. This independence is particularly beneficial for individuals with non-traditional work schedules or those who enjoy late-night activities.Moreover, living alone fosters a sense of responsibility and self-sufficiency. Managing a household on my own would teach me important life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and time management. It would also allow me to establish a daily routine that suits my needs and lifestyle, promoting a healthier and more balanced life.While living with a roommate can offer companionship and shared expenses, for me, the benefits of living alone outweigh these advantages. Living alone provides an environment where I can focus on personal growth, enjoy my privacy, and live life on my own terms. It's an opportunity to discover myself, my strengths, and my weaknesses in a setting that is completely my own. In conclusion, the independence, privacy, and personal growth opportunities make living alone the preferable choice for me.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and that state laws prohibiting it should be upheld. Allowing smoking in restaurants poses significant health risks to both the patrons and the staff. Secondhand smoke, also known as passive smoke, has been proven to cause a range of serious health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory infections.Moreover, smoking in restaurants can be a nuisance to non-smokers, who may find the smell and smoke unpleasant and disruptive to their dining experience. In a public place like a restaurant, it is reasonable to expect a smoke-free environment where people can enjoy their meals without being exposed to harmful smoke. Upholding state laws that prohibit smoking in restaurants is essential to protecting public health and ensuring that restaurants remain a comfortable and enjoyable space for everyone.Additionally, allowing smoking in restaurants can also have economic implications. Many customers may choose to avoid restaurants that permit smoking, which can lead to a loss of business and revenue. In contrast, restaurants that are smoke-free can attract a wider range of customers, including families and health-conscious individuals, who prefer a smoke-free environment. Overall, prohibiting smoking in restaurants is a necessary measure to protect public health, ensure a pleasant dining experience, and support the economic viability of restaurants. Therefore, I firmly believe that state laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants should be upheld and enforced to create a healthier and more considerate environment for everyone.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The statement that growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way is a topic of debate among scholars and the general public. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement. The increasing depiction of violence in films has had a profound impact on the behavior and attitudes of youngsters.Exposure to violent films can desensitize youngsters to the consequences of violence, making it seem more acceptable and even glorified. This can lead to a decrease in empathy and an increase in aggressive behavior. Moreover, the repeated viewing of violent scenes can shape youngsters' perceptions of the world, making them more likely to expect and engage in violent behavior. Additionally, the influence of violent films can be particularly damaging for youngsters who are already vulnerable or at risk, such as those from troubled homes or with a history of behavioral problems.Furthermore, research has shown that youngsters who are exposed to violent films are more likely to engage in delinquent behavior, such as fighting, vandalism, and other forms of antisocial behavior. This is because violent films can provide a blueprint for violent behavior, making it seem like a viable solution to problems. Moreover, the glamourization of violence in films can also lead to a fascination with weapons and a desire to imitate the violent behavior depicted on screen.In conclusion, the growing violence in films has indeed had a negative impact on youngsters. The depiction of violence can shape their attitudes and behaviors, leading to a decrease in empathy and an increase in aggressive behavior. It is essential for parents, guardians, and filmmakers to be mindful of the content they create and consume, and to take steps to mitigate the potential harm caused by violent films. By doing so, we can help to promote a more positive and peaceful influence on the next generation.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";The importance of being well-informed in today's fast-paced world cannot be overstated. With the plethora of news sources available, it has become essential to diversify one's information intake to gain a comprehensive understanding of current events. I firmly agree that in order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.Relying on a single news source can lead to a biased and narrow perspective, as each outlet may have its own agenda and interpretation of events. By consuming news from multiple sources, including those with differing viewpoints and editorial stances, individuals can develop a more nuanced and balanced understanding of the issues. This diversity of information enables readers to identify patterns, inconsistencies, and areas of agreement, ultimately allowing them to form their own informed opinions.Furthermore, different news sources often specialize in specific areas or regions, as some may have more in-depth coverage of local or international news. For instance, a person interested in global affairs may find that a combination of BBC, Al Jazeera, and CNN provides a more comprehensive understanding of worldwide events than relying on a single source. Similarly, those interested in local news may need to consult a variety of regional newspapers and online outlets to stay informed about community issues.In conclusion, accessing a wide range of news sources is crucial for individuals seeking to be well-informed. By doing so, they can avoid the pitfalls of biased reporting, gain a more comprehensive understanding of current events, and develop informed opinions. In an era where misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly, it is more important than ever to consult multiple news sources to ensure a well-rounded and accurate grasp of the world around us.
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The debate over whether to preserve old buildings or demolish them to make way for new development has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people argue that old buildings are a hindrance to progress and that the land they occupy is too valuable to be wasted on outdated structures. They believe that these buildings can be replaced with newer, more efficient ones that can generate more revenue and provide better amenities. This perspective is particularly prevalent in cities where space is scarce and demand for housing and commercial properties is high.On the other hand, there are those who believe that old buildings are an integral part of our cultural heritage and should be preserved at all costs. They argue that these buildings provide a link to our past,serving as a reminder of our history and the events that shaped our society. Moreover, old buildings often possess a unique architectural style and character that is lost in modern constructions. Preserving them helps to maintain the aesthetic appeal and charm of our cities, making them more attractive to tourists and residents alike.In my opinion, the preservation of old buildings is essential. While it is true that land is valuable, the cultural and historical significance of these buildings far outweighs their monetary value. By preserving them, we not only honor our past but also provide future generations with a tangible connection to their heritage. Furthermore, with careful restoration and repurposing, old buildings can be adapted to meet the needs of modern society, making them a valuable and sustainable resource. Therefore, I firmly believe that old buildings should be preserved and protected for the benefit of our collective cultural identity.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The widespread use of mobile phones among young people has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today's society. While some argue that mobile phones are an indispensable tool, others claim that they have a detrimental impact on the younger generation. In my opinion, the popularity of mobile phones among young people is a double-edged sword, with both positive and negative consequences.On the one hand, mobile phones have made it easier for young people to stay connected with their friends and family, as well as access a vast amount of information and educational resources. For instance, I use my mobile phone to stay in touch with my friends who live abroad, and to access online study materials that help me with my schoolwork. Moreover, mobile phones have also enabled young people to capture and share their experiences, creativity, and ideas through social media platforms, which can be a powerful tool for self-expression and community building.On the other hand, the over-reliance on mobile phones can lead to social isolation, decreased attention span, and decreased face-to-face communication skills. I have seen many of my friends and classmates spending hours on their mobile phones, scrolling through social media, playing games, or watching videos, rather than engaging in physical activities, reading, or participating in meaningful conversations. This can have negative effects on their mental and physical health, as well as their relationships and academic performance.In conclusion, while mobile phones can be a valuable tool for young people, their popularity can also have negative consequences if not used responsibly. It is essential for young people to strike a balance between their mobile phone use and other aspects of their lives, and for parents, educators, and policymakers to promote healthy mobile phone habits and digital literacy among young people.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The debate surrounding the implementation of fixed punishments versus considering the circumstances of an individual crime has been ongoing for years. Proponents of fixed punishments argue that this approach ensures consistency and fairness in the application of the law. Every individual who commits the same type of crime receives the same punishment, regardless of their motivations or circumstances. This approach is seen as a deterrent, as potential offenders know exactly what to expect if they are caught.On the other hand, opponents of fixed punishments argue that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for the complexities of real-life situations. They believe that the circumstances surrounding a crime and the motivations behind it are crucial in determining an appropriate punishment. For instance, a person who steals food to feed their family is different from someone who steals for personal gain. By considering these factors, the justice system can provide more nuanced and just punishments that reflect the individual's level of culpability.Moreover, taking into account the circumstances of a crime can also lead to more effective rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into society. By understanding the motivations and circumstances that led to the crime, the justice system can provide targeted support and interventions to address the underlying issues, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. In conclusion, while fixed punishments may provide consistency, considering the circumstances of an individual crime is essential for ensuring justice is served and that punishments are fair, effective, and rehabilitative.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;When it comes to leisure activities, I firmly believe that spending time outdoors is the better option. Not only does it provide an opportunity to connect with nature, but it also offers a wide range of physical and mental health benefits. For instance, outdoor activities such as hiking, walking, or simply taking a stroll in a park can help reduce stress and anxiety, while also improving mood and overall well-being.In contrast, spending leisure time indoors can often lead to a sedentary lifestyle, characterized by watching television, playing video games, or scrolling through social media. While these activities can be entertaining, they can also lead to a lack of physical activity, social isolation, and decreased exposure to natural light and fresh air. On the other hand, outdoor activities provide a chance to engage in physical exercise, socialize with others, and enjoy the beauty of nature.Personally, I prefer to spend my free time outdoors because it allows me to recharge and refocus. For example, I enjoy going for a run or a bike ride in the morning, which helps me clear my mind and prepare for the day ahead. Additionally, outdoor activities such as camping, picnicking, or simply spending time in a garden or a backyard can provide a sense of freedom and adventure that is often lacking in indoor activities.In conclusion, while some people may prefer to spend their leisure time indoors, I firmly believe that spending time outdoors is the better option. With its numerous physical and mental health benefits, opportunities for socialization and physical activity, and chances to connect with nature, outdoor leisure activities offer a unique and rewarding experience that can enhance overall quality of life.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has revolutionized the way people travel, offering unprecedented freedom to explore distant destinations. On one hand, the proponents of affordable air travel argue that it democratizes travel, enabling ordinary people to experience diverse cultures and landscapes that were previously inaccessible. This, in turn, has boosted tourism,,ing economic growth and fostering global understanding. Cheap air travel has also bridged geographical gaps, facilitating family reunions, business meetings, and educational exchanges.On the other hand, critics contend that the proliferation of cheap air travel has severe environmental consequences. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution, and habitat destruction. The increased demand for air travel, fueled by low-cost carriers, exacerbates these problems, threatening the very ecosystems that tourists seek to experience. To mitigate these effects, some advocate for higher air travel costs to discourage unnecessary flights and incentivize more sustainable modes of transportation.In my opinion, while the environmental concerns are legitimate, a blanket increase in air travel costs may not be the most effective solution. Instead, a balanced approach could be implemented, where a moderate pricing strategy is combined with investments in sustainable aviation technologies and practices. This could include carbon offsetting, more fuel-efficient aircraft, and optimized flight routes. Moreover, governments and airlines could promote eco-friendly travel options and educate passengers about the environmental impact of their travel choices. By adopting such a multifaceted approach, we can reconcile the benefits of affordable air travel with the need to protect our planet for future generations. Ultimately, responsible and sustainable air travel practices can ensure that the freedom to explore the world is not compromised by the imperative to preserve it.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;The debate about whether to live in a small town or a big city has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the quiet and close-knit community of a small town, I would prefer to live in a big city. There are several reasons that support my preference for city living.Firstly, big cities offer a wide range of job opportunities, which is a major factor to consider when choosing a place to live. Cities are often hubs for industries and businesses, providing a diverse range of career paths to pursue. For example, New York City is a global financial center, and many people move there to work in finance, law, or other related fields. In contrast, small towns may have limited job opportunities, making it difficult for individuals to find employment that matches their skills and interests.Secondly, big cities provide access to a wide range of cultural and entertainment options. From museums and art galleries to restaurants and theaters, cities offer a vibrant and dynamic cultural scene. For instance, London is known for its world-class museums, such as the British Museum, and its West End theater district. In a small town, these types of cultural and entertainment options may be scarce or non-existent.Lastly, big cities are often more diverse and cosmopolitan, providing a unique and exciting living experience. Cities like Tokyo, Paris, and Sydney are melting pots of different cultures, cuisines, and lifestyles, offering a rich and stimulating environment to live in. In conclusion, while small towns have their charms, I believe that the benefits of living in a big city, including job opportunities, cultural options, and diversity, make it the preferred choice for me.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;"Rewarding employees for their good work is essential to motivate them and encourage further excellent performance. While salary increases and promotions are traditional methods of recognition, they are not the only effective ways to reward employees. Other rewards can be just as motivating and beneficial in fostering a positive work environment.One alternative reward is additional time off or flexible work arrangements. For instance, a company can offer extra vacation days or allow employees to work from home one day a week. This type of reward acknowledges the employee's hard work and provides them with a better work-life balance, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and productivity. Google, for example, is famous for its generous leave policy, which allows employees to take time off to pursue their own projects, resulting in innovative ideas and solutions.Another effective reward is opportunities for professional development and growth. This can include training sessions, workshops, or conferences related to the employee's field of interest. By investing in their employees' skills and knowledge, companies demonstrate their commitment to their employees' career advancement and future success. For example, Microsoft offers its employees access to a wide range of online courses and training programs, which has led to a highly skilled and motivated workforce.Finally, public recognition and appreciation can also be a powerful motivator. A simple ""employee of the month"" award or a recognition ceremony can go a long way in boosting employee morale and encouraging others to strive for similar recognition. Companies like Facebook, which has a ""Wall of Fame"" to recognize employees' achievements, demonstrate the impact of public recognition on employee motivation and engagement.In conclusion, rewarding employees for good work is crucial for their motivation and job satisfaction. While salary increases and promotions are important, they are not the only effective rewards. Alternative rewards such as additional time off, opportunities for professional development, and public recognition can be just as motivating and lead to a more positive and productive work environment."
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that attendance should be mandatory, I firmly believe that going to classes should be optional for students. This perspective is rooted in the idea that university students are adults who should be responsible for their own learning.Firstly, optional attendance allows students to take ownership of their education. By giving them the freedom to choose when and how they learn, students can create a schedule that suits their individual needs and learning style. This autonomy can lead to increased motivation and engagement, as students are more likely to attend classes that genuinely interest them. Furthermore, with the rise of online learning platforms and digital resources, students can easily access course materials and learn at their own pace, even if they miss a class.Another significant advantage of optional attendance is that it acknowledges the diverse responsibilities and commitments of university students. Many students balance their academic pursuits with part-time jobs, family obligations, or other extracurricular activities. By not requiring mandatory attendance, students can manage their time more effectively, ensuring that they can meet their various responsibilities without compromising their academic performance.In conclusion, making class attendance optional for university students is a more effective and respectful approach to higher education. It recognizes the maturity and self-directed learning capabilities of students, while also accommodating the complexities of their lives outside the classroom. By trusting students to make their own decisions about attendance, universities can foster a more independent, motivated, and successful learner community.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;The debate about whether to live in a small town or a big city has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the tranquility and close-knit community of a small town, others opt for the hustle and bustle of a big city. As for me, I would prefer to live in a big city.Living in a big city offers numerous benefits, including better job opportunities, access to quality education, and a wide range of entertainment options. Big cities are hubs for various industries, providing a diverse range of career paths to choose from. Additionally, cities are often home to reputable universities and institutions, offering high-quality education and research opportunities. Furthermore, cities provide an array of entertainment options, including museums, theaters, and music venues, making them ideal for people who enjoy a vibrant cultural scene.On the other hand, small towns, while offering a peaceful and calm environment, often lack the amenities and opportunities that big cities provide. Limited job opportunities, fewer entertainment options, and restricted access to quality education are some of the drawbacks of living in a small town. Moreover, small towns can sometimes feel isolating, with limited social opportunities and a lack of diversity.In conclusion, while small towns have their charm, I believe that the benefits of living in a big city far outweigh those of living in a small town. The opportunities for personal and professional growth, the diversity, and the vibrant cultural scene make big cities an attractive option for me. Ultimately, the fast-paced and dynamic environment of a big city is where I would prefer to live, as it offers the perfect balance of work, leisure, and personal development.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The advent of computers has sparked a heated debate about their impact on our lives. While some argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I firmly believe that they have made life easier and more convenient. In my opinion, the benefits of computers far outweigh their drawbacks.Firstly, computers have enabled us to access a vast array of information at our fingertips. With the internet, we can now research, learn, and stay updated on current events with unprecedented ease. For instance, online shopping has made it possible to purchase goods and services from the comfort of our own homes, saving us time and effort. Moreover, computers have facilitated global communication, allowing us to connect with people from all over the world through social media, email, and video conferencing.Another significant advantage of computers is their ability to automate repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing up time for more creative and intellectual pursuits. For example, accounting software can handle financial transactions, while project management tools can help us stay organized and on track. This has greatly reduced the stress and complexity associated with manual labor, enabling us to focus on more strategic and high-value tasks.In conclusion, while some may argue that computers have introduced new complexities and stressors, such as cybercrime and information overload, I believe that their overall impact has been overwhelmingly positive. By providing unparalleled access to information, facilitating global communication, and automating routine tasks, computers have indeed made life easier and more convenient. As technology continues to evolve, I am excited to see the new possibilities and opportunities that computers will bring to our lives.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The advent of computers and modems has revolutionized the way we work, making it possible for office workers to perform their tasks from the comfort of their own homes. This phenomenon, known as telecommuting or working from home, has sparked a heated debate about its merits. In my opinion, I agree that working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees.On the one hand, working from home offers numerous benefits, including increased flexibility and work-life balance. Without the need to commute to an office, employees can manage their time more effectively, allowing them to attend to personal matters and prioritize their well-being. Additionally, working from home reduces the stress and fatigue associated with daily commutes, which can lead to improved productivity and job satisfaction.On the other hand, working from home can also lead to cost savings for both employees and employers. Employees can save on transportation costs, work attire, and lunch expenses, while employers can reduce overhead costs associated with maintaining large office spaces. Furthermore, working from home can also lead to a reduction in absenteeism and tardiness, as employees are more likely to work consistently and punctually in the comfort of their own homes.However, some may argue that working from home can lead to distractions and decreased motivation. Nevertheless, with the right mindset and self-discipline, employees can stay focused and motivated while working from home. In fact, many companies have successfully implemented telecommuting policies, reporting increased productivity and employee satisfaction. In conclusion, I firmly believe that working from home should be encouraged, as it offers numerous benefits for both employees and employers, and can lead to a more efficient, productive, and satisfied workforce.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has long been debated, with some arguing that their primary focus should be on conducting research, while others believe that their main responsibility is to educate students. In my opinion, I think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. First and foremost, a professor's primary responsibility is to impart knowledge and skills to their students. Universities are institutions of learning, and students attend them to acquire knowledge and skills that will enable them to succeed in their chosen careers. Professors are best positioned to provide this education, as they are experts in their fields and have a deep understanding of the subject matter. By focusing on teaching, professors can ensure that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for the workforce.Furthermore, while research is an important aspect of a professor's job, it should not come at the expense of their teaching responsibilities. In fact, research and teaching are not mutually exclusive, and many professors are able to conduct research that informs and enhances their teaching. By combining research and teaching, professors can provide students with a more comprehensive and up-to-date education. In addition, professors who focus on teaching are more likely to be available to provide guidance and support to their students, which is essential for student success. Professors who are overly focused on research may not have the time or energy to provide this level of support, which can negatively impact student outcomes. In conclusion, while research is an important aspect of a professor's job, I believe that their main role is to educate students. By prioritizing teaching, professors can ensure that students receive a high-quality education that prepares them for success.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The past century has witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, transforming the way we live, work, and interact. While technological progress has undoubtedly made significant contributions to modern society, I agree that it also has notable negative effects.On the one hand, technological progress has improved the quality of life, increased productivity, and facilitated global communication. The advent of the internet, mobile phones, and medical technologies has enabled rapid access to information,s and improved healthcare outcomes. Moreover, technological innovations have created new industries, jobs, and opportunities, driving economic growth and development.On the other hand, the negative consequences of technological progress cannot be overlooked. The over-reliance on technology has led to significant environmental degradation, with e-waste and energy consumption being major concerns. Furthermore, the proliferation of social media has contributed to the erosion of face-to-face communication skills,s and the spread of misinformation. Additionally, the automation of jobs has resulted in significant job losses, exacerbating income inequality and social unrest.In conclusion, while technological progress has been a driving force for development and improvement, its negative effects cannot be disregarded. It is crucial for individuals, organizations, and governments to acknowledge these consequences and work towards mitigating them. By implementing sustainable practices, promoting responsible technology use,s and investing in education and re-skilling programs, we can minimize the adverse effects of technological progress and ensure that its benefits are equitably distributed. Ultimately, a balanced approach to technological advancement is necessary to guarantee a prosperous and sustainable future for all.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The notion that ""prevention is better than cure"" is a widely accepted principle in the field of healthcare. In recent years, there has been a growing debate about whether a significant portion of a country's health budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures, rather than treatment. I strongly agree with this statement, as preventative measures can have a significant impact on reducing the burden of diseases and improving overall public health.Diverting a large proportion of the health budget towards health education and preventative measures can lead to a substantial reduction in the incidence of diseases. By educating the public about healthy habits, disease prevention, and early detection, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their health. Furthermore, preventative measures such as vaccinations, immunizations, and regular check-ups can help identify and mitigate health problems before they become severe. This approach can lead to a significant reduction in healthcare costs in the long run, as it reduces the need for expensive treatments and hospitalizations.Additionally, investing in health education and preventative measures can also have a positive impact on the economy. A healthy workforce is more productive, and a reduction in sick leaves and hospitalizations can lead to increased economic output. Moreover, a preventative approach can also reduce the strain on healthcare systems, allowing them to focus on providing quality care to those who need it most.In conclusion, diverting a large proportion of a country's health budget towards health education and preventative measures is a wise decision. By investing in prevention, countries can reduce the burden of diseases, improve public health, and reduce healthcare costs. While treatment is essential, prevention is indeed better than cure, and it is crucial that governments prioritize preventative measures to create a healthier and more sustainable healthcare system."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;The decision of where to live while attending university is a crucial one, as it can significantly impact a student's academic and social experience. University dormitories and community apartments are two popular options, each with its own set of advantages. On one hand, living in university dormitories offers several benefits. Firstly, it provides students with a convenient and immersive university experience, allowing them to be at the heart of campus life. Dormitories are typically within walking distance to classes, libraries, and other university facilities, making it easy for students to attend classes, study groups, and campus events. Additionally, dorms often come with built-in support systems, such as resident advisors and organized social activities, which can help students adjust to university life and make friends.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the community also has its advantages. For instance, apartments often provide more space and privacy compared to dorm rooms, allowing students to have more autonomy and independence. Moreover, living off-campus can give students a chance to interact with the local community, potentially leading to a more well-rounded experience. Apartments may also offer more flexible lease options and can be more cost-effective, especially when shared with roommates.Personally, I would prefer to live in university dormitories during my first year of study. This preference stems from the value I place on being fully engaged in campus life and having easy access to university resources. The support system and social opportunities provided by dorms are invaluable for a freshman student looking to establish a strong academic and social foundation. However, in subsequent years, I might consider moving to an apartment to experience the independence and community integration it offers. Ultimately, the choice between university housing and community apartments depends on individual priorities and circumstances, and what works best for one student may not be the same for another.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some may argue that zoos are outdated and inhumane, I believe that they play a vital role in conservation, education, and research. Firstly, zoos provide a safe and controlled environment for endangered species to thrive, allowing for breeding programs and the reintroduction of species into the wild. For instance, the California Condor Recovery Program, which was established in the 1980s, has been successful in increasing the population of this critically endangered species, thanks in part to the efforts of zoos.Moreover, zoos serve as important educational institutions, providing the public with an opportunity to learn about and appreciate wildlife. By observing and interacting with animals in a zoo setting, visitors can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world, which can inspire a love and respect for wildlife. This, in turn, can promote conservation efforts and motivate individuals to take action in protecting endangered species and their habitats.Additionally, zoos are involved in various research projects, which contribute to our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. The knowledge gained from these studies can inform conservation strategies and improve animal welfare in zoos and in the wild. For example, many zoos are involved in research on animal nutrition, enrichment, and habitat design, which can improve the lives of animals in captivity and in the wild.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Zoos are essential for conservation, education, and research, and their contributions to these areas are invaluable. While there may be some zoos that do not meet modern standards of animal care and welfare, many zoos are working tirelessly to promote the well-being of animals and to protect the world's biodiversity.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"When it comes to movies, I have always been drawn to those that are designed to make the audience think. These serious films, often referred to as thought-provoking or intellectual cinema, have a way of resonating with me on a deeper level. I prefer this type of movie over those that are primarily meant to amuse and entertain for several reasons.Firstly, serious movies tend to tackle complex issues and real-life problems, making them more relatable and impactful. For instance, films like ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Schindler's List"" shed light on significant historical events and social injustices, prompting viewers to reflect on their own values and beliefs. These movies not only educate but also inspire empathy and understanding.Another reason I prefer serious movies is that they often feature complex characters and storylines, which keep me engaged and invested in the narrative. Movies like ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" are great examples of this, with their intricate plots and exploration of philosophical themes. These films challenge my mind and encourage me to think critically about the ideas and concepts presented.In contrast, while entertaining movies can be enjoyable, they often lack substance and fail to leave a lasting impression. I find that after watching a purely entertaining film, I quickly forget the plot and characters, and the experience is reduced to mere fleeting amusement. On the other hand, serious movies stay with me long after the credits roll, haunting my thoughts and sparking important conversations. Overall, my preference for serious movies stems from their ability to educate, challenge, and inspire, making them a more rewarding and memorable cinematic experience."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;I strongly agree with the statement that the media pays too much attention to the personal lives of famous people, including public figures and celebrities. The constant scrutiny and invasion of their private lives have become a staple of modern media,society. It seems that every move they make, every relationship they have, and every mistake they commit is fodder for the press.One of the primary reasons for this excessive attention is the insatiable public appetite for gossip and scandal. The media caters to this demand by splashing sensational stories across the front pages of newspapers and magazines, and devoting hours of airtime to celebrity news on television. As a result, the public is bombarded with an endless stream of trivia and speculation about the personal lives of famous individuals, often at the expense of more substantial and meaningful news.Furthermore, this excessive focus on celebrity culture can have damaging consequences, both for the individuals involved and for society as a whole. It can lead to an unhealthy obsession with fame and materialism, and distract from more pressing issues that require public attention and engagement. For instance, while the media is busy dissecting the latest celebrity romance or feud, it may be neglecting its responsibility to report on important social, economic, and political issues that affect people's lives.In conclusion, the media's preoccupation with the personal lives of famous people is a misguided phenomenon that does more harm than good. Rather than indulging in idle gossip and speculation, the media should focus on providing thoughtful and informative reporting that enriches and educates the public. By doing so, it can help foster a more balanced and nuanced understanding of the world, and promote a more constructive and meaningful public discourse.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;When traveling to new destinations, many individuals often prioritize visiting museums as a vital part of their itinerary. In my opinion, people visit museums for several compelling reasons. Firstly, the primary motivation is to gain insight into the local culture, history, and heritage of the place they are visiting. Museums serve as treasure troves of a region's past, showcasing artifacts, artworks, and relics that narrate the story of its people and their traditions. For instance, the Louvre Museum in Paris is a magnet for tourists who flock to see the Mona Lisa and other French masterpieces, thereby experiencing the essence of French culture.Another significant reason people visit museums is for educational purposes. Museums offer a unique platform for learning, where visitors can engage with interactive exhibits, guided tours, and workshops that make complex concepts more accessible and entertaining. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., for example, attracts millions of visitors annually who are keen to explore the wonders of aviation and space exploration. This not only caters to the curiosity of adults but also inspires young minds, fostering a love for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).Lastly, people visit museums for the sheer pleasure of experiencing art and beauty. Art museums, in particular, provide a serene and inspiring environment where one can admire the creativity and skill of artists from around the world. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, with its vast collection of artworks spanning over 5,000 years, is a prime example, offering visitors a chance to marvel at the masterpieces of human creativity and imagination.In conclusion, visiting museums is an integral part of traveling, as it allows individuals to connect with the local culture, learn something new, and appreciate the aesthetic and historical significance of artworks and artifacts. Whether for educational enrichment, cultural immersion, or simple enjoyment, museums undoubtedly stand as captivating destinations that enrich one's travel experience.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The advent of technology has transformed the way we learn, and in the future, students may have the option to study from home using computers or televisions, or attend traditional schools. While studying from home may offer flexibility and convenience, I firmly believe that traditional schooling is the better option.First and foremost, traditional schools provide a structured and disciplined environment that fosters learning and personal growth. In a classroom setting, students are able to interact with teachers and peers, ask questions, and engage in discussions, which enhances their understanding of complex concepts. Additionally, traditional schools offer a wide range of extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs that help students develop important life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.In contrast, studying from home may lack the social interaction and human connection that is essential for emotional and psychological development. While technology can provide access to a wealth of information, it cannot replace the guidance and support of teachers, who can offer feedback, encouragement, and motivation. Moreover, studying from home may lead to distractions, procrastination, and lack of accountability, which can negatively impact academic performance.Furthermore, traditional schools provide students with a sense of community and belonging, which is vital for their emotional and mental well-being. Students learn important social skills, such as empathy, cooperation, and conflict resolution, which are essential for success in their personal and professional lives. In conclusion, while studying from home may offer flexibility, I believe that traditional schooling provides a more comprehensive and well-rounded education that prepares students for success in all aspects of life. Therefore, I would prefer to study in a traditional school setting, where I can interact with teachers and peers, engage in extracurricular activities, and develop important life skills.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The announcement of a large shopping center being built in our neighborhood has sparked a heated debate among residents. After careful consideration, I firmly oppose this plan. Firstly, the construction of such a massive complex would lead to a significant increase in traffic congestion in our area. Our neighborhood is already experiencing heavy traffic, and the influx of shoppers and delivery trucks would exacerbate the problem, making it difficult for residents to navigate the streets.Moreover, the shopping center would result in the destruction of green spaces and natural habitats. Our neighborhood is known for its picturesque parks and gardens, which provide a peaceful escape for residents. The loss of these areas would not only harm the environment but also diminish the aesthetic appeal of our community. Additionally, the shopping center would likely lead to the displacement of small, and local businesses, which are the backbone of our community. The influx of large chain stores would undermine the unique character of our neighborhood and drive out the very businesses that make it special.Finally, I am concerned about the potential noise pollution and disruption to residents' daily lives. The construction process would be noisy and disruptive, and the subsequent operation of the shopping center would generate excessive noise and light pollution. This would be particularly disturbing for residents who value the peaceful atmosphere of our neighborhood. In conclusion, while the prospect of a new shopping center may seem appealing, I firmly believe that the negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits. I urge the authorities to reconsider this plan and explore alternative solutions that prioritize the well-being and quality of life of our community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, one very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful is effective communication. Being able to clearly and concisely convey thoughts, ideas, and opinions is crucial in both personal and professional settings. Effective communication enables individuals to build strong relationships, negotiate, and resolve conflicts, ultimately leading to greater success.For instance, in the workplace, good communication skills are essential for teamwork, leadership, and client relationships. A manager who can clearly articulate expectations and provide constructive feedback can motivate employees and increase productivity. Similarly, in personal relationships, effective communication helps to avoid misunderstandings, resolve conflicts, and foster deeper connections. Moreover, in a globalized world where people from diverse backgrounds interact, being able to communicate across cultural and linguistic barriers is a highly valued skill.Furthermore, with the rise of digital communication, being able to express oneself in writing, such as through emails, reports, and social media, is also vital. Many jobs require writing as a primary form of communication, and those who can write clearly and persuasively have a significant advantage. For example, a marketing professional who can craft compelling messages can drive sales and brand engagement, while a journalist who can write engaging articles can inform and influence public opinion.In conclusion, learning effective communication is key to achieving success in today's world. It enhances personal and professional relationships, improves teamwork and leadership, and opens up broader opportunities in a global and digital landscape. By mastering the art of communication, individuals can express themselves more effectively, build stronger connections, and ultimately achieve their goals more efficiently. As such, it is an indispensable skill that should be prioritized by anyone seeking to make a meaningful impact in their chosen field.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Groups or organizations play a vital role in the lives of many individuals, offering a sense of belonging, support, and purpose. These collective entities are important to people for several reasons. Firstly, they provide a platform for like-minded individuals to come together and share common interests. For instance, a book club or a sports team allows members to engage in activities they are passionate about, while also fostering social connections and friendships.Moreover, groups or organizations often serve as a source of emotional support and guidance. Support groups, such as those for people dealing with mental health issues or chronic illnesses, offer a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and receive encouragement from others who understand their struggles. This sense of community and camaraderie can be incredibly empowering, helping people to cope with challenges and overcome obstacles.Additionally, groups or organizations can provide opportunities for personal growth and development. Professional associations, for example, offer training, workshops, and networking events that enable members to enhance their skills, stay updated on industry trends, and advance in their careers. Similarly, volunteer groups or charitable organizations allow individuals to contribute to a cause they care about, developing a sense of purpose and fulfillment.In conclusion, groups or organizations are essential to people's lives as they offer a sense of belonging, support, and opportunities for growth. Whether it's a social club, a support group, or a professional association, these collective entities bring people together, providing a platform for connection, learning, and contribution. By being part of a group or organization, individuals can expand their social networks, develop new skills, and find meaning and purpose in their lives. Ultimately, the importance of groups or organizations lies in their ability to enrich people's lives, fostering a sense of community and shared experience.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The recent announcement by the government to build a new university has sparked a heated debate about its potential location. Our community has been cited as a prime candidate, and while it presents several advantages, it also has its share of disadvantages. On the one hand, establishing a new university in our community would bring numerous benefits. For instance, it would create a plethora of job opportunities for locals, both during the construction phase and after the university's operation commences. This would not only boost the local economy but also contribute to the reduction of unemployment rates.Moreover, a new university would attract a diverse range of students and faculty members, enriching the community's cultural landscape. The influx of young, educated individuals would also stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship, potentially leading to the establishment of new businesses and startups. Furthermore, the university would provide our community with access to advanced educational facilities, enabling local students to pursue higher education without having to relocate to other areas.On the other hand, there are also several disadvantages to consider. The construction of a new university would likely lead to an increase in traffic and congestion, potentially disrupting the community's tranquil environment. Additionally, the demand for housing and other services would skyrocket, leading to higher costs of living and potentially pricing out long-time residents. The strain on local resources, such as water and energy, would also be a concern, especially if the university's infrastructure is not designed with sustainability in mind.In conclusion, while establishing a new university in our community presents several compelling advantages, including job creation and cultural enrichment, it also raises important concerns about traffic, cost of living, and resource management. Careful planning and consideration of these factors would be essential to ensure that the benefits of the university outweigh its drawbacks and that it becomes a valuable and sustainable addition to our community.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The debate over who should bear the cost of a college education has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others argue that it is up to the individual to finance their own education. In this essay, I will argue that the government should provide financial support to make college education more accessible to its citizens.On the one hand, providing free college education can have numerous benefits for individuals and society as a whole. It can lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which can contribute to the country's economic growth and competitiveness. Moreover, free college education can help reduce income inequality by providing equal opportunities for people from all walks of life to pursue higher education. This, in turn, can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is essential for a healthy democracy.On the other hand, some argue that individuals should be responsible for financing their own education. They believe that this will encourage people to value their education more and make informed decisions about their academic pursuits. However, this argument assumes that everyone has the financial means to pursue higher education, which is not the case. Many students have to take on significant debt to finance their education, which can be a burden for years to come.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that the government should provide financial support to make college education more accessible to its citizens. By doing so, it can help create a more educated and skilled workforce, reduce income inequality, and promote social mobility. Ultimately, providing free or low-cost college education is an investment in the country's future and can have long-term benefits for individuals, society, and the economy.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";I disagree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is true that excessive television watching can lead to a decline in face-to-face interaction, the relationship between television and communication is more complex than that. In fact, television can also serve as a tool to facilitate communication and bonding among friends and family.For instance, watching a favorite TV show or movie together can provide a common topic for discussion and conversation. Families can gather around the TV to watch a sporting event or a popular awards show, and use the experience as a way to spend quality time together. Moreover, television can also provide a shared cultural experience, with many people discussing the latest episodes of popular shows or debating the issues presented on news programs.Furthermore, television can also be used as a tool for education and learning, which can, in turn, promote communication and discussion. Documentaries, historical dramas, and educational programs can spark interesting conversations and debates among friends and family, and encourage critical thinking and analysis. In addition, with the advent of modern technology, people can now watch TV together while being physically apart, using platforms such as Netflix party or social media, and still engage in discussions and conversations about the shows they are watching.In conclusion, while excessive TV watching can be detrimental to communication, it is not accurate to say that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. On the contrary, television can be a valuable tool to facilitate communication, to promote bonding and to provide shared experiences. When used in moderation, television can be a positive force in our social lives.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";I strongly agree with the statement that attending a live performance is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. There are several reasons that support this opinion. Firstly, the atmosphere and energy of a live event are unparalleled. When attending a concert, play, or sporting event in person, the excitement and enthusiasm of the crowd create an electric atmosphere that is impossible to replicate on television. For example, attending a music festival like Coachella or Lollapalooza is a unique experience that allows fans to connect with their favorite artists and fellow music lovers in a way that watching a live stream or recording cannot match.Another reason why live performances are more enjoyable is the sense of community and shared experience that they provide. When watching a live event, spectators are surrounded by others who are equally invested in the performance, creating a sense of camaraderie and collective excitement. This is particularly evident at sporting events, where the roar of the crowd and the thrill of victory or defeat are experienced collectively, making the event feel more dynamic and engaging.Furthermore, live performances often offer a more immersive and interactive experience than television. At a play, for instance, the audience is fully engaged with the actors, experiencing the drama and emotion of the performance up close. In contrast, watching the same play on television can feel distant and detached, lacking the intimacy and immediacy of a live performance. Overall, attending a live performance offers a unique and exhilarating experience that surpasses the enjoyment of watching the same event on television. The energy, community, and immersion of a live event make it an unbeatable experience that is not to be missed.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The world has been heavily reliant on fossil fuels, such as gases, oil, and coal, for centuries. However, with the increasing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, the shift towards renewable resources of energy has gained momentum. I agree that renewable resources of energy, as sun, wind, and water, will soon replace fossil fuels as the primary source of energy.Firstly, the technology for harnessing renewable energy has become more efficient and cost-effective, making it a viable alternative to fossil fuels. For instance, the cost of solar panels has decreased significantly over the years, allowing households and businesses to adopt solar energy. Moreover, advancements in wind turbine technology have increased energy production, making wind energy a significant contributor to the global energy mix.Secondly, the environmental benefits of renewable energy far outweigh those of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels release harmful greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and air pollution. In contrast, renewable energy sources are clean and produce little to no emissions, making them a more sustainable option. As the world becomes more conscious of the need to reduce carbon emissions, governments and companies are investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure.Lastly, many countries have set ambitious targets to transition to renewable energy, and some have already made significant strides. For example, Norway and Costa Rica are close to achieving 100% renewable energy, while countries like China and the US are investing heavily in solar and wind energy. As the demand for renewable energy increases, the cost will decrease, making it more accessible to people around the world. In conclusion, with the advancements in technology, environmental benefits, and government initiatives, I firmly believe that renewable resources of energy will soon replace fossil fuels as the primary source of energy.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;I strongly disagree with the point of view that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. While it is true that humans require land for various purposes, the preservation of endangered species is crucial for maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystem. The loss of biodiversity can have severe and long-lasting consequences, including the degradation of natural habitats and the disruption of food chains.Moreover, many endangered species play a vital role in maintaining the health of our environment. For example, bees are essential for pollination, and their decline can have devastating effects on agricultural production. Similarly, wolves help to regulate prey populations, which can prevent overgrazing and maintain the quality of vegetation. By preserving land for these species, we are ultimately ensuring the long-term sustainability of our own food supplies and ecosystems.Furthermore, the idea that human needs and environmental conservation are mutually exclusive is a false dichotomy. In many cases, sustainable land-use practices can meet human needs while also protecting endangered species. For instance, agroforestry and permaculture can provide food and income for local communities while maintaining biodiversity. Additionally, eco-tourism can generate revenue and create jobs while promoting the conservation of natural habitats.In conclusion, saving land for endangered animals is not a luxury, but a necessity. The preservation of biodiversity is essential for maintaining the health of our planet, and it is our responsibility to ensure that human needs are met in a sustainable and environmentally-conscious manner. By adopting sustainable land-use practices and prioritizing conservation, we can meet human needs while also protecting the natural world for future generations.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The debate about the most effective location for learning a foreign language has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some argue that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial, others disagree, citing the potential drawbacks and challenges associated with this approach. In this essay, I will argue that learning a foreign language in its original country is indeed more beneficial than learning it in a country with another language.Firstly, learning a foreign language in its original country provides an immersive environment that facilitates language acquisition. Surrounding oneself with native speakers, authentic materials, and cultural practices enhances the learning experience, allowing learners to pick up nuances and subtleties of the language that may be lost in a non-native setting. For instance, learning Spanish in Spain or Mandarin in China offers unparalleled opportunities to engage with the language in everyday situations, such as ordering food, navigating public transportation, or participating in local festivals.Furthermore, learning a foreign language in its original country offers a unique chance to develop cultural competence alongside language proficiency. By being exposed to the customs, traditions, and values of the target language, learners can gain a deeper understanding of the language's context and develop a more authentic communication style. This, in turn, can enhance their ability to interact effectively with native speakers and foster meaningful relationships.In conclusion, while there may be some challenges associated with learning a foreign language in its original country, such as initial culture shock or difficulties adjusting to a new environment, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. The immersive environment, cultural immersion, and authentic learning experiences make learning a foreign language in its original country a more effective and rewarding experience than learning it in a country with another language. Therefore, I strongly agree that learning a foreign language in its original country is the most beneficial approach for language learners.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The debate about whether physical exercise should be a mandatory part of every school day or if students should focus solely on academic studies has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required component of every school day. Physical exercise offers numerous benefits for students, including improved physical health, enhanced mental well-being, and better concentration in class. Regular physical activity has been proven to reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, and other health problems, setting students up for a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, boost mood, and reduce stress levels, all of which are essential for academic success. By incorporating physical exercise into the daily school routine, students will be more focused, energized, and motivated to learn.In contrast, spending the whole school day on academic studies may lead to burnout, decreased motivation, and a lack of physical activity. While academic studies are undoubtedly crucial, an overemphasis on them can result in an imbalance in students' overall development. Physical exercise provides a much-needed break from the academic rigors, allowing students to recharge and return to their studies with renewed enthusiasm and productivity.Moreover, making physical exercise a required part of every school day can also promote teamwork, discipline, and social skills. Team sports and physical activities encourage students to work together, build relationships, and develop essential life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and time management. In conclusion, I strongly agree that physical exercise should be a mandatory part of every school day. The benefits of physical activity, ranging from improved physical and mental health to enhanced academic performance and social skills, make it an essential component of a well-rounded education. By incorporating physical exercise into the daily school routine, we can raise healthier, happier, and more well-rounded students.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;The concept of teenagers having jobs while still being students is a common phenomenon in many countries. In my opinion, I believe that this is a good idea, as it provides numerous benefits for the teenagers. Firstly, having a job allows teenagers to gain valuable work experience and develop essential skills such as time management, communication, and teamwork. These skills are crucial for their future careers and can give them a competitive edge in the job market.Additionally, working while studying helps teenagers to become more independent and responsible. They learn to manage their finances, prioritize tasks, and balance their work and academic commitments. This sense of responsibility can also translate to other areas of their lives, such as their relationships and personal goals. Moreover, having a job can provide teenagers with a sense of purpose and motivation, which can lead to improved academic performance and a stronger work ethic.However, it is essential to note that the type of job and the number of working hours are crucial factors to consider. Teenagers should not be overworked or exploited, and their jobs should not interfere with their academic commitments. Ideally, part-time jobs or internships that complement their studies can be highly beneficial. In conclusion, having a job while being a student can be a great opportunity for teenagers to gain valuable experience, develop essential skills, and become more independent and responsible. As long as the job is balanced with their academic commitments, I firmly believe that it is a good idea that can have a positive impact on their future careers and personal growth.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The debate about the role of zoos in society has sparked intense discussion, with some people believing they serve a useful function, while others think it's cruel and wrong to confine animals in zoos. After careful consideration, I agree with the latter viewpoint that it's cruel and wrong to keep animals in zoos.Firstly, zoos are inherently unnatural environments for animals. They are taken from their natural habitats and confined to small, artificial spaces, which can lead to stress, boredom, and other behavioral problems. This can be detrimental to the physical and mental health of the animals, and it's unacceptable to prioritize human entertainment over animal welfare.Furthermore, zoos often fail to provide the space and stimulation that animals need to thrive. Many zoos are small and lack the resources to provide adequate care for the animals, leading to inadequate living conditions and poor treatment. This can result in animals developing abnormal behaviors, such as pacing or self-mutilation, which are clear indicators of distress and suffering.Additionally, with the advancement of technology and conservation efforts, there are now alternative and more effective ways to learn about and protect animals, such as wildlife documentaries, national parks, and conservation centers. These alternatives allow people to appreciate and learn about animals in their natural habitats, without the need for captivity.In conclusion, while some people may argue that zoos serve a useful function in terms of education and conservation, I firmly believe that the harm caused by confining animals in zoos outweighs any potential benefits. It's our responsibility to prioritize animal welfare and treat them with respect and kindness, rather than exploiting them for human entertainment. Therefore, I strongly agree that it's cruel and wrong to confine animals in zoos.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When it comes to studying, individuals have different preferences. Some students thrive in solo study environments, while others excel in group settings. As for me, I prefer to study with a group of students. This preference stems from the numerous benefits that come with collaborative learning.Firstly, studying in a group allows for the sharing of knowledge and ideas. When working together, each member brings their unique perspective and understanding of the material, which can lead to a more comprehensive grasp of the subject. For instance, in a group study session, one member may be able to explain a complex concept in a way that resonates with others, facilitating a deeper understanding.Moreover, group study sessions foster healthy competition and motivation. When surrounded by peers who are also striving to learn, it creates an environment where everyone is encouraged to perform at their best. This collective drive can be a powerful motivator, pushing individuals to stay on track and pursue their academic goals with renewed vigor.Another significant advantage of group studying is the opportunity to develop essential teamwork and communication skills. By working together to solve problems or complete assignments, students learn how to articulate their thoughts, listen to others, and collaborate towards a common goal. These skills are invaluable not only in academic settings but also in professional and personal life.In conclusion, while solo study has its advantages, I firmly believe that studying with a group of students offers a more dynamic and beneficial learning experience. The exchange of ideas, the motivation derived from collective effort, and the development of crucial life skills make group studying a preferable and effective way to achieve academic success.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;When it comes to socializing, people often have different preferences. Some individuals enjoy spending time with a small, intimate group of one or two close friends, while others thrive in larger social circles with numerous acquaintances. Both approaches have their advantages.On the one hand, spending time with a small number of close friends allows for deeper, more meaningful relationships. With fewer people to divide attention among, conversations can be more in-depth and personal, fostering a sense of trust and camaraderie. Additionally, smaller groups often lead to more organized and planned activities, which can be less stressful and more enjoyable. For example, a small group of friends can easily plan a weekend getaway or a quiet dinner party, which can be a great way to relax and strengthen bonds.On the other hand, having a large number of friends provides a wider range of social opportunities and experiences. With more people in a social circle, there is a greater diversity of interests, hobbies, and personalities, which can lead to a more dynamic and exciting social life. Moreover, a larger social network can also provide a sense of belonging and support, as there are more people to turn to in times of need. For instance, a big group of friends can organize a lively party or a fun outing, which can be an exhilarating experience.Personally, I prefer spending time with a small number of close friends. I value the depth and intimacy that comes with having a smaller, more tight-knit group of friends. With a smaller circle, I can engage in more meaningful conversations, share personal thoughts and feelings, and build stronger relationships. While I acknowledge the benefits of having a large social network, I believe that the rewards of close, lasting friendships outweigh the advantages of a more extensive social circle. Ultimately, the choice between spending time with a few close friends or a large number of acquaintances depends on individual preferences and priorities.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The debate on whether government should allocate more funds to improve roads and highways or to enhance public transportation has been ongoing. In my opinion, I believe that the government should prioritize spending more money on improving public transportation. Investing in public transportation, as buses, trains, and subways, offers numerous benefits to the environment, economy, and society as a whole. For instance, a well-developed public transportation system reduces traffic congestion, which in turn decreases air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This leads to a cleaner and healthier environment for citizens. Additionally, efficient public transportation systems promote economic growth by providing people with easy access to employment, education, and other essential services.On the other hand, spending more money on improving roads and highways may seem beneficial in the short term, but it can lead to increased dependence on personal vehicles, which contributes to traffic congestion and environmental degradation. Furthermore, the construction and maintenance of roads and highways are costly and may divert funds from other essential public services.In conclusion, while both options have their merits, I firmly believe that the government should spend more money on improving public transportation. By doing so, it can create a more sustainable, efficient, and equitable transportation system that benefits the environment, economy, and society. It is essential for the government to prioritize the development of public transportation to create a better future for its citizens. By investing in buses, trains, and subways, the government can reduce its carbon footprint, promote economic growth, and improve the overall quality of life for its citizens.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;I agree with the statement that animals should be free and people should not keep them in zoos. Keeping animals in zoos is a form of captivity that deprives them of their natural habitats and freedom. One of the primary reasons for this is that zoos cannot provide the same level of space and environment that animals would have in the wild. For example, elephants in zoos have been known to exhibit abnormal behaviors such as pacing and swaying due to the lack of space and stimulation.Another reason is that keeping animals in zoos can be harmful to their physical and mental health. Many animals in zoos suffer from stress, anxiety, and depression due to the confinement and lack of natural social interactions. Additionally, zoos often breed animals in captivity, which can lead to inbreeding and genetic problems. For instance, many big cat species in zoos have been found to have genetic disorders due to inbreeding.Furthermore, with the advancement of technology and conservation efforts, there are alternative ways to learn about and appreciate animals without keeping them in zoos. Documentaries, wildlife reserves, and sanctuaries are examples of places where animals can thrive in their natural habitats while still allowing people to observe and learn from them. In conclusion, keeping animals in zoos is not only inhumane but also unnecessary. Animals should be free to roam and live in their natural habitats, and people should explore alternative ways to learn about and appreciate these amazing creatures. By doing so, we can promote the well-being and conservation of animals, rather than exploiting them for human entertainment.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;As a nation, it is imperative to prioritize research centers that cater to the immediate needs and potential of our country. Given the choice between a center for business research and one for research in agriculture, I strongly recommend the latter. The primary reason for this recommendation is that agriculture is a vital sector that employs a significant portion of our population and contributes substantially to our national income.A center for agricultural research would enable our country to improve farming techniques, increase crop yields, and develop resistance to pests and diseases. This, in turn, would lead to enhanced food security, a critical aspect of national stability and development. Furthermore, such a center could focus on sustainable farming practices, which are essential for environmental conservation and mitigating the effects of climate change.In contrast, while a business research center would undoubtedly have its benefits, such as promoting entrepreneurship and economic growth, it may not address the fundamental needs of our country as directly as an agricultural research center. Our country's economic development is closely tied to its ability to feed its population and manage its natural resources sustainably. By prioritizing agricultural research, we can ensure a more stable and secure future for our citizens.Additionally, the outcomes of agricultural research can have a direct and positive impact on the lives of rural communities, who are often the most vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity. By boosting agricultural productivity, we can empower these communities economically and socially, contributing to a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities across our country. Therefore, establishing a center for research in agriculture is not only a practical choice but a socially responsible one, aligning with the broader goals of sustainable development and human well-being.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;"The age-old adage ""everyone learns differently"" has been proven time and time again to be unequivocally true. As individuals, we each possess unique learning styles that cater to our distinct needs and preferences. For me, the most effective method of learning is by doing things. This hands-on approach has consistently yielded the best results, allowing me to grasp and retain information with greater ease.One notable example that illustrates the efficacy of this method is my experience in a cooking class. Rather than simply reading a recipe or listening to the instructor's verbal instructions, I was able to learn the intricacies of preparing a complex dish by actively participating in the cooking process. By doing, I was able to develop a deeper understanding of the various techniques and ingredients involved, which in turn, enabled me to recreate the dish with confidence.In contrast, while reading and listening can provide a foundation of knowledge, they often lack the interactive and immersive qualities that hands-on learning affords. For instance, when studying for a science exam, merely reading about a concept or listening to a lecture can lead to a superficial understanding, whereas conducting experiments or engaging in lab work allows for a more nuanced comprehension of the subject matter.In conclusion, learning by doing has proven to be the most effective method for me. By engaging in practical, hands-on activities, I am able to absorb and retain information with greater facility, while also developing valuable skills and confidence in the process. As such, I firmly believe that this approach to learning is not only beneficial but essential for individuals like myself who thrive in interactive and immersive environments."
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has revolutionized the way people travel, offering unprecedented freedom to explore distant destinations. On one hand, the affordability of air travel has made it possible for ordinary people to experience different cultures, enjoy exotic vacations, and connect with family and friends living abroad. This increased mobility has not only enriched personal lives but also contributed to the growth of the tourism industry, boosting local economies and creating jobs.On the other hand, critics argue that the proliferation of cheap air travel has a detrimental impact on the environment. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the increased demand for air travel has led to a substantial rise in carbon footprint. Moreover, proponents of expensive air travel argue that by making air travel more costly, the demand would decrease, leading to a reduction in emissions and mitigating the environmental problems associated with air travel.In my opinion, while environmental concerns are valid and need to be addressed, completely discouraging air travel through higher prices may not be the most equitable solution. Instead, airlines and governments could explore more sustainable practices such as investing in cleaner fuels, as well as implementing carbon offset programs that allow travelers to compensate for their emissions. Additionally, improving fuel efficiency and reducing waste in the aviation industry can also significantly reduce its environmental impact. Therefore, a balanced approach that considers both the social benefits of affordable air travel and the need to protect the environment is necessary. By adopting sustainable practices and technologies, we can ensure that the freedom to travel is preserved for future generations while minimizing its harmful effects on the planet.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation. This is because public transportation offers numerous benefits to the environment, the economy, and society as a whole.Firstly, investing in public transportation can significantly reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. By providing efficient and reliable bus, train, and subway systems, people are encouraged to leave their cars behind, resulting in a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction in traffic jams. This, in turn, can improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and make cities more livable.Secondly, a well-developed public transportation system can boost economic growth by connecting people to employment opportunities, educational institutions, and other essential services. It can also increase the attractiveness of a city to businesses, tourists, and residents, thereby stimulating local economies. Furthermore, public transportation can help to reduce social inequality by providing affordable and accessible transportation options to low-income communities.In contrast, spending more money on roads and highways may provide short-term benefits, such as reduced traffic congestion, but it can also lead to urban sprawl, increased dependence on fossil fuels, and a range of negative environmental impacts. Moreover, the construction and maintenance of roads and highways can be extremely costly, and the funds allocated to these projects could be better spent on developing sustainable and efficient public transportation systems.In conclusion, governments should prioritize spending on improving public transportation over roads and highways. By doing so, they can create more sustainable, equitable, and economically vibrant cities, which can improve the quality of life for their citizens.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;When it comes to studying, students have different preferences. Some prefer to study alone, while others enjoy studying with a group of students. As for me, I prefer to study with a group of students. There are several reasons that support my preference.Firstly, studying in a group allows for the sharing of knowledge and ideas. When I study with my peers, we can discuss and clarify any concepts that we do not understand. For instance, if I am struggling with a particular math problem, my friends can help me work through it and explain the solution in a way that makes sense to me. This collaborative approach to learning not only helps me to understand the material better but also enables me to retain the information more effectively.Another reason I prefer group study is that it provides an opportunity for peer teaching. When we study together, we can take turns teaching each other about different topics. This helps to reinforce our own understanding of the subject matter and also enables us to learn from one another's strengths and weaknesses. For example, if one of my friends is particularly skilled in a certain subject, they can provide valuable insights and tips that can help me to improve my own performance.Lastly, studying in a group promotes accountability and motivation. When I study alone, it can be easy to get distracted or procrastinate. However, when I study with a group, we can motivate and encourage each other to stay focused and on track. We can also set goals and challenges for ourselves and work together to achieve them. Overall, I believe that studying with a group of students is more beneficial than studying alone, as it provides opportunities for knowledge sharing, peer teaching, and motivation.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";"The debate over whether human activity is harming or improving the Earth has sparked intense discussion in recent years. In my opinion, I firmly believe that human activity is causing more harm than good to the planet. One of the primary reasons for this is the alarming rate of pollution. The excessive burning of fossil fuels and industrial waste has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in climate change and global warming. For instance, the devastating wildfires in Australia and the melting of polar ice caps are stark reminders of the catastrophic consequences of human actions.Another significant concern is deforestation and habitat destruction. Human activities such as logging, mining, and urbanization have led to the clearance of vast areas of forests, resulting in loss of biodiversity and extinction of numerous species. The Amazon rainforest, for example, is often referred to as the ""lungs of the Earth"" due to its crucial role in producing oxygen, yet it is being destroyed at an unprecedented rate. Furthermore, human activities such as overfishing and plastic pollution are also degrading the world's oceans, threatening the delicate balance of marine ecosystems.On the other hand, some may argue that human activity has improved the Earth through technological advancements and innovative solutions. However, I believe that these benefits are greatly outweighed by the negative consequences of human actions. It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the harm caused by human activity, such as reducing our carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and implementing sustainable practices. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to protect the planet and ensure a livable future for generations to come."
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";When it comes to deciding between supporting the arts or protecting the environment, I believe that the company would choose to protect the environment. This decision is driven by the growing awareness and urgency of environmental issues, as well as the potential long-term benefits for the company's reputation and bottom line.Firstly, environmental protection is an issue that affects not only the present but also the future of our planet. Companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of sustainability and their role in mitigating climate change, pollution, and conservation. By supporting environmental causes, the company can demonstrate its commitment to corporate social responsibility and enhance its public image. For instance, a company like Patagonia, which is known for its environmental activism, has seen significant brand loyalty and customer appreciation due to its efforts in protecting the environment.Secondly, investing in environmental protection can have tangible benefits for the company. For example, reducing carbon footprint and implementing sustainable practices can lead to cost savings in the long run. Moreover, governments and consumers are increasingly favoring companies that adhere to strict environmental standards, which can lead to new business opportunities and market shares. Companies like Tesla, which pioneered electric vehicles, have not only contributed to reducing carbon emissions but have also revolutionized the automotive industry.In contrast, while supporting the arts is valuable for community engagement and cultural enrichment, it may not yield the same level of direct business benefits as environmental protection. However, it's also worth noting that some companies may choose to support the arts as a way to promote creativity, employee morale, and community development, which can indirectly benefit the company.In conclusion, given the current global focus on sustainability and the direct business benefits associated with environmental stewardship, I believe that the company is more likely to choose protecting the environment. This choice not only aligns with growing societal expectations but also positions the company for long-term success and sustainability.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;When working closely with others, there are several important characteristics of a co-worker that can greatly impact the quality of collaboration and overall job satisfaction. In my opinion, two of the most essential characteristics of a co-worker are reliability and effective communication skills.Firstly, reliability is crucial in a co-worker as it ensures that tasks are completed on time and to a high standard. A reliable co-worker is someone who follows through on their commitments, takes responsibility for their work, and is punctual. For instance, if I'm working on a project with a colleague who consistently misses deadlines, it can cause delays and extra workload for others, ultimately affecting the overall outcome. On the other hand, a reliable co-worker allows for seamless collaboration, builds trust, and enables the team to achieve its goals efficiently.Secondly, effective communication skills are vital in a co-worker as they facilitate clear understanding, prevent misunderstandings, and foster a positive work environment. A co-worker with good communication skills can articulate their ideas, listen actively, and provide constructive feedback. For example, in a team meeting, a co-worker who can clearly explain their thoughts and opinions can help the team make informed decisions and avoid confusion. Furthermore, good communication skills also involve being approachable, empathetic, and respectful, which helps to build strong working relationships and resolve conflicts in a constructive manner.In conclusion, reliability and effective communication skills are essential characteristics of a co-worker. These traits enable teams to work efficiently, build trust, and achieve their objectives. By working with someone who possesses these qualities, we can ensure a productive and positive work environment, leading to greater job satisfaction and success.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;I disagree with the quotation that when people succeed, it is because of hard work and luck has nothing to do with success. While hard work is undoubtedly a crucial factor in achieving success, luck also plays a significant role. Many successful individuals have attributed their accomplishments to a combination of dedication and fortunate circumstances.For instance, consider the story of J.K. Rowling, who wrote the first Harry Potter book as a single mother living on welfare. Her hard work and perseverance are undeniable, but she has also spoken about the luck involved in meeting the right publisher at the right time. If her manuscript had not been picked up by Bloomsbury, the series may not have become the global phenomenon it is today.Additionally, many entrepreneurs and business leaders have spoken about the role of luck in their success. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, and Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, both acknowledge that being in the right place at the right time, with the right idea, was a key factor in their companies' success. This is not to say that hard work was not involved, but rather that luck played a significant role in their achievements.In conclusion, while hard work is essential for success, it is unrealistic to dismiss the role of luck entirely. Many successful individuals have benefited from a combination of dedication and fortunate circumstances. Therefore, I firmly believe that luck has a significant impact on success, and it is not solely the result of hard work. By acknowledging the interplay between hard work and luck, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of what it takes to achieve success.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we learn, making distance learning and online computer classes a viable alternative to traditional classroom learning. In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards online learning, and it is argued that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning. This essay will examine the benefits of online learning and argue that it is a more effective and efficient way of learning.One of the primary advantages of online learning is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace, and access course materials at any time, from any location. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who have work or family commitments, or those who live in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Additionally, online learning platforms provide a wide range of resources, including video lectures, interactive simulations, and online discussions, which can enhance the learning experience.Another significant benefit of online learning is cost-effectiveness. Online courses often have lower tuition fees compared to traditional classroom-based courses, and students can save on transportation and accommodation costs. Furthermore, online learning reduces the need for physical infrastructure, such as classrooms and libraries, which can lead to significant cost savings for educational institutions.Moreover, online learning provides students with the opportunity to interact with a global community of learners, which can broaden their perspectives and enhance their cultural understanding. Online discussions and forums also provide students with the opportunity to engage with instructors and peers, promoting collaborative learning and problem-solving.In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes offer a flexible, cost-effective, and interactive way of learning, which can enhance the educational experience. While traditional classroom learning has its benefits, online learning provides students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace, access a wide range of resources, and interact with a global community of learners. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online learning will become an increasingly popular and effective way of learning.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some argue that mandatory attendance is essential for academic success, others believe that it should be optional, allowing students to manage their time effectively. In my opinion, I firmly believe that attending classes should be optional for university students.First and foremost, one of the primary reasons for supporting optional attendance is that it fosters independence and self-motivation among students. University students are adults, and as such, they should be responsible for their own learning and time management. By not requiring them to attend classes, students can learn to prioritize their tasks, set goals, and develop a sense of accountability. This, in turn, enables them to become more autonomous and self-directed learners.Another significant advantage of optional attendance is that it accommodates different learning styles and needs. Some students may learn more effectively through online resources, self-study, or hands-on experiences, and may not require traditional classroom instruction. Moreover, students with disabilities, work commitments, or family obligations may face difficulties in attending classes regularly. By providing the option to attend classes or not, universities can cater to diverse student needs and promote inclusivity.In conclusion, while mandatory attendance may have its benefits, I firmly believe that optional attendance is more beneficial for university students. It promotes independence, accommodates different learning styles, and fosters a sense of responsibility among students. By giving students the autonomy to choose when and how they learn, universities can empower them to take charge of their academic journey and become more effective learners. Ultimately, this approach can lead to better academic outcomes, increased student satisfaction, and a more inclusive learning environment.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, people often find themselves torn between the charms of small towns and the vibrancy of big cities. While some individuals prefer the quiet, intimate setting of a small town, I firmly believe that living in a big city is the more desirable option. First and foremost, big cities offer a diverse range of job opportunities, which is a significant factor for career-driven individuals. The multitude of industries and companies present in urban areas provides a platform for professional growth and development, allowing individuals to explore various career paths and network with like-minded professionals. In contrast, small towns often have limited job opportunities, which can lead to stagnation and boredom.Another advantage of living in a big city is the access to superior amenities and services. Cities are typically equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure, including world-class hospitals, schools, and transportation systems. Additionally, big cities are often cultural and entertainment hubs, offering a wide range of recreational activities, such as museums, theaters, and music venues. This diversity of experiences and exposure to different cultures and lifestyles is unparalleled in small towns.Lastly, living in a big city fosters independence and self-reliance. The fast-paced and often anonymous nature of city life encourages individuals to be self-sufficient and adaptable, skills that are invaluable in today's fast-changing world. While small towns may offer a stronger sense of community, it is often at the expense of personal freedom and autonomy.In conclusion, while small towns have their own unique charms, I believe that the benefits of living in a big city far outweigh those of living in a small town. With their diverse job opportunities, superior amenities, and independence-fostering environment, big cities are the ideal place for individuals seeking personal and professional growth.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;The migration of young people from rural areas to cities is a widespread phenomenon in many countries. In my opinion, one of the primary reasons for this trend is the limited availability of educational and job opportunities in rural areas. Cities, on the other hand, offer a wider range of universities, colleges, and job markets, attracting young people seeking better prospects. Additionally, cities provide exposure to diverse cultures, lifestyles, and experiences, which can be beneficial for personal growth and development.Another reason for this migration is the perceived higher standard of living in cities. Cities often have better infrastructure, amenities, and services, making them more appealing to young people. Furthermore, the idea of independence and freedom that comes with city living can be a significant draw for young people eager to leave their family homes and start their own lives.While there are disadvantages to this migration, such as the strain on city resources and the potential for rural areas to become underpopulated, I believe the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The influx of young, educated, and skilled individuals can contribute to the economic growth and development of cities. Moreover, the experience and knowledge gained in cities can eventually be taken back to rural areas, contributing to their development as well.In conclusion, the migration of young people from rural areas to cities is driven by the pursuit of better educational and job opportunities, as well as a higher standard of living. While there are potential drawbacks, I think the benefits of this trend, including economic growth and personal development, outweigh the disadvantages. Ultimately, this migration can lead to a more skilled, educated, and diverse population, which can have positive impacts on both urban and rural areas.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;I strongly agree with the statement that high school students should take a course on basic economics. In today's complex and increasingly globalized world, understanding the fundamentals of economics is essential for making informed decisions about personal finance, as well as grasping the broader societal implications of economic trends and policies.A course on basic economics would provide high school students with a foundational knowledge of key concepts such as supply and demand, the different types of market structures, the role of government in the economy, and basic personal finance principles like budgeting and saving. This knowledge would empower students to navigate the financial world with confidence, enabling them to make wise decisions about spending, saving, and investing their own money. Furthermore, it would foster a deeper understanding of current events and policy debates, making them more engaged and informed citizens.Moreover, learning about economics at a high school level could inspire students to pursue careers in fields related to economics, such as business, finance, or public policy. Early exposure to economic principles could also lead to a more financially literate population, capable of contributing to the economy in meaningful ways and avoiding pitfalls like debt and financial instability.Incorporating basic economics into high school curricula could also have a positive impact on societal economic outcomes. By teaching the next generation the value of money, the importance of saving, and the consequences of debt, we can work towards a future where individuals are better equipped to manage their financial lives and contribute to the overall economic health of their communities.In conclusion, teaching basic economics in high school is not only beneficial for the personal financial literacy of students but also for fostering a more economically conscious and responsible society. It equips the future generation with essential knowledge and skills, preparing them for independence and active participation in the economy. Therefore, I firmly believe that high school students should be required to take a course on basic economics.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that university education should be restricted to only the most academically gifted students has sparked intense debate. While some argue that this approach ensures the quality of higher education, I strongly disagree with this stance.Restricting university access to a select few would have far-reaching consequences, including limiting social mobility and exacerbating inequality. By only allowing top students to pursue higher education, the doors of opportunity would be closed to those from disadvantaged backgrounds who may not have had the same access to quality education and resources. This would perpetuate a cycle of disadvantage, where those who are already at a socio-economic disadvantage are further marginalized.Furthermore, university education is not solely about academic achievement. It provides a platform for personal growth, skill development, and networking opportunities that are essential for success in the modern workforce. By restricting access to university, we would be denying a large proportion of young people the chance to develop these valuable skills and qualities.Additionally, the diversity of the student body is a key aspect of university life, allowing students to engage with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. By only admitting the most academically gifted students, the university environment would become homogenous and lacking in diversity, leading to a narrow and limited learning experience.In conclusion, while it is understandable that there may be concerns about the quality of higher education, I firmly believe that university education should be available to a large proportion of young people, rather than being restricted to only the very best academic students. This approach would promote social mobility, diversity, and provide opportunities for personal growth and skill development, ultimately benefiting individuals and society as a whole.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;The notion that prevention is better than cure has gained significant traction in recent years, with many advocating for a shift in healthcare spending towards health education and preventative measures. I agree to a large extent with the statement that a substantial proportion of a country's health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.On the one hand, investing in health education and preventative measures can have long-term benefits, such as reducing the incidence of chronic diseases and promoting a healthier population. For instance, education campaigns on the importance of regular exercise, balanced diets, and stress management can empower individuals to take control of their health. Moreover, preventative measures like vaccinations, screenings, and regular check-ups can detect health issues early on, reducing the need for costly treatments.On the other hand, diverting funds from treatment to prevention may have unintended consequences, such as neglecting the needs of those already suffering from illnesses. A balance must be struck between prevention and treatment to ensure that those in need of medical attention receive it. Nevertheless, I believe that the benefits of preventative measures outweigh the potential drawbacks, and a significant proportion of the health budget should be allocated to health education and prevention.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that prevention is indeed better than cure. By allocating a substantial proportion of the health budget to health education and preventative measures, governments can promote a healthier population, reduce healthcare costs, and ultimately, improve the overall well-being of their citizens.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;The notion that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from school syllabuses to allow children to focus solely on academic subjects has gained significant attention in recent years. While the intention behind this proposal may be to enhance academic performance, I strongly disagree with this idea.Firstly, non-academic subjects play a vital role in the holistic development of students. Physical education, for instance, helps children maintain physical health, develop teamwork skills, and cultivate discipline. Similarly, cookery and other practical subjects foster creativity, independence, and essential life skills. By eliminating these subjects, students would be deprived of the opportunity to explore their interests and talents beyond academics.Moreover, an overemphasis on academic subjects can lead to student burnout and decreased motivation. Non-academic subjects provide a much-needed break from the rigors of academic learning, allowing students to recharge and refocus. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on their academic performance. Additionally, many non-academic subjects, such as physical education, have been shown to improve cognitive function and concentration, thereby benefiting academic achievement.Finally, it is essential to recognize that success in life is not solely dependent on academic achievement. The skills and knowledge acquired through non-academic subjects are invaluable in the real world, where teamwork, time management, and problem-solving abilities are highly prized. By removing these subjects, we risk producing students who are academically proficient but lack the practical skills and emotional intelligence necessary to thrive in their future careers and personal lives.In conclusion, while the pressure to succeed academically is undeniable, I firmly believe that non-academic subjects are essential to a well-rounded education. Rather than removing these subjects, schools should strive to strike a balance between academic and non-academic pursuits, allowing students to develop into capable, confident, and well-adjusted individuals.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals relocate to a foreign country, they are often faced with the decision of whether to adopt the customs of their new home or retain their own cultural traditions. This dilemma sparks a debate about the importance of cultural assimilation versus preserving one's heritage. In this essay, I will compare these two choices and argue that retaining one's own customs is the preferred option.On the one hand, following the customs of the new country can facilitate integration and social acceptance. By embracing local traditions, immigrants can demonstrate their commitment to their new community and avoid cultural clashes. However, this approach may lead to the loss of one's cultural identity and heritage. For instance, a person who completely adopts the new country's customs may struggle to pass on their native traditions to their children, potentially leading to a disconnection from their roots.On the other hand, retaining one's own customs allows individuals to maintain a strong sense of cultural identity and connection to their homeland. This approach enables them to share their unique perspectives and traditions with their new community, enriching the cultural diversity of their adopted country. For example, celebrating traditional festivals and holidays can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity in a foreign environment. Moreover, preserving one's customs can also facilitate a sense of community and belonging among fellow immigrants who share similar cultural backgrounds.In conclusion, while adopting the customs of a new country can have its advantages, I prefer retaining one's own customs. By doing so, individuals can preserve their cultural heritage, maintain a strong sense of identity, and contribute to the rich cultural tapestry of their adopted country. Ultimately, this approach allows immigrants to forge a sense of belonging while remaining true to their roots.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, the ability to work effectively with a group of people on a team is more important than working independently. While independence has its own merits, teamwork is crucial for achieving complex goals and solving problems that require diverse skill sets and perspectives.Working in a team allows individuals to pool their strengths, share ideas, and learn from one another's experiences. For instance, in a marketing project, a team comprising members with expertise in graphic design, writing, and social media can collaborate to create a comprehensive and engaging campaign. Each member brings their unique skills to the table, resulting in a more innovative and effective outcome than if they were working alone.Moreover, teamwork fosters creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability. When individuals work together, they can brainstorm solutions to challenges, as seen in Silicon Valley's tech companies, where cross-functional teams work together to develop cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, teamwork promotes accountability, motivation, and time management, as team members rely on each other to meet deadlines and achieve objectives.In contrast, working independently can lead to limited perspectives, skills, and resources. While some individuals may prefer to work alone, they may miss out on opportunities for growth, learning, and networking that teamwork provides. Furthermore, many real-world problems, such as climate change, poverty, and healthcare, require collaborative efforts from experts across various disciplines to develop effective solutions.In conclusion, the ability to work effectively with a group of people on a team is more important than working independently. By leveraging the strengths and expertise of team members, individuals can achieve more significant and sustainable outcomes, drive innovation, and address complex challenges that require collective effort and diverse perspectives.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Allowing smoking in restaurants poses significant health risks to both the patrons and the staff. Secondhand smoke, which is the smoke exhaled by smokers and the smoke emitted from burning tobacco products, contains over 70 known carcinogens and can cause lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health issues.For instance, a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at work are more likely to develop smoking-related illnesses than those who work in smoke-free environments. Furthermore, restaurants that allow smoking can be breeding grounds for respiratory problems, as the enclosed spaces can trap the smoke, making it even more hazardous to breathe.Moreover, prohibiting smoking in restaurants can also have economic benefits. Smoke-free laws can increase the number of customers who frequent restaurants, as many people prefer to dine in smoke-free environments. Additionally, many restaurants that have gone smoke-free have reported increased business and improved employee health.In conclusion, the prohibition of smoking in restaurants is essential for maintaining a healthy environment for patrons and staff alike. State laws that uphold this ban should be strictly enforced to prevent the dangers of secondhand smoke and promote a healthier community. By keeping restaurants smoke-free, we can reduce the risk of smoking-related illnesses, improve air quality, and create a more pleasant dining experience for everyone. Ultimately, upholding these laws is crucial for protecting public health and promoting a smoke-free society.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";I strongly agree that people should have hobbies and engage in physical activities that are very different from their work. Having a diverse range of interests and activities outside of one's profession can bring numerous benefits to an individual's physical and mental well-being. When people engage in activities that are vastly different from their work, they are able to break free from the mental and physical demands of their job, allowing them to recharge and refocus.Engaging in different hobbies and physical activities can also foster creativity, as it exposes individuals to new experiences, challenges, and ways of thinking. For instance, a software engineer who enjoys painting or a teacher who loves to play music can discover new sources of inspiration and innovation that can translate back to their work. Moreover, diverse activities can help build a range of skills, such as problem-solving, teamwork, and time management, which are valuable in both personal and professional life.Furthermore, pursuing different interests can provide a healthy balance between work and personal life, reducing the risk of burnout and improving overall job satisfaction. It allows individuals to establish an identity beyond their professional role, giving them a sense of fulfillment and purpose that is not solely dependent on their work performance. In addition, engaging in physical activities that are different from one's work can improve physical health, reduce stress, and enhance mood, contributing to a better quality of life.In conclusion, having hobbies and engaging in physical activities that are different from one's work is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance, fostering creativity, and ensuring overall well-being. It provides an outlet for relaxation, self-expression, and personal growth, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and balanced life. Therefore, it is highly beneficial for individuals to explore and maintain a variety of interests outside of their professional responsibilities.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The debate over whether governments should allocate more funds to improve roads and highways or to enhance public transportation has been ongoing. In my opinion, governments should prioritize spending more money on improving public transportation. This is because a well-developed public transportation system offers numerous benefits, including reduced traffic congestion, decreased air pollution, and increased economic productivity.Firstly, investing in public transportation can significantly alleviate traffic congestion on roads and highways. By providing efficient and reliable alternatives, such as buses, trains, and subways, commuters can opt for these modes of transport, thereby reducing the number of private vehicles on the road. This, in turn, can lead to a decrease in travel times, fuel consumption, and vehicle emissions. For instance, cities like Tokyo and New York have successfully implemented comprehensive public transportation systems, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.Secondly, a robust public transportation system can have a positive impact on the environment. Public transportation can accommodate a large number of passengers, reducing the need for personal vehicles and subsequently decreasing carbon emissions. Moreover, public transportation can be designed to be more energy-efficient, with many cities opting for electric or hybrid buses and trains. This can contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, helping to mitigate climate change.In conclusion, while improving roads and highways is essential, I firmly believe that governments should spend more money on enhancing public transportation. By doing so, they can create a more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation network, which can have numerous benefits for both the economy and the environment. Ultimately, a well-planned public transportation system can contribute to a better quality of life for citizens, making it a worthwhile investment for governments to pursue.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The debate about the most effective way to learn about life has sparked a longstanding discussion. On one hand, some people believe that listening to the advice of family and friends is the best approach, while others argue that personal experience is the key to learning about life. Both methods have their advantages, but after careful consideration, I believe that personal experience is the preferable way to learn about life.Listening to the advice of family and friends has its benefits. For instance, it allows individuals to gain valuable insights and avoid making mistakes that others have already made. Family and friends can offer guidance and support, providing a safety net for individuals to fall back on. Moreover, their advice is often based on their own experiences, which can be invaluable in navigating life's challenges.On the other hand, learning through personal experience has numerous advantages. It allows individuals to develop problem-solving skills, independence, and self-reliance. By facing challenges and making mistakes, individuals can learn and grow at an incredible pace. Personal experience also enables individuals to develop their own perspectives and opinions, rather than simply adopting those of others. Furthermore, it fosters resilience, adaptability, and creativity, essential qualities for success in life.In conclusion, while listening to the advice of family and friends has its merits, I firmly believe that personal experience is the preferable way to learn about life. It provides individuals with the opportunity to develop essential life skills, independence, and self-awareness. Although it may involve making mistakes and facing challenges, the lessons learned through personal experience are invaluable and can shape individuals into capable and confident individuals. Ultimately, personal experience is the best teacher, and it is through our own experiences that we truly learn and grow.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;"The statement ""Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" is a topic of debate among many. While some people believe that childhood is indeed the happiest time, others disagree. In my opinion, I agree with the statement to a certain extent.Childhood is a carefree and innocent time, where children are not burdened with the responsibilities and worries of the adult world. During this stage, children are able to explore, learn, and play without the pressure of making a living or providing for a family. They are also surrounded by loving family members and friends, who cater to their needs and provide them with a sense of security and comfort. Moreover, childhood is a time of wonder and discovery, where children experience new things and learn about the world around them with a sense of curiosity and awe.However, it is also important to note that childhood can be a challenging and difficult time for some individuals. Many children face difficulties such as poverty, abuse, and neglect, which can have a profound impact on their happiness and well-being. Additionally, some children may struggle with learning difficulties, social anxieties, or other issues that can make their childhood experiences less than ideal.In conclusion, while childhood can be a happy and idyllic time for many, it is not universally the happiest time of a person's life. Individual experiences and circumstances can vary greatly, and happiness is a subjective and personal experience. Nevertheless, for many people, childhood is a time of joy, and nostalgia for this carefree period is a common phenomenon. Ultimately, the happiness of childhood is dependent on a variety of factors, and it is up to each individual to create their own happy memories and experiences, regardless of their age."
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of modern technology and culinary innovations has indeed made food preparation easier and more convenient. This shift has significantly improved the way people live, offering numerous benefits that enhance overall well-being and lifestyle. One of the primary advantages is the saving of time. With the availability of pre-cut vegetables, microwaveable meals, and instant cooking appliances, individuals can prepare meals quickly, allowing for more time to focus on other aspects of life such as work, education, and leisure activities.Another significant improvement is the increased accessibility to a variety of cuisines and nutritional options. Ready-to-cook meal kits and delivery services provide people with the opportunity to explore different culinary traditions without the need for extensive cooking knowledge or time-consuming preparation. This diversity in diet can lead to a more balanced and healthy eating habit, contributing to better physical and mental health. For example, a busy professional can easily order a nutritious meal online, ensuring they consume a wholesome diet despite their tight schedule.Furthermore, the ease of food preparation has also contributed to social and economic benefits. It has enabled people to manage their food expenses more effectively, as they can buy ingredients or meals in portions that suit their needs, reducing food waste and saving money. Additionally, the convenience of modern food preparation methods has opened up new avenues for entrepreneurship and employment in the food delivery and preparation sector, boosting local economies.In conclusion, the ease with which food can be prepared nowadays has undoubtedly improved the way people live. It offers the dual benefits of saving time and providing access to a diverse range of healthy and exciting food options. As technology and food science continue to evolve, it is likely that the advantages of easy food preparation will expand, further enhancing the quality of life for individuals around the world.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The debate about whether young adults should seek independence from their parents as soon as possible or live with their families for a longer time has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I believe that living with families for a longer time is a more beneficial situation for young adults. On the one hand, living with parents can provide young adults with financial stability and security. For instance, many universities and colleges require students to have a permanent address, and living with parents can fulfill this requirement. Additionally, parents can offer emotional support and guidance to their children, helping them navigate the challenges of young adulthood. For example, a young adult who is pursuing higher education can benefit from the wisdom and experience of their parents in making important life decisions.On the other hand, seeking independence too early can lead to unnecessary stress and hardship. Many young adults who move out of their parents' homes too soon struggle with financial difficulties, such as paying rent and bills, and may have to sacrifice their education or career goals as a result. For example, a young adult who is working a part-time job to support themselves may not have the time or energy to pursue their passion or interests.In conclusion, while seeking independence is an important part of growing up, I believe that living with families for a longer time can provide young adults with the support and stability they need to succeed. By living with their parents, young adults can focus on their education and career goals without the burden of financial stress, and can also benefit from the love and guidance of their family. Ultimately, this can lead to a more successful and fulfilling life.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some people may view zoos as mere entertainment facilities, I believe they play a crucial role in conservation, education, and research. One of the primary purposes of a zoo is to provide a safe habitat for endangered species, which are often threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and hunting. For instance, the giant panda breeding program in zoos has helped increase the population of this iconic species, which was once on the brink of extinction.Zoos also serve as educational institutions, where visitors can learn about the importance of conservation and the impact of human activities on the environment. Many zoos offer interactive exhibits and programs that raise awareness about the plight of various species and the need to protect their habitats. For example, the San Diego Zoo's conservation program has educated millions of visitors about the importance of protecting polar bears and their habitats, which are threatened by climate change.Furthermore, zoos provide a platform for scientific research, which can inform conservation efforts and improve our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. By studying animals in controlled environments, zoos can help scientists develop effective conservation strategies and improve the management of wild populations. For instance, the study of animal behavior in zoos has helped researchers develop more effective reintroduction programs for species such as wolves and bears.In conclusion, I firmly believe that zoos have a useful purpose, including conservation, education, and research. By providing a safe haven for endangered species, educating visitors about conservation, and supporting scientific research, zoos make a significant contribution to the preservation of biodiversity and the protection of our planet's precious wildlife. Rather than having no useful purpose, zoos play a vital role in promoting the welfare of animals and the health of our planet.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The notion that parents are the best teachers for young children has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some argue that parents play a pivotal role in a child's educational journey, others contend that professional teachers are better equipped to provide a well-rounded education. In my opinion, I partially agree that parents are the best teachers for young children.On one hand, parents have a unique advantage in teaching their children due to the strong bond and trust that exists between them. Parents are able to provide individualized attention, which is particularly beneficial for young children who require guidance and support in their formative years. Moreover, parents are best positioned to instill values, morals, and cultural norms in their children, which are essential for their social and emotional development.On the other hand, parents may not possess the requisite skills or knowledge to teach certain subjects or concepts, particularly as children progress to higher levels of education. Professional teachers, on the other hand, have undergone rigorous training and have the necessary expertise to provide a comprehensive education. Additionally, teachers are better equipped to identify and address learning difficulties, and provide a structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to academic success.In conclusion, while parents play a vital role in the educational journey of young children, I believe that they are not the only or even the best teachers. A collaborative approach, where parents and professional teachers work together, is likely to yield the best outcomes for children. By providing a supportive and nurturing environment, and leveraging the strengths of both parents and teachers, we can ensure that young children receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for future success. Ultimately, it is the combination of parental love and professional teaching that is likely to produce the most effective learning outcomes.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The impact of television on young children has been a topic of concern for many years. While some argue that television has a negative influence on children, I agree that excessive exposure to television can have detrimental effects on their development.On the one hand, television can be a valuable source of education and entertainment for children. Many educational programs, such as Sesame Street and National Geographic, provide children with essential knowledge and skills. Additionally, television can also expose children to different cultures, traditions, and ways of life, broadening their understanding of the world.On the other hand, excessive exposure to television can lead to a range of negative consequences. For instance, watching violent or aggressive programs can lead to aggressive behavior in children. Furthermore, excessive television watching can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Moreover, television advertisements can also promote unhealthy foods and products, influencing children's eating habits and consumer behavior.In conclusion, while television can be a valuable resource for children, I believe that excessive exposure to it can have negative consequences. Parents and caregivers should monitor and control the amount of television children watch, and ensure that they are watching educational and informative programs. By doing so, we can minimize the negative influence of television and maximize its potential benefits for young children. Ultimately, a balanced and responsible approach to television watching is essential for promoting healthy development and well-being in children.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;I disagree with the notion that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. While job security is crucial, lifetime employment can have negative consequences for both the employer and the employee. One reason is that it can lead to complacency among employees. When employees know they have a job for life, they may not feel motivated to innovate, improve their skills, or work efficiently. For instance, Japan's lifetime employment system, which was once renowned for its employee loyalty and dedication, has recently been criticized for creating a culture of complacency among workers. Another reason is that lifetime employment can hinder a company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Businesses need to be agile and responsive to shifts in consumer demand, technological advancements, and economic fluctuations. With a lifetime employment policy, companies may be reluctant to lay off underperforming employees or restructure their workforce, even if it's necessary for the company's survival. For example, during the  of the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses had to quickly pivot their operations to stay afloat. Those with flexible workforces were better equipped to respond to the crisis than those with rigid, lifetime employment policies.Furthermore, lifetime employment can limit employees' career growth and development. When employees are tied to one company for their entire career, they may miss out on opportunities to gain new experiences, develop new skills, and advance in their field. This can lead to stagnation and dissatisfaction among employees, ultimately affecting their productivity and job satisfaction. In conclusion, while job security is essential, hiring employees for their entire lives is not a practical or beneficial approach for either employers or employees. Businesses should focus on creating a supportive and inclusive work environment that encourages employee growth, innovation, and job satisfaction, rather than guaranteeing lifetime employment.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. During childhood, individuals are carefree and innocent, which contributes to their overall happiness. Children are not burdened with the responsibilities and stresses of adulthood, such as financial worries, work pressures, and relationship problems. As a result, they are able to enjoy life's simple pleasures, like playing with friends, reading books, and exploring their surroundings, without the weight of adult concerns.For instance, think about a child's excitement on their birthday, or their joy when receiving a new toy. These moments are filled with pure happiness and anticipation, untainted by the complexities of adult life. Furthermore, children are constantly learning and discovering new things, which brings them a sense of wonder and excitement. Their imagination and creativity are also at their peak, allowing them to dream big and envision a world full of possibilities.In contrast, as people grow older, they often become jaded and cynical, losing the sense of wonder and excitement that defined their childhood. The pressures of adulthood can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety that can diminish happiness. Additionally, the loss of innocence and the realization of the world's harsh realities can also contribute to a decline in overall happiness. Therefore, based on these reasons and examples, I firmly believe that childhood is indeed the happiest time of a person's life, a time of unbridled joy, curiosity, and freedom from the complexities of adulthood.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";I strongly disagree with the notion that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Understanding our history is essential for navigating the complexities of the modern world. By studying the past, we can gain valuable insights into the causes and consequences of significant events, which can inform our decisions and actions in the present.For instance, the lessons learned from historical events such as World War II can serve as a warning against the dangers of nationalism, xenophobia, and totalitarianism. Moreover, the civil rights movement of the 1960s has inspired contemporary social justice movements, demonstrating the power of collective action and perseverance in the face of adversity. By learning from these experiences, we can develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of human nature, politics, and society.Furthermore, historical knowledge can also provide a foundation for innovation and progress. Many modern technologies and scientific discoveries have built upon the discoveries and inventions of the past. For example, the development of the internet was made possible by the earlier work on computer networks and telecommunications. By studying the past, we can appreciate the contributions of pioneers and build upon their achievements to drive further innovation.In conclusion, learning about the past is not a mere academic exercise, but a vital component of living in the present. It provides us with a rich context for understanding the world around us, informs our decisions, and inspires us to build a better future. By embracing our shared history, we can foster a more informed, empathetic, and progressive society. Therefore, I firmly believe that learning about the past has immense value for those of us living in the present.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The investment of governments in traveling to outer space has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that it is a waste of resources, I firmly believe that the investment is reasonable and justified. In my opinion, the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the costs.First and foremost, space exploration has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs and innovations that have improved our daily lives. For instance, the development of GPS technology, which was made possible through space research, has revolutionized the way we navigate and communicate. Moreover, the study of space has also led to significant advancements in fields such as medicine, telecommunications, and environmental science.Another reason why I think the investment is reasonable is that it has the potential to ensure the long-term survival of humanity. As we continue to face environmental challenges and resource depletion on Earth, space exploration offers a potential solution to these problems. By exploring and potentially colonizing other planets, we can ensure the continuation of our species and create new opportunities for resource extraction and economic growth.Additionally, the investment in space travel has also created new industries and job opportunities, which have a positive impact on the economy. The space industry is estimated to be worth billions of dollars and is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. This growth will not only create new job opportunities but also stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship.In conclusion, while the investment in traveling to outer space may seem expensive, I believe that it is a reasonable and necessary investment for the advancement of humanity. The benefits of space exploration, from scientific breakthroughs to economic growth, make it an investment worth making. As we continue to push the boundaries of space travel, we will undoubtedly uncover new opportunities and challenges that will shape the future of our planet and beyond.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";I partially agree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is true that excessive television watching can hinder face-to-face interaction, I believe that it is not the sole culprit behind the decline in communication.On one hand, television can be a significant obstacle to meaningful communication. When family members or friends gather in front of the TV, they often become engrossed in the program, watching in silence, and neglecting to engage with each other. This can lead to a lack of deep, personal conversations and a sense of disconnection. For instance, a family may spend their evening watching a movie together, but not utter a word to each other, missing out on opportunities to bond and share their thoughts and feelings.On the other hand, television can also be a tool that brings people together. Many people watch TV shows or sports events with their friends and family, and these shared experiences can create common topics of conversation and foster a sense of community. For example, watching a major sporting event or a popular TV show can provide a shared experience that sparks discussions and debates, leading to stronger relationships.In conclusion, while television can be a hindrance to communication, it is not the sole destroyer of communication among friends and family. It is up to individuals to strike a balance between watching TV and engaging in meaningful conversations with their loved ones. By being mindful of our TV watching habits and making an effort to engage with each other, we can ensure that television is a supplement to, rather than a substitute for, human interaction.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;I agree with the statement that letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. While it may be tempting to intervene and prevent a friend from making a mistake, doing so can often lead to resentment and damage to the relationship. Friends value their independence and autonomy, and being told what to do can be perceived as controlling or patronizing.For instance, if a friend is considering a questionable business investment, it may be tempting to try to talk them out of it. However, if they are determined to go through with it, attempting to stop them could lead to defensiveness and hurt feelings. Instead, letting them make their own decision, even if it turns out to be a mistake, allows them to learn and grow from the experience. This approach also shows that you respect their ability to make their own decisions and trust their judgment.Moreover, taking action to prevent a friend from making a mistake can also undermine their confidence and self-esteem. If a friend feels that you do not trust them to make good decisions, they may begin to doubt their own abilities, leading to a loss of confidence and independence. By letting friends make their own mistakes, we demonstrate that we believe in their capabilities and are willing to support them, even when they make errors. This approach ultimately strengthens the friendship and allows friends to learn and grow from their experiences. In conclusion, while it may be difficult to stand by and watch a friend make a mistake, it is often better than risking the destruction of the friendship by taking action to prevent it.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;One of the most significant ways parents can assist their teenage children in preparing for adult life is by encouraging them to take on a part-time job. This experience provides teenagers with invaluable skills, as well as a sense of responsibility and independence. By working part-time, teenagers can develop essential life skills such as time management, communication, and teamwork.Having a part-time job also teaches teenagers the importance of financial management. Earning their own money allows them to understand the value of hard work and make smart decisions about saving and spending. This experience is crucial in preparing them for the financial realities of adult life. Furthermore, part-time work exposes teenagers to various career paths and helps them discover their interests and strengths, which can inform their future educational and career choices.In addition to these practical benefits, a part-time job can also have a profound impact on a teenager's self-esteem and confidence. Achieving success in a work environment can be a powerful boost to their self-image, helping them develop a sense of capability and self-reliance. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.Moreover, encouraging teenagers to take on part-time work demonstrates trust and faith in their abilities, which is essential for their emotional and psychological development. It shows that parents believe in their capacity to handle responsibilities and make decisions, which fosters a sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take on a part-time job is one of the best ways parents can prepare them for adult life. It equips them with essential skills, financial literacy, and a sense of independence and self-worth. By supporting and guiding their teenagers in this endeavor, parents can set them up for success and help them navigate the challenges of adulthood with confidence and competence.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the city provides more opportunities and amenities, I firmly believe that growing up in the countryside is more beneficial for children. Firstly, the countryside offers a safer and healthier environment for children to grow and develop. The air and water are cleaner, and the pace of life is slower, which reduces the risk of accidents and stress-related problems. For instance, children growing up in the countryside are more likely to engage in outdoor activities, such as hiking and cycling, which promotes physical health and well-being. In contrast, city life is often associated with pollution, noise, and crowded streets, which can be overwhelming and detrimental to a child's health.Another significant advantage of growing up in the countryside is the stronger sense of community and social connections. In rural areas, neighbors often know and look out for each other, providing a supportive network for children to grow and develop. This is particularly important for children, as it teaches them valuable social skills, such as communication, empathy, and cooperation. Furthermore, the countryside provides more opportunities for children to engage with nature, which has been shown to have a positive impact on their mental health and cognitive development.In conclusion, while the city may offer more amenities and opportunities, I believe that growing up in the countryside is better for children. The safer and healthier environment, stronger sense of community, and opportunities to engage with nature make it an ideal place for children to grow and develop. As such, I strongly agree that the countryside is a more suitable place for children to grow up than a big city.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;I strongly agree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. From a young age, children look up to their parents as role models and learn valuable lessons from them. Parents have a unique opportunity to shape their child's personality, values, and beliefs, making them the most influential teachers in a child's life.One reason why parents are the best teachers is that they provide personalized guidance and support. Unlike school teachers, who have to cater to the needs of an entire class, parents can focus on their child's individual strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. For instance, if a child is struggling with a particular subject, their parent can provide one-on-one tutoring and help them overcome their difficulties. Additionally, parents can teach their children important life skills, such as cooking, cleaning, and time management, which are essential for independence and self-sufficiency.Another reason why parents are effective teachers is that they can provide real-life examples and practical experience. Children learn by observing and imitating their parents' behavior, and parents can use everyday situations to teach their children valuable lessons. For example, a parent can teach their child about the importance of honesty by being honest themselves, or about the value of hard work by working hard to provide for their family. Moreover, parents can pass on their cultural heritage, traditions, and values to their children, helping them develop a strong sense of identity and belonging.In conclusion, parents play a vital role in shaping their child's education and development. With their personalized guidance, real-life examples, and unconditional love, parents are indeed the best teachers. They have the unique ability to inspire, motivate, and guide their children, helping them grow into capable, confident, and compassionate individuals.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The advent of convenient food preparation methods has revolutionized the way people live. With the rise of ready-to-eat meals, microwaveable dishes, and meal delivery services, preparing food has become easier and faster than ever before. This change has undoubtedly improved the way people live, as it has saved them a significant amount of time and energy.One of the primary advantages of easy food preparation is the time it saves. In today's fast-paced world, people have increasingly busy schedules, leaving them with little time to devote to cooking. Convenient food options have made it possible for individuals to quickly prepare a meal, allowing them to allocate more time to other aspects of their lives, such as work, family, or leisure activities. For instance, a working professional can now easily heat up a pre-cooked meal in the microwave and have a nutritious dinner ready in a matter of minutes.Moreover, easy food preparation has also improved the lives of people with busy lifestyles by providing them with a wider range of dietary options. With the abundance of pre-prepared meals available, individuals can now easily access a variety of cuisines and dishes that they may not have had the time or skills to prepare themselves. This has not only enhanced their dining experiences but also exposed them to new flavors and culinary traditions. Additionally, meal delivery services have made it possible for people to enjoy their favorite foods from the comfort of their own homes, further enhancing their overall quality of life.In conclusion, the ease of food preparation has had a profoundly positive impact on the way people live. By saving time, providing a wider range of dietary options, and enhancing dining experiences, convenient food preparation methods have improved the overall quality of life for individuals with busy lifestyles. As the world continues to move at an increasingly rapid pace, the importance of easy food preparation will only continue to grow.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The debate about whether students should be required to take regular standardized tests has been ongoing for years. While some argue that these tests are unnecessary and create undue stress for students, others believe that they are a crucial tool for measuring academic progress. In this essay, I will argue that students should indeed be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning.First and foremost, standardized tests provide a fair and objective measure of a student's knowledge and understanding of a particular subject. These tests are designed to assess a student's mastery of specific skills and concepts, and the results can be used to identify areas where a student may need additional support or review. By taking regular standardized tests, students can demonstrate their proficiency in a subject and receive feedback on areas where they need to improve.Furthermore, standardized tests help to ensure that students are held to high academic standards. By requiring students to take these tests, the education system can ensure that all students are meeting the same benchmarks and are being held to the same expectations, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. This helps to promote equity and fairness in education, and ensures that all students have access to the same opportunities and resources.Additionally, standardized tests can help teachers and educators to identify areas where their instruction may be falling short. By analyzing the results of these tests, the education system can identify trends and patterns in student performance, and make data-driven decisions about how to improve instruction and support student learning. This can lead to more effective teaching methods and a better overall education for students. In conclusion, regular standardized tests are a valuable tool for measuring academic progress and ensuring that students are meeting high standards. They provide a fair and objective measure of student knowledge, promote equity and fairness in education, and help to identify areas for improvement in instruction. Therefore, students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";I strongly agree with the statement that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars. In today's knowledge-based economy, a university education is no longer a luxury, but a necessity for individuals to acquire the skills and knowledge required to compete in the job market. However, providing free university education can have numerous benefits for individuals and society as a whole.Firstly, making university education free would increase accessibility and equality of opportunity. Many talented and deserving students are often unable to pursue higher education due to financial constraints. By providing free university education, these students would have the opportunity to fulfill their potential and contribute to society in meaningful ways. Furthermore, this would help to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, promoting social mobility and reducing income inequality.Additionally, free university education can have long-term economic benefits. Educated individuals are more likely to be employed, earn higher salaries, and contribute to the tax base, thereby boosting economic growth. They are also more likely to be innovative, entrepreneurial, and creative, leading to the development of new ideas, products, and services that can drive economic progress.While some may argue that providing free university education is too costly and unsustainable, I believe that the long-term benefits outweigh the costs. Governments can explore alternative funding models, such as increasing corporate taxes or introducing a wealth tax, to fund free university education. In conclusion, providing free university education to all interested scholars is not only a moral imperative, but also an economic necessity. It can help to create a more equitable, innovative, and prosperous society, and I strongly believe that it is a policy worth pursuing.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of university professors has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they should focus on research, while others believe that educating students should be their primary responsibility. In my view, I think that university professors should strike a balance between research and teaching.On one hand, research is a crucial aspect of a professor's job, as it enables them to stay updated with the latest developments in their field and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Professors who are actively involved in research can bring new ideas and insights into the classroom, making their teaching more engaging and relevant. Moreover, research experience can also enhance their credibility and authority in the eyes of their students.On the other hand, educating students is the primary function of a university professor. Students enroll in universities to gain knowledge, skills, and guidance from experienced professors. Professors who are dedicated to teaching can provide individual attention, mentorship, and support to their students, which is essential for their academic and personal growth. Furthermore, good teaching is also essential for the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are highly valued by employers.In conclusion, I believe that university professors should allocate their time wisely to balance research and teaching. While research is essential for advancing knowledge and enhancing their credibility, teaching is crucial for the academic and personal growth of their students. By striking a balance between these two responsibilities, professors can become more effective educators and contribute to the development of the next generation of leaders and professionals. Ultimately, a balance between research and teaching will lead to better outcomes for both the professors and their students.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;"The influence of television and movies on people's behavior is a significant and multifaceted issue. These forms of media have the power to shape our attitudes, values, and behaviors, often in profound ways. One reason for this influence is the emotional connection we form with characters and storylines, which can inspire us to adopt new behaviors or attitudes. For example, movies like "" Erin Brockovich"" or ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" can motivate viewers to take action against social injustices or persevere through difficult circumstances.Another reason is the portrayal of certain lifestyles or behaviors as desirable or acceptable. Television shows and movies often feature characters who engage in risky or unhealthy behaviors, such as substance abuse or reckless driving, which can be emulated by viewers, particularly young and impressionable ones. Conversely, media can also promote positive behaviors, such as environmental sustainability or healthy eating habits, by showcasing characters who embody these values.Furthermore, television and movies can influence our purchasing decisions and consumer behaviors. Product placements and advertisements in movies and TV shows can create a desire for certain products or brands, leading to increased consumerism. For instance, the popularity of the ""Mission: Impossible"" movie franchise has been linked to an increase in sales of gadgets and clothing featured in the films.In conclusion, the influence of television and movies on people's behavior is a complex and far-reaching phenomenon. Through emotional connections, portrayals of desirable behaviors, and product placements, media can shape our attitudes, values, and behaviors in significant ways. As consumers of media, it is essential to be aware of these influences and critically evaluate the messages and values that are being conveyed. By doing so, we can harness the positive potential of media to inspire and educate, while minimizing its negative impacts."
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When traveling to new destinations, visiting museums is a common activity for many people. In my opinion, people visit museums for several compelling reasons. Firstly, museums provide a unique opportunity to learn about the history and culture of the place they are visiting. By exploring exhibits and artifacts, people can gain a deeper understanding of the local customs, traditions, and ways of life. For instance, the Louvre Museum in Paris offers insight into French art and history, while the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City showcases a vast collection of American and European art.Another reason people visit museums is to appreciate the artistic and architectural treasures on display. Museums often house iconic works of art, sculptures, and other masterpieces that are renowned worldwide. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, for example, is famous for its impressive collection of Renaissance art, including works by Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci. Visitors can marvel at the beauty and skill that went into creating these pieces, broadening their knowledge and appreciation of art.Lastly, museums offer a chance to experience the local community and engage with like-minded individuals. Many museums host guided tours, workshops, and interactive exhibits that foster discussion and learning among visitors. This social aspect of museum visits allows people to connect with others who share similar interests, creating a memorable and enjoyable experience. Overall, people visit museums to educate themselves about the local culture, admire artistic treasures, and engage with the community, making museums an essential part of any travel itinerary. By doing so, they can gain a more profound understanding and appreciation of the places they visit, and take home lasting memories of their travels.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"I disagree with the statement that in a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others. While it is true that the fast pace of modern life can lead to stress and impatience, I believe that politeness is more important than ever in such environments. Politeness is not just about being courteous, but also about showing respect and consideration for others. In a crowded and busy world, people are more likely to come into contact with strangers, and a simple act of politeness, such as saying ""excuse me"" or ""thank you"", can go a long way in making the interaction more pleasant and harmonious.Moreover, politeness can actually help to reduce stress and tension in busy and crowded situations. When people are polite to each other, it can create a sense of calm and civility, even in the midst of chaos. For example, a polite conversation with a stranger on a crowded train or bus can make the journey more enjoyable and help to distract from the discomfort of the crowded space. On the other hand, a lack of politeness can lead to conflict and aggression, which can escalate the stress and anxiety of being in a crowded and busy environment.In conclusion, I firmly believe that politeness is essential in a busy and crowded world. It is not a luxury that we can afford to discard, but rather a necessity that can help to make our interactions with others more pleasant and harmonious. By being polite to others, we can create a more positive and respectful atmosphere, even in the most crowded and chaotic of spaces. Therefore, we should continue to expect people to be polite to others, and strive to be polite ourselves, regardless of the circumstances."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;I strongly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Every challenging experience we encounter leaves an indelible mark on our personal and professional growth. These experiences,,assistant's knowledge cutoff: 2023,  teach us invaluable lessons that we can apply to similar situations in the future, thereby enhancing our decision-making skills and problem-solving abilities.For instance, failing in a job interview can be a disheartening experience, but it provides us with an opportunity to reassess our strengths and weaknesses, and to prepare more effectively for future interviews. Similarly, going through a difficult breakup can be an emotionally draining experience, but it teaches us the importance of self-love, self-respect, and the need to set boundaries in relationships. These lessons are invaluable and help us navigate through the complexities of life with greater ease and confidence.Moreover, many successful people have attributed their success to the difficult experiences they had to endure. For example, J.K. Rowling, the renowned author of the Harry Potter series, was a single mother living on welfare when she began writing her books. Her experiences of hardship and struggle inspired her to create a series that has become a cultural phenomenon, inspiring millions of readers worldwide. This exemplifies how difficult experiences can be transformed into valuable lessons that can propel us towards achieving our goals.In conclusion, the experiences that seem difficult at the time are indeed valuable lessons for the future. They equip us with the wisdom, resilience, and determination required to overcome obstacles and achieve success. By embracing these experiences and learning from them, we can transform our lives and create a brighter, more promising future for ourselves.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The debate about whether life in a city is better than life in the countryside has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the peaceful and serene atmosphere of the countryside, others argue that life in a city offers more opportunities and advantages. In my opinion, life in a city is indeed much better than life in the countryside.First and foremost, cities provide better job opportunities and higher salaries. Unlike rural areas, cities are hubs for businesses, industries, and corporations, offering a wide range of career options. Additionally, cities have well-developed infrastructure, including transportation systems, hospitals, and educational institutions, making it easier for people to access essential services. In contrast, rural areas often lack these basic amenities, making it difficult for people to lead a comfortable life.Another significant advantage of city life is the diversity and cultural richness it offers. Cities are melting pots of different cultures, ethnicities, and lifestyles, providing a unique and exciting experience for residents. People can enjoy a wide range of cuisines, festivals, and entertainment options, making city life vibrant and dynamic. Moreover, cities are centers of innovation and progress, with numerous museums, art galleries, and theaters, offering endless opportunities for personal growth and development.In conclusion, while life in the countryside has its own charm and advantages, life in a city is undoubtedly better. The opportunities, amenities, and cultural richness that cities offer make them ideal places to live, work, and thrive. With their fast-paced and dynamic environment, cities provide the perfect setting for people to pursue their dreams, achieve their goals, and lead a fulfilling life. Therefore, for those who value convenience, diversity, and opportunity, city life is the better choice.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;The relationship between job satisfaction, living environment, and overall happiness is a complex one. While some argue that the living environment plays a significant role in determining happiness, I firmly believe that one's job has a more profound impact on their happiness. First and foremost, a person's job is a significant part of their daily life, often occupying a substantial amount of their time and energy. A fulfilling and engaging job can bring a sense of purpose and satisfaction, which are essential components of happiness. On the other hand, a dull or stressful job can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction, ultimately affecting one's overall well-being. In contrast, while the living environment can certainly influence one's mood and quality of life, its impact may be less direct and consistent compared to the daily experience of a job. For instance, a person may live in a beautiful and comfortable house, but if they are miserable in their job, their overall happiness will still be compromised. Furthermore, a good job can provide the financial means to improve one's living environment, thereby creating a positive feedback loop that enhances happiness.Additionally, research has shown that people tend to adapt to their living environment over time, a phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation. This means that the initial happiness boost from moving to a new and exciting place often wears off, leaving individuals seeking other sources of fulfillment, such as their job. In conclusion, while both job and living environment are important factors that contribute to an individual's happiness, I believe that one's job has a more significant effect. A fulfilling job can provide a sense of purpose, financial security, and personal growth, all of which are crucial for achieving happiness. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize job satisfaction and engagement in pursuit of a happy and fulfilling life.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a plethora of options to suit different preferences and needs. While some individuals prefer the asynchronous methods of email and voice mail, others favor the immediacy of telephone or face-to-face interactions. As for me, I prefer face-to-face communication over other methods.Face-to-face communication allows for a depth of interaction that other methods cannot match. It enables the exchange of not just verbal information, but also non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions. These non-verbal signals are crucial for conveying emotions, as they provide context and help prevent misunderstandings that can easily arise from text-based or voice-only communication. Furthermore, face-to-face interactions facilitate immediate feedback and clarification, making conversations more efficient and personal.In contrast, while email and voice mail offer the convenience of asynchronous communication, allowing parties to respond at their leisure, they lack the immediacy and personal touch of face-to-face interactions. Telephone conversations, though immediate, still miss out on the non-verbal cues that are present in face-to-face communication, making them less personal and engaging compared to in-person discussions.Moreover, face-to-face communication fosters stronger, more meaningful relationships. The personal connection established through seeing and directly interacting with someone contributes significantly to building trust and understanding. In both personal and professional settings, the ability to read non-verbal cues and engage immediately with others can make a significant difference in the outcome of interactions, from sealing business deals to resolving conflicts.In conclusion, while different methods of communication have their advantages, face-to-face interaction stands out for its unique ability to combine verbal and non-verbal cues, immediacy, and personal connection. For those who value deep, meaningful, and efficient communication, face-to-face interaction is the preferred method.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";I partially disagree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is true that excessive television watching can lead to a decline in face-to-face interaction, it is not the sole cause of destroyed communication. In fact, television can also serve as a tool to facilitate conversation and bonding among loved ones.On one hand, it is undeniable that spending too much time watching television can lead to a decrease in meaningful interactions. When family members or friends gather in front of the TV, they often focus on the screen rather than engaging with each other. This can result in a lack of deep, substantial conversations and a sense of disconnection. For instance, a family that spends their evenings watching TV together may struggle to find topics to discuss during dinner or other social gatherings.On the other hand, television can also bring people together and provide a common topic of discussion. Many popular TV shows and events, such as sports games or award ceremonies, can serve as a shared experience that friends and family can talk about and bond over. For example, watching a favorite TV show together can lead to discussions about the plot, characters, and themes, fostering a sense of community and shared interest. Additionally, TV can also provide a way for people to relax and unwind together, promoting a sense of togetherness and comfort.In conclusion, while television can potentially hinder communication among friends and family if overused, it is not the primary cause of destroyed communication. When used in moderation, TV can actually facilitate social interaction and provide a shared experience that brings people closer together. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to strike a balance between TV watching and engaging in meaningful conversations with their loved ones.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a plethora of options to suit individual preferences. While some individuals prefer the convenience of e-mail or voice mail, others opt for the immediacy of telephone or face-to-face interactions. As for me, I firmly believe that face-to-face communication is the most effective and preferable method of interaction.Face-to-face communication allows for a deeper and more meaningful connection with the other person. Non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice convey emotions and intentions more accurately than any other form of communication. This enables a more nuanced understanding of the conversation, fostering empathy and building stronger relationships. Moreover,ely, face-to-face interactions promote active listening, ensuring that both parties are fully engaged and present in the conversation.In contrast, e-mail and voice mail can often lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings due to the lack of non-verbal cues. Telephone conversations, while allowing for real-time interaction, can still lack the visual cues that are essential for effective communication. Furthermore, face-to-face communication encourages spontaneity and flexibility, allowing for a more dynamic and responsive conversation.In conclusion, while technology has made it easier to communicate over long distances, face-to-face interaction remains the most effective and preferable method of communication. It allows for a deeper connection, nuanced understanding, and more engaging conversations. As such, I believe that face-to-face communication is essential for building strong relationships, conveying complex ideas, and fostering meaningful interactions. Ultimately, it is the most human and natural way to communicate, making it my preferred method of interaction.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The age-old adage ""haste makes waste"" suggests that acting too quickly or impulsively can lead to mistakes, inefficiencies, and ultimately, a wasteful use of resources. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as it is supported by numerous examples and reasons.One of the primary reasons haste makes waste is that it often leads to careless mistakes. When individuals rush through tasks or decisions, they are more likely to overlook crucial details or ignore potential pitfalls. For instance, a builder who hastens to complete a construction project may skimp on safety protocols, leading to accidents or structural flaws that can be costly to repair. Similarly, a student who rushes through an exam may misread questions or fail to fully answer them, resulting in poor grades.Another reason haste makes waste is that it can lead to inefficient use of resources. When people act hastily, they may not take the time to consider alternative solutions or optimize their approach. For example, a company that hastily launches a new product without conducting thorough market research may end up producing a item that does not meet customer needs, resulting in wasted materials, labor, and marketing expenses.Furthermore, history is replete with examples of how haste has led to disastrous consequences. The Titanic's sinking, the Challenger space shuttle disaster, and the financial crisis of 2008 are all testaments to the dangers of haste. In each of these cases, individuals or organizations acted too quickly, ignoring warning signs or neglecting to consider the potential risks and consequences of their actions.In conclusion, the statement ""haste makes waste"" is a timeless truth that highlights the importance of careful planning, consideration, and patience. By taking the time to think through decisions and actions, individuals and organizations can avoid mistakes, optimize resources, and achieve better outcomes. As the old adage wisely cautions, haste indeed makes waste, and it is essential to heed this warning to achieve success and efficiency."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The invention of the automobile has been a subject of debate among people, with some arguing that it has improved modern life, while others believe it has caused serious problems. In my opinion, the automobile has had a profound impact on modern life, both positively and negatively.On the positive side, the automobile has greatly increased mobility and connectivity, allowing people to travel long distances quickly and easily. This has opened up new opportunities for employment, education, and leisure activities, greatly improving the quality of life for many individuals. For example, the automobile has enabled people to live in suburban areas and commute to cities for work, thereby reducing the pressure on urban housing and improving the overall standard of living.However, the automobile has also caused serious problems, particularly with regards to the environment and traffic congestion. The emissions from vehicles have contributed significantly to air pollution, which has severe health implications, including respiratory problems and other diseases. Furthermore, the increased number of vehicles on the road has led to traffic congestion, which not only wastes time but also increases the risk of accidents. For instance, cities like Tokyo and New York are notorious for their traffic jams, which have become a major headache for commuters.In conclusion, while the automobile has undoubtedly improved modern life by increasing mobility and connectivity, it has also caused serious problems, including environmental pollution and traffic congestion. To mitigate these problems, governments and individuals must work together to promote sustainable transportation practices, such as using public transport, cycling, or walking, and investing in cleaner energy technologies. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of the automobile are balanced with the need to protect the environment and public health.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The statement that it is better for children to choose jobs similar to their parents' jobs is a topic of debate. While some argue that following in their parents' footsteps can provide a sense of stability and familiarity, I disagree with this statement. Choosing a job that is very different from their parents' can be more beneficial for children in the long run.On one hand, choosing a job similar to their parents' can provide children with a clear understanding of the profession and its demands. They may also have access to valuable advice and guidance from their parents, which can be extremely helpful in navigating the industry. Additionally, this can also foster a sense of tradition and continuity within the family.On the other hand, I believe that choosing a job that is different from their parents' can be more advantageous for children. This allows them to explore their own interests and passions, and to develop a sense of independence and self-reliance. By venturing into a new field, children can discover new strengths and talents that they may not have known they possessed. Moreover, this can also lead to a more diverse and dynamic workforce, as people from different backgrounds and perspectives come together to share their unique skills and experiences.Furthermore, with the ever-changing job market and technological advancements, it is essential for children to be adaptable and open to new opportunities. By choosing a job that is different from their parents', children can stay ahead of the curve and be better equipped to handle the challenges of the modern workforce. In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to choosing a job similar to their parents', I firmly believe that choosing a job that is different can lead to a more fulfilling and successful career.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;The debate about whether parents should limit the time children spend watching TV and movies to improve their academic performance has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I strongly agree that limiting screen time is essential for children to excel in school.Excessive TV and movie watching can have detrimental effects on a child's academic performance. When children spend too much time in front of the screen, they are likely to neglect their homework and reading assignments, which are crucial for their intellectual development. Furthermore, the passive nature of watching TV and movies does not stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic success. In contrast, engaging in physical activities, reading, and participating in extracurricular activities can help children develop these skills and improve their overall academic performance.Moreover, limiting screen time can also help children develop good study habits and a strong work ethic. When children are not distracted by TV and movies, they are more likely to focus on their studies and develop a sense of discipline and responsibility. This, in turn, can help them achieve better grades and develop a positive attitude towards learning. Additionally, limiting screen time can also help children avoid the negative influences of violent or inappropriate content that may be depicted on TV and in movies, which can have a negative impact on their behavior and well-being.In conclusion, I firmly believe that limiting the time children spend watching TV and movies is essential for their academic success. By doing so, parents can help their children develop good study habits, critical thinking skills, and a strong work ethic, all of which are crucial for achieving academic excellence. Therefore, parents should take an active role in monitoring and limiting their child's screen time to ensure they have the best possible chance of succeeding in school.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The debate over whether professional athletes, often referred to as entertainers, deserve their high salaries has been ongoing for years. On one hand, it can be argued that these individuals bring in massive revenues for their teams, leagues, and sponsors through ticket sales, merchandise, and advertising. Their performances are watched by millions worldwide, generating substantial income from broadcasting rights alone. The market dictates their salaries, with top athletes able to command high figures due to their unique talents and the significant financial impact they have on their respective sports.On the other hand, critics argue that the salaries of professional athletes are excessively high, especially when compared to those of teachers, healthcare workers, and other essential professions that contribute significantly to society's well-being. It's hard to justify why entertainers should earn tens of millions of dollars annually while critical public servants and workers struggle to make ends meet. Furthermore, the high salaries can create an imbalance, where the focus shifts from the sport itself to the financial aspect, potentially corrupting the essence of competition and fair play.However, it's also important to consider that professional athletes have a very short career span, usually lasting less than a decade at the top level. Their window for earning is limited, and they must capitalize on their market value during this time. Additionally, the training, dedication, and risk of injury they undertake to perform at such high levels are significant, often requiring a lifetime of preparation and sacrifice.In conclusion, while the high salaries of professional athletes may seem unjustified at first glance, especially in comparison to other professions, they are a product of market demand and the immense revenue they generate. It's a complex issue, influenced by factors such as career longevity, personal risk, and societal value placed on entertainment. Perhaps, rather than questioning their salaries, we should focus on creating a more balanced compensation system across different professions, reflecting the true value each brings to society.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";I strongly agree with the statement that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. In a collaborative environment, receiving and giving feedback is a crucial aspect of achieving common goals. When individuals are unable to accept criticism, they create a barrier to effective communication and hinder the team's progress.Accepting criticism is essential in group work as it allows team members to identify and address mistakes,,assistant,I strongly agree with the statement that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. In a collaborative environment, receiving and giving feedback is a crucial aspect of achieving common goals. When individuals are unable to accept criticism, they create a barrier to effective communication and hinder the team's progress.Accepting criticism is essential in group work as it allows team members to identify and address mistakes, correct misconceptions, and improve overall performance. Those who cannot accept criticism often become defensive, dismissive, or even hostile, leading to conflict and undermining the team's morale. This behavior not only hampers their own growth but also prevents the team from benefiting from diverse perspectives and ideas.Furthermore, the inability to accept criticism can lead to a lack of accountability and a reluctance to take risks. When individuals are not open to feedback, they may be less likely to experiment with new approaches or suggest innovative solutions, fearing that their ideas will be rejected or criticized. This can result in stagnation and a lack of progress towards the team's objectives.In contrast, individuals who can accept and learn from criticism demonstrate a growth mindset, flexibility, and a commitment to collective success. They are more likely to engage in constructive discussions, build strong relationships with their team members, and contribute to a positive and productive team culture. Ultimately, the ability to accept criticism is a vital skill for effective collaboration and a key determinant of success in group working.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;The education of young children, aged 5-10, is a multifaceted and crucial aspect of their development. While math, science, history, and language are foundational subjects, the question arises as to whether music and art should be mandatory additions to their curriculum. In my opinion, incorporating music and art into the educational framework of young children is not only beneficial but essential.Music and art provide a unique set of skills and ways of thinking that complement the traditional academic subjects. They foster creativity, self-expression, and imagination, allowing children to explore and understand the world around them in diverse and innovative ways. Moreover, research has shown that engaging in music and art activities can enhance cognitive skills, including memory, spatial-temporal skills, and language development, thereby supporting the learning of traditional subjects.Furthermore, music and art education can have a profound impact on the emotional and social development of children. They offer platforms for children to express their feelings, develop empathy through understanding different forms of artistic expression, and build confidence through performances and exhibitions. Additionally, collaborative art and music projects encourage teamwork, communication, and mutual respect among peers, which are vital life skills.Implementing music and art as compulsory subjects also addresses the issue of accessibility and equality in education. Every child, regardless of their socio-economic background, should have the opportunity to discover their artistic and musical talents. This can potentially uncover hidden talents and provide a more holistic approach to education, where every aspect of a child's intelligence and creativity is nurtured.In conclusion, requiring young children to learn music and art alongside traditional subjects is a forward-thinking approach to education. It ensures a balanced development of cognitive, emotional, and social skills, preparing them for a future where creativity, innovation, and self-expression are increasingly valued. By embracing music and art, we not only enrich the educational experience but also contribute to the shaping of well-rounded, imaginative, and socially adept individuals.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;I strongly agree with the statement that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is by explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school. When students are able to see the relevance and practical application of a subject, they are more likely to become engaged and motivated to learn. This approach not only helps students understand the value of the subject but also makes the learning process more meaningful and enjoyable.Many students often wonder why they need to learn certain subjects, especially those that may seem abstract or unrelated to their everyday lives. By connecting the subject matter to real-life scenarios, teachers can help students appreciate the significance of what they are learning. For instance, a math teacher can explain how mathematical concepts are used in finance, science, or engineering, making the subject more appealing and relevant to students who may be interested in pursuing careers in these fields.Moreover, explaining the practical applications of a subject can also help students develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking. When students can see how a subject is used in real-life contexts, they are more likely to be interested in exploring and applying the concepts they learn. This, in turn, can lead to a deeper understanding and retention of the subject matter. Overall, making the connection between the subject and real-life applications is a powerful way for teachers to spark students' interest and motivation, making learning a more enjoyable and rewarding experience. By doing so, teachers can inspire students to take a more active role in their learning, leading to a more successful and fulfilling educational experience.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, pollution, and conservation, the allocation of government budgets has become a critical issue. While economic development is crucial for a country's growth and prosperity, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize environmental protection over economic development. The rationale behind this argument is multifaceted.Firstly, environmental degradation has severe and long-lasting consequences on human health, biodiversity, and the economy itself. The costs of pollution, climate change, and loss of ecosystem services far outweigh the short-term benefits of economic growth. For instance, air pollution alone is responsible for millions of premature deaths worldwide, resulting in significant economic burdens on healthcare systems. By investing in environmental protection, governments can prevent these costs and ensure a healthier and more productive population.Secondly, environmental protection can actually drive economic growth and create new opportunities. Investments in renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and eco-tourism can generate jobs, stimulate innovation, and attract foreign investment. Moreover, a clean and healthy environment is a key factor in attracting businesses, talents, and tourists, which can contribute to a country's economic development.Finally, the window for taking action to protect the environment is rapidly closing. Climate change, in particular, requires immediate and collective action to mitigate its worst impacts. By prioritizing environmental protection, governments can demonstrate their commitment to the well-being of their citizens, the planet, and future generations. In conclusion, while economic development is important, governments should allocate a larger share of their budgets to environmental protection. This will not only ensure a sustainable future but also drive economic growth, improve public health, and enhance the overall quality of life. Ultimately, the fate of our planet depends on the choices we make today, and governments have a critical role to play in protecting the environment for tomorrow.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;I agree with the statement that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This prediction is based on several factors, including the growing concern for the environment, the advancement of alternative modes of transportation, and the increasing cost of car ownership.Firstly, the world is shifting towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly lifestyle. With the rising awareness of climate change and air pollution, many countries are implementing policies to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. For instance, cities like London and Singapore have already introduced congestion charges to discourage driving in urban areas. Furthermore, the development of electric and hybrid vehicles, although a step in the right direction, may not be enough to offset the sheer number of cars currently in use.Secondly, alternative modes of transportation are becoming increasingly accessible and efficient. Public transportation systems, such as high-speed trains and buses, are being expanded and improved, making them a more viable option for commuters. Additionally, the rise of bike-sharing programs and pedestrian-friendly cities is also expected to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles.Lastly, the cost of car ownership is becoming prohibitively expensive for many individuals. With the increasing cost of fuel, insurance, and maintenance, many people are opting for car-sharing services or ride-hailing apps instead of owning a car. This shift towards a shared economy is expected to continue, leading to a decrease in the number of cars on the road.In conclusion, based on the growing environmental concerns, advancements in alternative transportation, and the increasing cost of car ownership, I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. As the world continues to urbanize and prioritize sustainability, the need for personal vehicles will likely decrease, paving the way for a more efficient and environmentally-friendly transportation system.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;"The notion that university students do not need to attend classes as long as they can pass their examinations has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that attending classes is not a prerequisite for academic success, I strongly disagree with this statement. Attending classes is a crucial aspect of the university experience, and it offers numerous benefits that go beyond just passing examinations. Firstly, classes provide students with the opportunity to engage with their professors and peers, facilitating discussions, debates, and the exchange of ideas. This interactive learning environment helps students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for their future careers. Moreover, classes allow students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and receive immediate feedback, which is often not possible through self-study.Furthermore, attending classes helps students to stay motivated and focused. When students attend classes regularly, they are more likely to keep up with the coursework, complete assignments on time, and prepare for exams. This, in turn, reduces stress and anxiety, leading to better academic performance. Additionally, classes provide students with access to resources, such as libraries, laboratories, and other facilities, which are essential for their academic success.While it is true that some students may be able to pass their examinations without attending classes, this approach can lead to a narrow and superficial understanding of the subject matter. University education is not just about passing exams; it is about developing a deep understanding of the subject, cultivating skills, and fostering personal growth. By attending classes, students can gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the material, which will serve them well in their future endeavors. In conclusion, attending classes is an essential part of the university experience, and it is necessary for students to attend classes to get the most out of their education."
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The quotation ""When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success"" is a statement that sparks debate. While hard work is undoubtedly a crucial factor in achieving success, I disagree with the notion that luck has no role to play. On one hand, hard work is essential for success. Dedication, perseverance, and a strong work ethic are all key elements that contribute to achieving goals. Many successful individuals, such as entrepreneurs, athletes, and artists, can attest to the fact that their success is a result of tireless effort and unwavering commitment. For instance, Thomas Edison's famous quote ""Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration"" highlights the importance of hard work in achieving success.On the other hand, luck also plays a significant role in success. Being in the right place at the right time, meeting the right people, and having access to opportunities can all be attributed to luck. Many successful people have had fortunate circumstances that have contributed to their success, such as inheriting a business, being born into a wealthy family, or having a natural talent. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, has spoken about how luck played a role in her success, as her book was accepted by a publisher after being rejected by many others.In conclusion, while hard work is a vital component of success, it is unrealistic to dismiss the role of luck entirely. Both hard work and luck are intertwined, and it is often a combination of the two that leads to success. Therefore, I disagree with the quotation, as luck can indeed have a significant impact on achieving success."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The debate over whether self-study or teacher-guided learning is more effective has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals believe that they can learn better on their own, I firmly believe that having a teacher is more beneficial. There are several reasons that support this preference.Firstly, a teacher provides personalized guidance and feedback, which is crucial for correcting mistakes and improving understanding. When learning by oneself, it is easy to miss important details or misunderstand complex concepts, leading to misconceptions and poor retention. In contrast, a teacher can identify areas where a student needs extra support and provide tailored guidance to address these weaknesses.Secondly, a teacher creates a structured and organized learning environment, which helps students stay motivated and focused. Self-study often requires a high level of discipline and self-motivation, which can be difficult to maintain, especially when faced with challenging or boring material. A teacher, on the other hand, can break down complex topics into manageable chunks, making it easier for students to stay engaged and track their progress.Lastly, a teacher provides valuable opportunities for interaction and discussion, which are essential for deeper understanding and retention of material. Class discussions and debates allow students to share perspectives, ask questions, and learn from one another, fostering a richer and more comprehensive learning experience. In contrast, self-study can be a solitary and isolating experience, lacking the social interaction and intellectual stimulation that a teacher provides.In conclusion, while self-study has its advantages, I firmly believe that having a teacher is more beneficial for effective learning. The personalized guidance, structured learning environment, and opportunities for interaction and discussion that a teacher provides make for a more engaging, motivating, and ultimately, more successful learning experience.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The statement that working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a company's office using the same equipment has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that working from home offers greater flexibility and comfort, I partially disagree with this statement. On the one hand, working from home can be beneficial in many ways. For instance, it eliminates the need for daily commuting, which can be time-consuming and exhausting. Moreover, it provides employees with a comfortable and familiar environment, allowing them to manage their workload more efficiently. With the advancement of technology, remote work has become easier, and employees can stay connected with their colleagues and managers through various digital platforms.On the other hand, working in a company's office has its own advantages. Face-to-face interactions with colleagues can foster teamwork, creativity, and innovation. Office environments also provide access to resources and equipment that may not be available at home. Additionally, separating work and personal life is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance, which can be challenging when working from home.In conclusion, while working from home offers flexibility and comfort, it is not necessarily better than working in a company's office. Both options have their pros and cons, and the best choice depends on individual preferences, job requirements, and company culture. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the benefits of both remote and office work might be the most effective way to boost productivity and employee satisfaction.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;"The statement ""In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else"" is a notion that has sparked debate among individuals. While some may argue that conforming to societal norms is essential for success, I strongly disagree with this statement. Embracing individuality and uniqueness is crucial for achieving success in various aspects of life.Being different from others allows individuals to stand out and showcase their unique talents, skills, and perspectives. In a world where everyone is alike, innovation and progress would be hindered. History has shown us that pioneers and trailblazers who dared to be different have made significant contributions to their respective fields. For instance, Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, revolutionized the tech industry with his unconventional approach to design and innovation.Moreover, being true to oneself and embracing one's differences fosters authenticity and creativity. When individuals are not constrained by societal expectations, they are more likely to take risks, challenge the status quo, and push boundaries. This, in turn, leads to personal growth, self-discovery, and a deeper understanding of one's passions and strengths.In contrast, trying to be like others can lead to mediocrity and a lack of fulfillment. When individuals conform to societal norms, they may compromise their values, interests, and aspirations. This can result in a sense of disauthenticity and discontentment, ultimately hindering their chances of success.In conclusion, I firmly believe that being different from others is a vital aspect of achieving success. By embracing our unique qualities, talents, and perspectives, we can make meaningful contributions, innovate, and grow as individuals. Rather than trying to fit in, we should strive to stand out and make our mark on the world."
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;I strongly agree with the statement that younger school children, aged five to ten, should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science, and history. While the core subjects are essential for a child's academic development, art and music play a vital role in fostering creativity, self-expression, and emotional intelligence.Studying art and music can have a profound impact on a child's cognitive and social development. Research has shown that children who participate in art and music programs tend to perform better academically, have improved memory and spatial skills, and exhibit increased confidence and self-esteem. Moreover, art and music education can help children develop essential life skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.Furthermore, incorporating art and music into the curriculum can make learning more engaging and enjoyable for young children. It can provide a much-needed break from the rigors of academic learning and offer a platform for children to express themselves and showcase their talents. Additionally, art and music can be used to teach other subjects in a more interactive and fun way, making learning a more holistic and immersive experience.In conclusion, requiring younger school children to study art and music is essential for their overall development and well-being. It can help them become more creative, confident, and well-rounded individuals, equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in an increasingly complex and competitive world. By incorporating art and music into the curriculum, we can provide children with a more comprehensive education that prepares them for a lifetime of learning, growth, and exploration.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;I disagree with the statement that the personal and work-related challenges faced by young people today are not different from those faced by their parents and grandparents when they were young. While it is true that some challenges, such as financial stress and relationship issues, are timeless and universal, I believe that the nature and complexity of challenges have evolved significantly over time.In today's fast-paced and technology-driven world, young people are confronted with a unique set of challenges that their parents and grandparents did not face. For instance, the rise of social media has created new pressures and expectations around body image, self-presentation, and online etiquette. Additionally, the changing nature of work, with the gig economy and automation, has introduced new uncertainties and insecurities about career stability and financial security.Furthermore, the pace of technological change has accelerated, and young people are expected to be constantly adaptable and skilled in new areas, such as data analysis and digital literacy. This has created a new kind of stress and anxiety that is distinct from the challenges faced by previous generations. Moreover, issues like climate change, mental health, and diversity and inclusion have become more prominent and pressing, requiring young people to navigate complex social and environmental issues that their parents and grandparents may not have encountered.In conclusion, while some challenges may be similar across generations, I believe that the personal and work-related challenges faced by young people today are distinct and require new skills, attitudes, and resilience. It is essential to acknowledge and address these unique challenges to support the well-being and success of young people in today's rapidly changing world.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. In today's interconnected world, having a broad range of knowledge is essential for success. By studying multiple subjects, individuals can develop a deeper understanding of the world and its complexities. For instance, a student who studies both science and history can better comprehend the impact of scientific discoveries on societal development.Moreover, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects fosters critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. When individuals are familiar with various subjects, they can approach problems from different angles, making them more innovative and adaptable. For example, a person who has studied both mathematics and philosophy can apply logical reasoning to real-world problems, leading to more effective solutions.Additionally, the job market is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, and employers are looking for individuals who can think across boundaries. By having a broad knowledge base, individuals can pursue a wider range of career opportunities and be more competitive in the job market. For instance, a graduate with a broad knowledge of economics, politics, and sociology can work in fields such as policy analysis, international development, or social entrepreneurship.In conclusion, while specializing in one subject can provide in-depth knowledge, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial in today's fast-paced and interconnected world. It allows individuals to think critically, approach problems creatively, and pursue a wider range of career opportunities. Therefore, I firmly believe that having a broad knowledge base is essential for success and should be prioritized over specialization in one specific subject.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"I strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, it is essential to be adaptable and willing to step out of one's comfort zone to achieve success. Trying new things and taking calculated risks allows individuals to learn, to innovate, and to grow both personally and professionally.One of the primary reasons successful people try new things is that it fosters creativity and innovation. For instance, Steve Jobs,'the co-founder of Apple, was known for his willingness to take risks and try new approaches to technology and design. His innovative ideas led to the creation of groundbreaking products such as the iPhone and iPad, which revolutionized the tech industry. Similarly, entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and Richard Branson have built their empires by continuously pushing boundaries and exploring uncharted territories in their respective fields.Moreover, taking risks and trying new things helps build resilience and develops problem-solving skills. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His perseverance and willingness to try new approaches ultimately led to his success. This mindset is crucial in overcoming obstacles and achieving long-term goals.In conclusion, trying new things and taking risks is a hallmark of successful people. It allows them to innovate, to learn from their failures, and to grow in ways that would not be possible if they only stuck to what they already know. By embracing this mindset, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve greater heights of success."
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;I agree with the statement that for success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. While academic achievement is crucial, it is not the only factor that determines one's success in the workplace. The ability to communicate effectively, build relationships, and work collaboratively with others is essential in most professions.In today's fast-paced and interconnected business environment, being able to relate well to people is vital for career advancement. Employers value employees who can work well in teams, as they are more likely to contribute to a positive and productive work atmosphere. For instance, a salesperson who can build rapport with clients and understand their needs is more likely to make sales and drive business growth. Similarly, a manager who can motivate and empower their team members can lead to increased job satisfaction and higher productivity.Moreover, many jobs require problem-solving and conflict resolution, which involve working with people to find solutions. A person who can effectively communicate and negotiate with others is more likely to resolve issues and achieve their goals. In contrast, a person who excels academically but struggles to relate to others may find it challenging to work effectively in a team or build a strong professional network.In conclusion, while studying hard in school is important, the ability to relate well to people is a critical factor in achieving success in a future job. Employers value interpersonal skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, as these skills enable employees to work effectively with others and drive business results. Therefore, it is essential for students to develop their people skills alongside their academic knowledge to succeed in their future careers.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;"The statement that advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits is a topic of debate. While advertising does play a significant role in shaping our eating habits, I partially agree with this statement. On one hand, advertising can be a major contributor to unhealthy eating habits. Advertisements for junk food, such as sugary snacks, fast food, and processed meals, often target children and young adults, who are more susceptible to persuasive marketing tactics. These advertisements create a desire for unhealthy foods, which can lead to overconsumption and ultimately, unhealthy eating habits.Moreover, food advertisers often use misleading labeling and deceptive marketing strategies to make their products appear healthier than they actually are. This can lead consumers to make poor food choices, thinking they are selecting a healthier option. For instance, a sugary cereal may be labeled as ""whole grain"" or ""all-natural"" to make it seem like a nutritious choice. However, the reality is that these foods are often high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that individual choices and other factors, such as socioeconomic status, education, and cultural background, also contribute to unhealthy eating habits. People from low-income backgrounds may rely on fast food and processed meals due to their affordability and convenience. Additionally, lack of nutrition education and cooking skills can also lead to poor food choices. Therefore, while advertising is a significant factor in promoting unhealthy eating habits, it is not the sole cause. A comprehensive approach that addresses multiple factors, including education, socioeconomic status, and individual choices, is necessary to promote healthy eating habits. In conclusion, advertising is a significant contributor to unhealthy eating habits, but it is not the only cause, and a multifaceted approach is required to tackle this issue."
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";I disagree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is true that excessive television watching can lead to a decline in face-to-face interaction, it is not the sole culprit behind the erosion of communication among loved ones.In fact, television can also serve as a tool to facilitate communication and bonding among friends and family. For instance, many families gather around the TV to watch their favorite shows or sports events together, which can spark conversations and create shared experiences. Moreover, TV programs can provide topics for discussion, allowing individuals to engage with each other and exchange opinions.Additionally, television can also bring people together through live events and specials, such as awards shows or holiday programming. These events can create a sense of community and togetherness, as people come together to watch and discuss the same programs. Furthermore, with the rise of streaming services, people can now watch their favorite shows together remotely, allowing for virtual watch parties and discussions.It is also worth noting that communication among friends and family is a complex issue that cannot be blamed on a single factor such as television. Other factors such as busy schedules, social media, and geographical distance can also contribute to a decline in communication. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to make an effort to maintain communication and connection with their loved ones, regardless of their TV watching habits. By finding a balance between TV watching and other activities, and using TV as a tool to facilitate communication, friends and family can maintain and even strengthen their relationships.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries at universities and colleges, and should receive equal financial support, is a topic of debate among educators and administrators. In my opinion, I agree with this statement to a certain extent.On one hand, classes and libraries are the core components of academic institutions, providing students with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in their chosen fields. They are essential for academic growth and development, and therefore, deserve a significant portion of the budget. However, sports and social activities play a vital role in promoting physical and mental well-being, teamwork, and social skills among students. They provide a much-needed break from the academic rigors, allowing students to recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance.Moreover, sports and social activities can have a positive impact on students' academic performance. Research has shown that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have higher GPAs, better attendance, and higher graduation rates compared to those who do not. Furthermore, sports and social activities can foster a sense of community and school spirit, which can lead to increased student engagement, retention, and overall satisfaction.While I do not advocate for equal financial support, I believe that sports and social activities should receive a fair share of the budget. A balanced allocation of resources, one that prioritizes academic programs while also supporting sports and social activities, can create a well-rounded and supportive learning environment. By providing opportunities for students to develop holistically, universities and colleges can produce graduates who are not only academically prepared but also physically, emotionally, and socially equipped to succeed in their future endeavors.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;The statement posits that for success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. I agree with this statement. While academic knowledge is undoubtedly crucial, the ability to interact and communicate effectively with others is essential for professional success.In most professions, teamwork and collaboration are vital components. Employers often look for individuals who can work harmoniously with colleagues, communicate effectively with clients, and build strong relationships with stakeholders. A person with excellent people skills can facilitate a positive and productive work environment, which is critical for achieving organizational goals. Moreover, strong interpersonal skills enable employees to navigate conflicts, provide excellent customer service, and negotiate effectively, all of which are invaluable assets to any organization.On the other hand, while studying hard in school is important for acquiring knowledge and skills, it is not the sole determinant of future job success. Many individuals who excel academically may struggle to apply their knowledge in real-world settings or fail to work effectively with others. In contrast, a person with strong people skills can often learn and adapt quickly, even if they lack some academic background. They can also leverage their network and relationships to access new opportunities and stay ahead in their field.In conclusion, while academic achievement is important, the ability to relate well to people is a more critical factor for success in a future job. As the modern workplace increasingly values collaboration, communication, and teamwork, employers prioritize candidates who can work effectively with others. Therefore, developing strong interpersonal skills should be a key focus for students alongside academic pursuits.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability.

270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The debate about whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that attending classes should be mandatory, I firmly agree with the view that it should be optional for students. There are several reasons that support this perspective.First and foremost, university students are adults who have the capacity to make their own decisions. By making class attendance optional, it allows students to take responsibility for their own learning and time management. This, in turn, helps students develop essential life skills such as prioritization, goal-setting, and self-motivation.Another significant advantage of optional class attendance is that it caters to different learning styles and needs. Some students may learn better through self-study and online resources, while others may benefit from the traditional classroom setting. By allowing students to choose, universities can accommodate diverse learning preferences and abilities, ultimately leading to better academic outcomes.Moreover, mandatory class attendance can be counterproductive, particularly for students who have other commitments such as part-time jobs, family responsibilities, or health issues. By giving students the flexibility to attend classes or not, universities can promote a healthier work-life balance and reduce student stress.In conclusion, making class attendance optional for university students is a more effective and student-centered approach. It promotes autonomy, accommodates diverse learning needs, and fosters a more balanced and productive academic experience. By trusting students to make their own decisions about attendance, universities can empower them to take ownership of their learning and succeed in their academic pursuits.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;The advent of telephones and email has revolutionized the way people communicate, but it has also led to a debate about the personal nature of interactions. In my opinion, I agree that telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. One of the primary reasons for this is the lack of nonverbal cues that are inherent in face-to-face interactions. When communicating via telephone or email, we miss out on important cues like body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.Another reason is the impersonal nature of digital communication. Emails, in particular, can come across as cold and impersonal, lacking the warmth and empathy that is often conveyed through in-person conversations. Furthermore, the ease and speed of digital communication can also lead to a lack of thoughtfulness and reflection in our interactions. We often find ourselves dashing off quick emails or texts without fully considering the impact of our words, leading to a lack of depth and meaning in our communications.For example, consider the difference between receiving a handwritten letter from a friend versus a brief text message. The handwritten letter conveys a sense of care and effort, while the text message can come across as hurried and impersonal. In conclusion, while telephones and email have undoubtedly made communication more convenient and efficient, I believe they have also contributed to a decline in the personal nature of our interactions. As we increasingly rely on digital communication, it is essential to make an effort to maintain the personal touch that is so vital to building and maintaining meaningful relationships.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, there are two distinct options: small towns and big cities. While some people prefer the tranquility and close-knit community of small towns, others thrive in the hustle and bustle of big cities. Personally, I prefer to live in a big city.One of the main advantages of living in a big city is the vast array of opportunities it offers. For instance, New York City, one of the world's most populous cities, is a hub for career advancement, entertainment, and cultural diversity. The city is home to numerous multinational corporations, startups, and institutions, providing a wide range of job opportunities. Additionally, big cities like Tokyo and London offer unparalleled access to world-class education, healthcare, and cultural events.In contrast, small towns, while peaceful and serene, often lack the diversity and opportunities that big cities provide. For example, a small town like Mayberry, with a population of less than 10,000, may have limited job opportunities, few entertainment options, and limited access to quality healthcare and education. However, it's worth noting that small towns have their own unique charm, with strong community bonds and a slower pace of life.Despite the drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of living in a big city outweigh those of living in a small town. The energy, diversity, and opportunities that big cities offer make them ideal for individuals who value career advancement, cultural experiences, and personal growth. In conclusion, while small towns have their own advantages, I prefer to live in a big city, where I can pursue my goals, experience different cultures, and enjoy the vibrancy of urban life.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;As humans, we are often faced with the decision of whether to stick to what we know and do well, or to venture out and try new things. While some people prefer to play it safe and only do what they already do well, I firmly believe that trying new things and taking risks is the more rewarding and beneficial approach.One of the primary reasons I prefer to try new things is that it allows for personal growth and development. When we step out of our comfort zones and attempt new tasks, we challenge ourselves and discover new strengths and abilities. For instance, I had never played a musical instrument before, but I decided to take a risk and join a music class. Not only did I learn to play the guitar, but I also gained confidence in my ability to learn new skills.Another reason I prefer to try new things is that it leads to new experiences and opportunities. When we are willing to take risks, we open ourselves up to new relationships, experiences, and knowledge. For example, traveling to a new country can be intimidating, but it also provides the opportunity to immerse oneself in a new culture, meet new people, and gain a fresh perspective on life.In conclusion, while doing what we already do well may provide a sense of comfort and security, I believe that trying new things and taking risks is essential for personal growth, development, and new experiences. By embracing uncertainty and challenging ourselves, we can discover new passions, develop new skills, and lead more fulfilling lives. Therefore, I firmly believe that trying new things and taking risks is the more preferable approach, and one that I will continue to pursue in my own life.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;I strongly agree with the statement that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age in order to become financially responsible adults. Acquiring financial literacy from a young age is crucial for developing healthy money habits and a sense of responsibility. When children are taught how to manage their own money, they learn valuable skills such as budgeting, saving, and spending wisely.Learning to manage money at a young age allows children to make mistakes and learn from them in a low-stakes environment. For instance, if a child makes a poor purchasing decision with their allowance, they can learn from the experience without suffering significant financial consequences. This trial-and-error process helps build their financial confidence and decision-making abilities.Moreover, teaching children to manage their own money fosters a sense of independence and self-reliance. As they grow older, they will be better equipped to handle more complex financial responsibilities, such as paying bills, managing debt, and investing. By introducing financial concepts early on, parents and educators can lay the foundation for a lifetime of financial stability and security.In conclusion, learning to manage money at a young age is essential for becoming financially responsible adults. By teaching children the basics of personal finance and allowing them to practice money management, we can empower them to make informed financial decisions and set them up for long-term financial success. As such, it is imperative that we prioritize financial education and provide children with the tools and knowledge necessary to navigate the complexities of the financial world. By doing so, we can raise a generation of financially savvy and responsible individuals.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;I strongly agree with the statement that dancing plays an important role in a culture. Dancing has been an integral part of human expression and identity throughout history, and its significance extends beyond mere entertainment. It serves as a means of storytelling, cultural preservation, and community building.For instance, the traditional Japanese Kabuki dance is a highly stylized form of dance that tells stories of myth, legend, and history. Similarly, the Indian classical dance, Bharatanatyam, is a sacred dance that conveys emotions and narratives from ancient Hindu scriptures. These examples illustrate how dance is used to pass down cultural heritage, myths, and values from one generation to the next.Furthermore, dancing often brings people together, fostering a sense of community and social bonding. The Samba dance in Brazil, for example, is a vibrant expression of joy and celebration that unites people during the annual Carnival festivities. In many African cultures, dance is used to mark important life events such as weddings, births, and coming-of-age ceremonies, highlighting its role in strengthening social ties and reinforcing cultural traditions.In addition, dance has the power to evoke emotions, challenge social norms, and promote cultural exchange. The iconic American choreographer, Martha Graham, is a testament to the impact of dance on modern society, as her works challenged conventional norms and paved the way for future generations of dancers.In conclusion, dancing indeed plays a vital role in a culture, serving as a means of cultural preservation, community building, and emotional expression. Its significance is evident in the numerous traditional and contemporary dance forms that exist worldwide, each carrying unique cultural values, stories, and histories. As a universal language, dance has the power to unite people across cultures, making it an indispensable aspect of human expression and identity.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;I strongly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. While learning facts is essential, understanding the underlying ideas and concepts is crucial for deeper comprehension and application of knowledge. Facts are merely pieces of information that can be easily forgotten or looked up, whereas ideas and concepts provide a framework for critical thinking and problem-solving.When students focus solely on memorizing facts, they often lack the ability to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information. On the other hand, understanding ideas and concepts enables students to make connections between different pieces of information, identify patterns, and think creatively. This, in turn, helps them to develop a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the subject matter.Moreover, understanding ideas and concepts prepares students for an ever-changing world where new information and technologies are constantly emerging. By grasping the underlying principles and concepts, students can adapt more easily to new situations and apply their knowledge in innovative ways. In contrast, a focus on memorizing facts can lead to a narrow and rigid approach to learning, which can hinder students' ability to think critically and respond to new challenges.In conclusion, while learning facts is important, it is more crucial for students to understand ideas and concepts. This approach to learning fosters deeper understanding, critical thinking, and creativity, all of which are essential skills for success in the 21st century. By prioritizing the understanding of ideas and concepts, educators can help students develop a more profound and lasting appreciation of knowledge, and equip them with the skills and flexibility to thrive in an increasingly complex and dynamic world.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;I agree with the statement that at universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. While academic pursuits are undoubtedly the primary focus of higher education, the benefits of sports and social activities cannot be overstated.Firstly, sports and social activities provide students with essential life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These skills are invaluable in the workplace and can give graduates a competitive edge in the job market. Moreover, participating in sports and social activities can help students develop important qualities like discipline, resilience, and time management, all of which are crucial for achieving academic success.Secondly, sports and social activities play a vital role in promoting student well-being and mental health. University life can be highly stressful, and extracurricular activities provide a much-needed outlet for students to relax, socialize, and recharge. For instance, many universities have reported a significant reduction in student stress and anxiety levels among students who participate in sports and social activities.Finally, equal financial support for sports and social activities can also have a positive impact on student recruitment and retention. Universities that offer a wide range of extracurricular activities are often more attractive to prospective students, and students who participate in these activities are more likely to stay enrolled and engaged. For example, a study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association found that student-athletes have higher graduation rates and greater overall satisfaction with their university experience compared to non-athletes.In conclusion, sports and social activities are essential components of the university experience, providing students with valuable life skills, promoting well-being, and enhancing the overall student experience. Therefore, I firmly believe that they should receive equal financial support as classes and libraries.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we access information, and opinions are divided on whether this has been beneficial or detrimental. While some argue that the internet provides people with a wealth of valuable information, I agree with the view that access to so much information creates problems.On the one hand, the internet has made it possible for people to access a vast array of information from anywhere in the world. This has been particularly beneficial for students and researchers who can now access academic journals, articles, and books with ease. However, on the other hand, the sheer volume of information available online can be overwhelming, making it difficult for people to discern what is accurate and reliable. This has led to the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can have serious consequences.Furthermore, the ease of access to information has also led to a culture of instant gratification, where people expect to find answers to complex questions with just a few clicks. This has resulted in a lack of critical thinking and analysis, as people rely on search engines to provide them with quick fixes rather than taking the time to understand the underlying issues. For example, a student who is researching a topic may simply copy and paste information from a website rather than taking the time to read and understand the material.In conclusion, while the internet does provide people with a lot of valuable information, I believe that access to so much information creates more problems than benefits. The spread of misinformation, the lack of critical thinking, and the culture of instant gratification are all significant concerns that need to be addressed. As such, it is essential that we learn to navigate the internet responsibly and critically evaluate the information that we find online.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The debate on whether universities should require students to take classes in many subjects or specialize in one subject has been ongoing. In my opinion, having a broad-based education that covers many subjects is better than specializing in one subject. This approach has several benefits, including fostering well-rounded individuals, a broader range of career options, and promoting interdisciplinary learning.Firstly, taking classes in many subjects allows students to explore their interests and strengths, which may not be immediately apparent. For instance, a student who thinks they want to major in engineering may discover a passion for languages or psychology after taking an introductory course. By requiring students to take classes in various subjects, universities can help students make informed decisions about their academic and career paths.Secondly, a broad-based education prepares students for an increasingly complex and interconnected world. Employers often seek graduates who can think critically, communicate effectively, and work collaboratively across disciplines. For example, a business graduate who has studied environmental science can develop sustainable business practices, while a computer science major who has studied sociology can design more user-friendly and socially responsible software.In contrast, specializing in one subject can lead to a narrow focus that may not equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to adapt to changing circumstances. In conclusion, universities that require students to take classes in many subjects provide a more comprehensive education, better preparing students for a rapidly evolving job market and a complex world. By exposing students to various disciplines, universities can foster creative problem-solvers, critical thinkers, and innovative leaders who can navigate the challenges of the 21st century.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize space exploration or focus on addressing basic needs on Earth has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that exploring outer space is essential for human advancement, I firmly believe that governments should allocate their resources towards meeting the fundamental needs of their citizens on Earth.First and foremost, the pressing issues of poverty, hunger, and inadequate healthcare require immediate attention and funding. Millions of people around the world lack access to basic necessities like clean water, food, and shelter. It is the responsibility of governments to ensure that their citizens' fundamental needs are met before venturing into expensive space exploration projects. By investing in social welfare programs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, governments can significantly improve the quality of life for their citizens.Moreover, the financial burden of space exploration is substantial, and the costs of such endeavors could be redirected towards solving the myriad problems that plague our planet. For instance, the budget for a single space mission could be used to build hospitals, schools, and provide aid to underprivileged communities. In addition, the technological innovations that arise from space research can also be applied to solve Earth-based problems, such as developing more efficient renewable energy sources or improving agricultural productivity.In conclusion, while space exploration has its merits, I believe that governments should prioritize the basic needs of their citizens on Earth. By doing so, they can create a more equitable and sustainable society, which in turn can provide a stronger foundation for pursuing scientific and technological advancements, including space exploration, in the future.

There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me.

282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;I disagree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. While it may seem like a fair and effective way to measure teacher performance, the reality is that it is a complex and potentially flawed system. Firstly, paying teachers based on student learning outcomes would create an environment of competition rather than collaboration among educators. Teachers might focus more on students who are easier to teach, rather than those who need extra attention, thereby widening the gap between high-achieving and low-achieving students. Secondly, it would be extremely difficult to measure student learning accurately and fairly. Standardized tests and exams are not the only indicators of student learning, and they do not account for individual differences in learning styles and abilities. Moreover, factors such as socio-economic status, class size, and availability of resources would significantly impact student learning outcomes, making it challenging to determine the effectiveness of a teacher.Lastly, this approach might lead to teachers teaching only for the test, rather than focusing on the overall development of their students. This would undermine the broader goals of education, such as promoting critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. In conclusion, while the intention behind paying teachers according to student learning outcomes is to improve educational standards, it is a simplistic solution to a complex problem. A more holistic approach that takes into account the various factors influencing student learning and teacher performance is needed to truly evaluate the effectiveness of educators.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;I partially agree with the statement that movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. On one hand, depicting good people being rewarded and bad people being punished can have a positive impact on society. It can promote moral values and reinforce the idea that honesty, integrity, and hard work are ultimately rewarded. This can be especially influential for children and young adults who are still developing their moral compass.On the other hand, presenting only these types of stories can lead to an unrealistic portrayal of life. In reality, bad people are not always punished, and good people are not always rewarded. Sometimes, bad deeds can go unpunished, and good people can face unjust treatment. If movies and television programs only show one outcome, it can create unrealistic expectations and disappointments in real life. Moreover, it can also limit the complexity and depth of storytelling, as many great stories are based on the nuances and gray areas of human nature.Additionally, presenting a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of life can also serve as a commentary on social issues and prompt important discussions. For instance, a movie that portrays a corrupt system where bad people thrive can spark conversations about the need for reform. Therefore, while I agree that movies and television programs should promote moral values, I also believe that they should strive to depict life in all its complexity, including the imperfections and injustices, to provide a more realistic and thought-provoking viewing experience.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we learn, making distance learning and online computer classes a viable alternative to traditional classroom learning. In recent years, the notion that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning has gained significant traction. While some may argue that the traditional classroom setting is essential for effective learning, I firmly believe that distance learning and online computer classes can be a more efficient and effective way to learn.One of the primary advantages of distance learning and online computer classes is flexibility. Students can access course materials and learn at their own pace, without being confined to a traditional classroom setting. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for students who have work or family commitments, or those who live in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Additionally, online classes can be tailored to meet the individual needs of students, providing a more personalized learning experience.Another significant advantage of distance learning and online computer classes is cost-effectiveness. Online courses often require minimal infrastructure and resources, making them a more affordable option for students. Furthermore, online classes can reach a wider audience, reducing the need for physical classrooms and minimizing the environmental impact of commuting to and from school. Moreover, online classes provide access to a vast array of educational resources, including video lectures, interactive simulations, and online discussions, which can enhance the learning experience.However, it is also important to note that distance learning and online computer classes may not be suitable for all students, particularly those who require hands-on training or face-to-face interaction. Nevertheless, with the advancement of technology, the quality and effectiveness of online classes are continually improving. In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes offer a flexible, cost-effective, and personalized learning experience, making them a suitable replacement for traditional classroom learning. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that online learning will become an increasingly popular and effective way to learn.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;Throughout my life, I have had numerous experiences that have profoundly shaped my outlook and the way I live. One of the most significant experiences was moving to a new country during my teenage years. This transition forced me to adapt to a new culture, language, and environment, which taught me the importance of resilience and flexibility. As a result, I have become more open-minded and willing to take on new challenges, which has greatly enhanced my personal and professional growth.Another experience that has had a lasting impact on my life is volunteering at a local community center. Witnessing the struggles and hardships faced by many individuals and families made me appreciate the value of gratitude and empathy. This experience has instilled in me a sense of social responsibility and compassion, which has led me to prioritize giving back to my community and helping those in need.Additionally, experiencing failure and setbacks has also played a crucial role in shaping my outlook. Initially, I struggled to cope with disappointment and self-doubt, but over time, I have come to realize that failure is an essential part of the learning process. This realization has allowed me to develop a growth mindset, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and improvement. As a result, I have become more confident and motivated, with a renewed sense of purpose and direction.In conclusion, these experiences have collectively shaped my outlook and the way I live by teaching me valuable lessons about adaptability, empathy, and resilience. They have enabled me to cultivate a positive and optimistic mindset, allowing me to navigate life's challenges with greater ease and confidence. As I continue to navigate life's journey, I am grateful for these experiences and look forward to the new lessons and opportunities that lie ahead.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;The debate about whether it is better to learn a foreign language in one's own country or in the country where it is spoken has been ongoing for a long time. Both methods have their advantages, and the best approach depends on individual circumstances and goals. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of each approach and argue that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is more effective.On the one hand, learning a foreign language in one's own country has several advantages. Firstly, it is often more convenient and cost-effective, as students do not have to travel abroad or worry about living expenses. Additionally, language schools and tutors in one's own country can provide structured lessons and materials, which can be helpful for beginners. Moreover, students can learn at their own pace and can easily access resources and support when needed.On the other hand, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken offers unparalleled opportunities for immersion and practice. Surrounding oneself with native speakers, cultural events, and authentic materials can greatly enhance language proficiency and understanding of nuances. Moreover, students can engage in real-life conversations, listen to different accents, and develop their listening and speaking skills more effectively. For example, a student learning Spanish in Spain can participate in conversations with locals, watch Spanish TV shows, and read Spanish newspapers, all of which can accelerate their learning process.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in one's own country has its benefits, I believe that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken provides a more comprehensive and immersive experience. The opportunity to engage with native speakers, practice language skills in real-life situations, and absorb the culture can lead to faster progress and greater fluency. Ultimately, the choice between these two approaches depends on individual preferences and circumstances, but for those who can afford it, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is likely to be the more rewarding experience.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would change the lack of public transportation. My hometown is a small, suburban area with limited options for getting around without a car. This can be frustrating for residents who do not own a vehicle or prefer not to drive. For instance, many elderly individuals in my community have difficulty accessing basic necessities like grocery stores and healthcare facilities because they are unable to drive themselves. Moreover, the absence of public transportation also affects the environment, as more people rely on personal vehicles, leading to increased air pollution and traffic congestion. To illustrate, during rush hour, the main roads in my hometown become jammed with cars, causing lengthy delays and contributing to the town's carbon footprint. By introducing a reliable and efficient public transportation system, such as buses or trains, we could significantly reduce the number of cars on the road, resulting in cleaner air and less traffic.Additionally, a public transportation system would also benefit local businesses and boost the economy. With easier access to various parts of town, residents would be more likely to shop and dine at local establishments, thereby supporting the local economy. For example, a bus route connecting the town center to outlying shopping districts would encourage residents to explore and patronize these areas, ultimately benefiting the town's commercial development. In conclusion, introducing a public transportation system would greatly enhance the quality of life for residents, support local businesses, and contribute to a more sustainable environment, making it the one important thing I would change about my hometown.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;I strongly agree that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. This practice has several benefits, including improved teacher performance, enhanced student learning experience, and increased accountability. By soliciting feedback from students, teachers can identify areas where they need to improve, such as communication, clarity, or availability. For instance, a teacher may discover that they are not providing sufficient examples to illustrate complex concepts, leading them to adjust their teaching methods to better meet the needs of their students.Moreover, student evaluations can help schools make informed decisions about teacher development and support. If a teacher consistently receives low ratings from students, the school administration can provide targeted training or mentoring to help that teacher improve. On the other hand, teachers who receive high ratings can serve as models for best practices, sharing their effective teaching strategies with colleagues. This not only boosts teacher morale but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement within the school.Another significant advantage of student evaluations is that they give students a voice in their education. By valuing their opinions, schools demonstrate a commitment to student-centered learning and encourage students to take an active role in their academic experience. This can lead to higher student engagement, motivation, and overall satisfaction with their education. For example, a student may suggest a different teaching method or resource that they find more engaging, which the teacher can then incorporate into their lessons.In conclusion, asking students to evaluate their teachers is a simple yet effective way to promote teaching excellence, student satisfaction, and school accountability. By leveraging student feedback, schools can create a more supportive and effective learning environment that benefits both students and teachers. Therefore, I firmly believe that student evaluations of teachers should be a standard practice in educational institutions.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;When it comes to choosing a workplace, individuals often have different preferences. Some people prefer to work for a large company, while others prefer to work for a small company. As for me, I would prefer to work for a small company. There are several reasons that support my choice.Firstly, small companies offer a more intimate and dynamic work environment. With fewer employees, the workplace tends to be more close-knit, and everyone knows each other's names and roles. This leads to better communication, collaboration, and teamwork. In a small company, I can easily approach my supervisor or colleagues to discuss ideas or concerns, which fosters a sense of community and belonging.Secondly, small companies often provide more opportunities for growth and development. Since there are fewer employees, each person is likely to take on more responsibilities and wear multiple hats. This allows me to gain a wide range of skills and experiences, which can be beneficial for my future career. In contrast, large companies often have a more rigid hierarchy, where employees may be limited to a specific role or department.Lastly, small companies tend to be more agile and adaptable to changes in the market. Without the bureaucratic red tape, they can quickly respond to new trends and innovate, which makes the work more exciting and challenging. In a small company, I can see the direct impact of my work on the overall success of the business, which gives me a sense of purpose and motivation.In conclusion, I prefer to work for a small company due to its intimate work environment, opportunities for growth, and adaptability to changes. These factors create a more engaging, collaborative, and dynamic workplace, where I can thrive and contribute to the company's success.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;The debate surrounding the accessibility of higher education has sparked intense discussion among educators and policymakers. On one hand, some individuals believe that college or university education should be available to all students, regardless of their academic background or performance. On the other hand, there are those who argue that higher education should be reserved for students who demonstrate academic excellence.In my opinion, I firmly believe that higher education should be available to all students. Firstly, education is a fundamental right that every individual deserves, and restricting access to it based on academic performance would be unfair. Every student has the potential to learn and grow, and higher education provides them with the opportunity to explore their interests and develop their skills. Moreover, making higher education accessible to all would lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which is essential for the economic growth and development of a country.Furthermore, limiting higher education to only good students would lead to a lack of diversity in the academic environment. Students from different backgrounds and with varying levels of academic achievement bring unique perspectives and experiences to the classroom, which enrich the learning experience for everyone. Additionally, higher education institutions have support systems in place, such as tutoring and academic advising, to help students who may be struggling academically.In conclusion, I strongly believe that higher education should be available to all students, regardless of their academic performance. It is essential for personal growth, economic development, and social mobility. By providing equal access to higher education, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The debate on whether students should be allowed to play computer games has been a contentious issue for years. While some argue that playing computer games can have cognitive and social benefits, I firmly believe that it is a waste of time and students should not be allowed to play it.First and foremost, playing computer games can be a significant distraction from academic responsibilities. Students who spend excessive time playing games often neglect their homework, studying, and other important tasks, leading to poor grades and a lack of understanding of crucial concepts. Moreover, the time spent playing games could be better utilized for reading, learning new skills, or engaging in physical activities that promote overall well-being.Furthermore, excessive gaming can have negative effects on students' physical and mental health. Prolonged periods of sitting in front of screens can lead to obesity, eye strain, and poor posture, while the competitive nature of some games can cause stress, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem. Additionally, the violent and aggressive content of some games can desensitize students to the consequences of violent behavior, potentially leading to aggressive behavior in real life.Instead of playing computer games, students should focus on developing important life skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. They should engage in extracurricular activities, sports, and volunteer work that foster teamwork, empathy, and social responsibility. By doing so, students can develop into well-rounded individuals who are equipped to succeed in their future endeavors.In conclusion, playing computer games can be a significant waste of time for students, distracting them from their academic responsibilities and potentially harming their physical and mental health. Therefore, students should not be allowed to play computer games, and instead, should focus on developing important life skills and engaging in activities that promote their overall well-being and future success.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;The debate about whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or via email has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I firmly believe that working on projects in person is more effective and beneficial than relying on emails. First and foremost, face-to-face interactions facilitate better communication and collaboration. When team members work together in person, they can engage in spontaneous discussions, share ideas, and build on each other's strengths. This leads to a more cohesive and innovative final product. In contrast, email communication can lead to misinterpretations, delays, and a lack of clarity, ultimately hindering the project's progress.Moreover, in-person collaboration fosters a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. When individuals work together physically, they are more likely to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility, leading to increased motivation and productivity. This collective energy is often lost when team members are isolated and relying solely on email communication.Additionally, working in person allows for immediate feedback and problem-solving. If team members encounter obstacles or have questions, they can address them promptly, rather than waiting for email responses. This expedites the project timeline and ensures that deadlines are met.While email communication has its advantages, such as convenience and flexibility, I believe that the benefits of in-person collaboration far outweigh the drawbacks. In today's digital age, it's easy to get caught up in the convenience of email, but when it comes to working on projects, face-to-face interaction is still the most effective way to ensure success. By working together in person, classmates and colleagues can tap into each other's creativity, expertise, and enthusiasm, ultimately leading to a more successful and rewarding project experience.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The role of university professors has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they should focus more on research, while others believe they should prioritize educating students. In my opinion, the primary responsibility of university professors is to educate students, and therefore, they should spend more time on teaching and mentoring.While research is a crucial aspect of academic development, it is not the only responsibility of professors. Students attend universities to gain knowledge, skills, and guidance from experienced educators. Professors have a unique opportunity to shape young minds and inspire future leaders, innovators, and thinkers. By spending more time with students, professors can provide personalized attention, feedback, and support, which are essential for students' academic and personal growth.Moreover, professors who prioritize teaching can create a more engaging and interactive learning environment. They can design curricula that are relevant, up-to-date, and tailored to the needs of their students. This, in turn, can lead to higher student satisfaction, better academic performance, and increased graduation rates. Furthermore, professors who are actively involved in teaching can also serve as role models, demonstrating the importance of education and the value of lifelong learning.That being said, research is also a vital component of academic life, and professors should be encouraged to pursue their research interests. However, this can be achieved through a balanced approach, where professors allocate specific times for research and other times for teaching and mentoring. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between these two important aspects of academic life, ensuring that professors can contribute to the advancement of knowledge while also inspiring and educating the next generation of leaders. By prioritizing teaching, professors can make a more direct and lasting impact on their students' lives, which is, in my view, their most important responsibility.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The debate about whether one learns better by themselves or with a teacher has been ongoing for a long time. While some people prefer the traditional method of learning with a teacher, others believe that self-study is more effective. In my opinion, I think that both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, learning with a teacher provides a structured and guided approach to education. A teacher can offer personalized attention, answer questions, and provide feedback, which can be incredibly valuable. Additionally, a teacher can help to keep students motivated and on track, ensuring that they stay focused and meet deadlines. For example, in a classroom setting, a teacher can facilitate discussions, debates, and group work, which can enhance the learning experience and promote critical thinking.On the other hand, self-study allows individuals to learn at their own pace, which can be particularly beneficial for those who need more time to grasp certain concepts. Without the pressure of a classroom environment, students can review material as many times as they need to, and can learn in a setting that is comfortable and convenient for them. Furthermore, self-study encourages independence, self-motivation, and self-discipline, all of which are essential skills for success in today's fast-paced world.Ultimately, I believe that a combination of both methods is the most effective way to learn. With the guidance and support of a teacher, as well as the flexibility and autonomy of self-study, individuals can achieve a deeper understanding of the subject matter and develop a love for learning that will last a lifetime. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, students can maximize their learning potential and achieve their academic goals.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;The advent of technology has undoubtedly transformed the way we live, work, and interact with one another. While its primary intention is to simplify our lives, it often has the opposite effect,. Instead of making life easier, technology can introduce new complexities and challenges that we never anticipated. For instance, the proliferation of social media platforms was meant to facilitate communication and connection. However, it has led to an overwhelming influx of information, constant distractions, and the pressure to maintain a curated online persona.Furthermore, the rise of smart home devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) was designed to streamline household chores and enhance convenience. Yet, it has resulted in a maze of interconnected systems that require constant updates, troubleshooting, and security patches. The supposed simplicity of technology has given way to a complex web of dependencies and potential vulnerabilities. Even simple tasks, like adjusting the thermostat or locking the front door, now require a working knowledge of Wi-Fi networks and mobile apps.In addition, the increased reliance on technology has also created new anxieties and stressors. The fear of missing out (FOMO), the pressure to stay connected, and the anxiety of dealing with technical issues have all become prevalent concerns. The supposed convenience of technology has, in many cases, been replaced by a sense of obligation and responsibility to stay abreast of the latest developments and maintain our digital lives. In conclusion, while technology has the potential to simplify our lives, it often introduces new layers of complexity and challenge. As we continue to develop and integrate technology into our daily lives, it is essential to consider the unintended consequences and strive for a more balanced and simplified approach to technological innovation.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way we approach education, offering flexibility and accessibility to a broader audience. However, the debate surrounding the efficacy of these programs compared to traditional in-person college or university attendance persists. In my opinion, while distance-learning programs have their advantages, I partially agree that they may not be as effective as in-person education in certain aspects.On the one hand, distance-learning programs provide unparalleled flexibility, allowing students to manage their time effectively and balance other responsibilities alongside their studies. This is particularly beneficial for working professionals or those with family commitments who cannot afford to attend traditional classes. Moreover, the reach of distance-learning is global, enabling students from diverse geographical locations to access high-quality educational content that might not be available locally.On the other hand, in-person education at a college or university offers a unique set of benefits that distance-learning programs may struggle to replicate. The interpersonal interactions, face-to-face discussions, and immediate feedback from instructors and peers are invaluable aspects of the learning experience. These elements not only enhance academic understanding but also foster important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Furthermore, the campus environment exposes students to a wide range of extracurricular activities, social events, and networking opportunities that are crucial for personal and professional development.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs have transformed the educational landscape and are undoubtedly beneficial for many, I believe that they lack the holistic educational experience provided by in-person attendance at a college or university. The combination of academic learning, interpersonal skills, and personal growth opportunities makes traditional education uniquely valuable. Nonetheless, distance-learning programs will continue to play a significant role in education, especially for those who require flexibility or access to education that is not readily available to them otherwise. Ultimately, the choice between distance-learning and traditional education should be based on an individual's circumstances, preferences, and goals.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";In many countries, it is common for teenagers to have part-time jobs while pursuing their studies. I strongly believe that this is a good idea, and it provides numerous benefits for the teenagers. Firstly, having a job while being a student teaches teenagers valuable life skills such as time management, responsibility, and independence. By balancing work and school, they learn to prioritize tasks, manage their time effectively, and make important decisions.Moreover, a part-time job provides teenagers with an opportunity to earn their own money, which can help them develop a sense of financial responsibility. They can use their earnings to purchase necessities, pay for extracurricular activities, or even save for college tuition. This financial independence can boost their self-esteem and motivation, as they feel more in control of their lives. Additionally, having a job can also broaden their social network, as they interact with people from diverse backgrounds and learn to communicate effectively with coworkers and customers.However, it is crucial to note that the job should not interfere with their academic performance. Many countries have laws that restrict the number of hours teenagers can work, ensuring that their studies remain the top priority. If managed correctly, having a job can be a win-win situation for teenagers, as it supplements their education with practical experience and essential life skills. In conclusion, I firmly believe that having a job while being a student is a good idea, as it fosters independence, responsibility, and valuable life skills that will benefit them in the long run.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;The debate on whether it is more effective to learn a foreign language in one's own country or in the country where it is spoken has been ongoing. Both methods have their advantages, and the better option depends on individual preferences and circumstances. In this essay, I will argue that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is more beneficial.On the one hand, learning a foreign language in one's own country has its advantages. For instance, it is often more convenient and less expensive than traveling abroad. Additionally, students can learn from qualified teachers who are familiar with the local culture and can provide personalized attention. However, this method lacks the immersion and cultural experience that comes with living in a foreign country.On the other hand, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken offers unparalleled opportunities for language acquisition. Surrounding oneself with native speakers, students can pick up nuances of the language, such as idioms, expressions, and accents, which may be difficult to learn in a classroom setting. Moreover, living in a foreign country provides ample opportunities to practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing in real-life situations, thereby enhancing language proficiency. For example, doing everyday tasks like grocery shopping, using public transportation, or interacting with locals can help learners develop practical language skills.In conclusion, while learning a foreign language in one's own country has its benefits, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is more effective. The immersive experience and cultural exposure that comes with living in a foreign country cannot be replicated in a classroom setting, making it the better option for those who want to become proficient in a foreign language.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate over whether students should have one long vacation or several short vacations throughout the year has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that a single, prolonged break is beneficial, I firmly believe that having multiple short vacations is more advantageous for students.Firstly, shorter vacations help to prevent burnout and maintain momentum in academic performance. With several breaks throughout the year, students can recharge and refocus, leading to improved concentration and productivity in the classroom. For instance, a mid-semester break can provide a much-needed respite from the rigors of academic life, allowing students to relax and come back to their studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm.Moreover, frequent short vacations can also promote better time management and organization skills. When students know they have regular breaks, they are more likely to prioritize their tasks and manage their time effectively, ensuring that they stay on top of their schoolwork and extracurricular activities. This, in turn, helps to reduce stress and anxiety, creating a healthier and more balanced learning environment.In contrast, a single long vacation can lead to a significant lapse in learning, making it difficult for students to adjust to the academic routine upon their return. Furthermore, a prolonged break can also lead to a lack of structure and routine, potentially resulting in unhealthy habits and a sedentary lifestyle.In conclusion, having several short vacations throughout the year is, in my opinion, the more beneficial approach. It allows students to maintain a healthy work-life balance, prevents burnout, and fosters essential life skills such as time management and organization. By incorporating regular breaks into the academic calendar, educational institutions can create a more supportive and productive learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of their students.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"I strongly agree with the statement ""Never, never give up"" as it emphasizes the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving one's goals. This phrase, coined by Winston Churchill, has inspired countless individuals to push through challenges and stay committed to their objectives. In my opinion, giving up is not an option when striving for success, as it can lead to missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential.One compelling reason to support this statement is that every great achievement requires persistence and hard work. For instance, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously known for saying ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His unwavering dedication to his craft ultimately led to a groundbreaking innovation that revolutionized the world. Similarly, many successful individuals, such as J.K. Rowling and Stephen King, faced numerous rejections before their work was recognized, but they never gave up on their dreams.Moreover, giving up can have severe consequences, including regret and disappointment. When individuals abandon their goals, they often wonder what could have been if they had persisted. On the other hand, persevering through obstacles can foster personal growth, build resilience, and develop valuable skills. By never giving up, individuals can learn from their mistakes, adapt to new situations, and ultimately achieve their objectives.In conclusion, the phrase ""Never, never give up"" is a powerful reminder to stay committed to our goals, even in the face of adversity. By embracing this mindset, we can unlock our full potential, achieve greatness, and make a lasting impact. As Churchill so eloquently put it, ""Never, never give up"" is a mantra that can inspire us to push beyond our limits and strive for excellence."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The age-old debate about whether to spend or save one's earnings has sparked intense discussion among individuals. While some argue that it is better to enjoy one's money when it is earned, others claim that saving for the future is the more prudent approach. In my opinion, it is better to strike a balance between enjoying one's earnings and saving for the future.On the one hand, enjoying one's money when it is earned can bring immense happiness and satisfaction. For instance, taking a vacation or buying something one has always wanted can provide a sense of fulfillment and relaxation. Moreover, spending money on experiences, such as traveling or learning a new skill, can create lifelong memories and personal growth. For example, a person who has always wanted to learn how to play the guitar can spend their earnings on lessons, which can bring them joy and a new hobby.On the other hand, saving for the future is crucial for financial security and stability. Saving for retirement, emergencies, or big-ticket items, such as a house or a car, can provide peace of mind and freedom from financial stress. For example, a person who saves a portion of their earnings each month can build an emergency fund, which can help them weather unexpected expenses, such as car repairs or medical bills.In conclusion, rather than adopting an all-or-nothing approach, it is better to find a balance between enjoying one's earnings and saving for the future. By allocating a portion of one's income towards savings and another portion towards enjoyable experiences, individuals can reap the benefits of both worlds. This balanced approach can lead to a more fulfilling and secure life, where one can enjoy the present while also preparing for the future.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;The debate between living life at a fast pace and a slow pace has been a longstanding one. While some individuals thrive in a hurried environment, I personally prefer to take my time and live life at a slower pace. In my opinion, this approach allows for a more enjoyable and fulfilling experience.One of the primary reasons I prefer a slower pace is that it enables me to appreciate the little things in life. When I'm not rushing from one task to another, I can take the time to observe my surroundings, and appreciate the beauty of nature, art, and music. For instance, taking a leisurely walk in a park or forest allows me to notice the vibrant colors of flowers, the songs of birds, and the warmth of the sun on my skin. This, in turn, helps me to feel more connected to the world around me and reduces my stress levels.Another reason I prefer a slower pace is that it allows for more meaningful relationships and experiences. When I'm not in a hurry, I can engage in more in-depth conversations with friends and family, and participate in activities that bring me joy, such as reading, painting, or playing music. For example, I recently took a cooking class with a friend, and we spent the entire day learning how to make a new dish. The experience was not only enjoyable, but also allowed us to bond over our shared love of food and cooking.In conclusion, while some people may thrive in a fast-paced environment, I firmly believe that taking my time and living life at a slower pace is the key to a happier and more fulfilling life. By slowing down, I can appreciate the beauty of the world around me, nurture meaningful relationships, and engage in activities that bring me joy.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;I disagree with the point of view that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. While it is true that humans require land for various purposes, I believe that preserving land for endangered species is equally, if not more, important.Firstly, preserving land for endangered animals is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem balance. Endangered species play a vital role in their respective ecosystems, and their loss can have severe consequences on the environment. For instance, the decline of bees, which are essential pollinators, can have devastating effects on agricultural production. By saving land for these species, we can ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our ecosystems.Secondly, there are alternative solutions to meet human needs without encroaching on endangered species' habitats. For example, vertical farming and urban planning can help reduce the demand for land while still providing for human needs. Additionally, sustainable practices such as reforestation and renewable energy can minimize the impact of human activities on the environment.Lastly, saving land for endangered animals can also have economic benefits. Eco-tourism, which is based on preserving and appreciating natural habitats, can generate significant revenue and create jobs. Furthermore, preserving natural habitats can also help to preserve natural resources such as water and soil, which are essential for human survival.In conclusion, while human needs are important, I believe that saving land for endangered animals is equally crucial. By adopting sustainable practices and alternative solutions, we can meet human needs while also preserving the natural world for future generations. It is our responsibility to protect and preserve the environment, and saving land for endangered species is an essential part of this effort.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that attending classes should be mandatory, others believe it should be optional. In my opinion, I agree that attending classes should be optional for students.Firstly, requiring students to attend classes can be counterproductive and may lead to a lack of interest in the subject matter. When students are forced to attend classes, they may not be fully engaged, which can negatively impact their learning experience. On the other hand, making attendance optional allows students to take ownership of their learning and attend classes that are relevant and interesting to them. This approach can foster a more motivated and focused learning environment.Another reason why I believe attending classes should be optional is that it allows students to manage their time more effectively. University students often have multiple commitments, such as part-time jobs, research projects, and extracurricular activities. By not requiring attendance, students can prioritize their tasks and manage their time in a way that suits their individual needs. This flexibility can lead to improved productivity and better work-life balance.Moreover, optional attendance can also promote self-directed learning and independence. When students are not required to attend classes, they are forced to take responsibility for their own learning, which can help them develop important skills such as time management, self-motivation, and critical thinking. This approach can better prepare students for the real world, where they will be expected to work independently and manage their own time.In conclusion, while some may argue that mandatory attendance is necessary to ensure students stay on track, I firmly believe that optional attendance is the way forward. By giving students the freedom to choose when and how they attend classes, we can promote a more engaging, flexible, and independent learning experience.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The advent of technology has been a subject of debate regarding its impact on people's lives. While some argue that technology complicates lives, I firmly believe that it simplifies them. With the advancement of technology, people have access to a vast array of tools and services that make everyday tasks more efficient and convenient.One of the primary ways technology simplifies lives is by providing instant access to information and services. The internet, for instance, allows people to shop, pay bills, and communicate with others from the comfort of their own homes. This eliminates the need for physical travel, saving time and energy. Additionally, mobile devices enable people to stay connected and access information on the go, making it easier to manage daily schedules and responsibilities.Technology also automates many mundane tasks, freeing up time for more leisurely pursuits. For example, smart home devices can control lighting, temperature, and security, making household management more streamlined. Furthermore, online banking and financial services reduce the need for physical visits to banks, allowing people to manage their finances with greater ease.Moreover, technology has also improved healthcare, education, and transportation, making these essential services more accessible and efficient. Telemedicine, for instance, allows patients to consult with doctors remotely, reducing the need for hospital visits. Online educational resources provide access to a wealth of knowledge, enabling people to learn new skills and expand their knowledge at their own pace.In conclusion, technology has undoubtedly made people's lives simpler. By providing instant access to information and services, automating mundane tasks, and improving essential services, technology has saved people time, energy, and effort. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely to bring even more simplicity and convenience to people's lives, making it an indispensable part of modern living.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";I strongly agree with the statement that the media pays too much attention to the personal lives of famous people, such as public figures and celebrities. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for newspapers, magazines, and television shows to focus on the private lives of celebrities, often at the expense of more substantial and meaningful news.One of the primary reasons for this is the public's insatiable appetite for gossip and scandals. The media caters to this demand, as it is a lucrative business. Tabloids and celebrity-focused magazines thrive on revealing intimate details about the personal lives of famous individuals, often invading their privacy and disregarding their right to keep certain aspects of their lives private. This not only affects the celebrities themselves but also sets a bad precedent for the type of content that is deemed acceptable and desirable by the general public.Furthermore, the excessive attention paid to celebrities' personal lives comes at the cost of more serious and impactful news. Important issues such as politics, economics, and social welfare are often overshadowed by frivolous stories about celebrity relationships, fashion choices, and personal scandals. This shift in focus undermines the media's role as a source of reliable and informative news, instead turning it into a form of entertainment that prioritizes sensationalism over substance.In conclusion, the media's preoccupation with the personal lives of famous people is a trend that needs to be reassessed. By prioritizing meaningful and impactful news, the media can reclaim its role as a trustworthy source of information and contribute to a more informed and engaged public. It is essential for the media to strike a balance between entertaining the public and informing them, rather than obsessing over the private lives of celebrities.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;The age-old debate about whether to stay in one place or move in search of another has sparked intense discussion among individuals. While some people prefer to stay in one place, citing the comfort and familiarity it brings, others argue that moving in search of another place is essential for personal growth and exploration. As for me, I prefer moving in search of another place.Moving to a new place allows me to experience different cultures, meet new people, and gain new perspectives. It broadens my horizon and helps me to become more adaptable and resilient. Moreover, moving to a new place provides me with opportunities to learn new skills, take on new challenges, and pursue new passions. Whether it's a new job, a new hobby, or a new interest, moving to a new place gives me the chance to reinvent myself and discover new aspects of my personality.On the other hand, staying in one place can lead to stagnation and complacency. When we stay in one place for too long, we can become too comfortable and miss out on opportunities that could help us grow and develop as individuals. Furthermore, staying in one place can limit our exposure to new ideas, experiences, and ways of thinking, which can hinder our personal and professional development.In conclusion, while staying in one place has its advantages, I believe that moving in search of another place is essential for personal growth, exploration, and development. It allows us to experience new things, meet new people, and gain new perspectives, which can help us become more well-rounded and open-minded individuals. So, if given the choice, I would definitely prefer moving in search of another place.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;The decision of where to live while attending university is a significant one, as it can greatly impact a student's overall experience. Two popular options are living in university dormitories and living in apartments in the community. Both options have their advantages, and the choice ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities.Living in university dormitories offers several benefits. Firstly, it provides students with a sense of community and camaraderie, as they are surrounded by fellow students who share similar experiences and interests. Additionally, university dormitories are often conveniently located on or near campus, making it easy for students to attend classes and participate in extracurricular activities. Dormitories also typically offer a range of amenities, such as dining halls, recreational facilities, and study lounges, which can enhance the overall university experience.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the community can provide students with a greater sense of independence and autonomy. Students can choose their own roommates, decorate their own space, and cook their own meals, which can be a welcome change from the structure and rules of dormitory life. Apartments in the community may also be more cost-effective, especially for students who are willing to share a space with multiple roommates.Personally, I would prefer to live in university dormitories during my first year of study. I believe that the social benefits and convenience of dormitory life would be invaluable in helping me to adjust to university life and make lasting connections with my peers. However, in subsequent years, I may consider moving to an apartment in the community, as I would appreciate the independence and flexibility that it offers. Ultimately, the choice of where to live depends on individual priorities and preferences, and both options have their unique advantages and disadvantages.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;"The statement ""In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct"" is a contentious issue that sparks debate among individuals. While some may argue that speed is paramount in today's fast-paced world, I firmly disagree with this assertion.Working quickly and risking mistakes can lead to a plethora of negative consequences. For instance, in fields such as healthcare, finance, and engineering, mistakes can have severe and even fatal repercussions. The importance of accuracy and precision in these fields cannot be overstated, and rushing through tasks can compromise the quality of work. Moreover, mistakes can damage one's reputation, lead to financial losses, and even put people's lives at risk.On the other hand, working slowly and ensuring everything is correct may take more time, but it guarantees a higher level of quality and reliability. In many industries, attention to detail and meticulousness are essential skills that distinguish professionals from amateurs. By working diligently and methodically, individuals can produce work that is not only accurate but also innovative and effective. Furthermore, taking the time to verify and validate work can prevent costly mistakes and ensure that the final product meets the required standards.In conclusion, while speed is important in today's world, it should not come at the expense of accuracy and quality. Working slowly and making sure that everything is correct is often the better approach, as it ensures that the work produced is reliable, efficient, and effective. By prioritizing precision and attention to detail, individuals can produce work that is truly exceptional and valuable. Ultimately, it is better to take the time to get things right than to rush and risk making mistakes that can have far-reaching consequences."
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;The notion that university students do not need to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam has sparked intense debate. While some argue that attending classes is unnecessary, I firmly disagree with this statement. Attending classes is a crucial aspect of the university experience, and it offers numerous benefits that extend beyond mere exam preparation.Firstly, attending classes provides students with the opportunity to engage with their professors and peers, which fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Class discussions, which often involve debates, questions, and explanations, help to clarify complex concepts and promote critical thinking. Moreover, attending classes allows students to receive immediate feedback on their performance, enabling them to identify areas where they need improvement. This interactive learning environment cannot be replicated through self-study or online resources alone.Furthermore, attending classes helps students to develop essential life skills, such as time management, communication, and teamwork. By participating in class activities, students learn to work collaboratively, articulate their thoughts, and manage their time effectively. These skills are highly valued by employers and are essential for success in the professional world.Additionally, attending classes provides students with access to resources and support that may not be available through online materials. Professors often provide additional guidance, recommendations, and mentorship, which can be invaluable in helping students to achieve their academic and career goals.In conclusion, while passing exams is an important aspect of university life, attending classes is essential for a comprehensive education. It provides students with a richer learning experience, opportunities for personal growth, and access to valuable resources and support. Therefore, I strongly disagree that attending classes is unnecessary as long as students can pass the exam.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;I strongly agree with the statement that to improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money on salaries for university professors. One of the primary reasons for this is that higher salaries would attract and retain top talent in the academic field. When professors are well-compensated, they are more likely to be motivated and dedicated to their work, which in turn benefits the students. For instance, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that universities that offered higher salaries to their professors saw a significant increase in the quality of research and teaching.Another reason is that professors who are paid a decent salary are more likely to focus on their teaching and research rather than having to take on additional work to make ends meet. This allows them to devote more time and energy to their students, resulting in better guidance, mentorship, and academic support. Furthermore, universities that invest in their professors' salaries are more likely to see an improvement in student outcomes, such as higher graduation rates and better job placement after graduation.Additionally, offering competitive salaries to professors can also enhance the reputation of the university, making it more attractive to potential students and faculty. For example, universities like Harvard and Stanford are known for their high academic standards and also offer their professors some of the highest salaries in the industry. As a result, they are able to attract the best students and faculty from around the world, creating a vibrant and stimulating academic environment.In conclusion, investing in university professors' salaries is a crucial step in improving the quality of education. By attracting and retaining top talent, allowing professors to focus on their work, and enhancing the university's reputation, higher salaries can have a direct and positive impact on student outcomes and academic excellence. Therefore, universities should prioritize spending more money on salaries for university professors to provide a better learning experience for their students.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The statement ""Pets should be treated like family members"" has sparked a heated debate among animal lovers and critics alike. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement. Pets, especially dogs, cats, and other domesticated animals, have become an integral part of our lives, providing companionship, affection, and unconditional love. They bring joy, comfort, and a sense of responsibility to our daily lives, which is similar to the role of human family members.Treating pets like family members means providing them with the same level of care, attention, and respect that we would offer to our human loved ones. This includes providing a safe and comfortable living environment, nutritious food, regular exercise, and timely medical care. It also involves spending quality time with them, engaging in play, and showing affection and empathy. By doing so, we strengthen the bond between humans and animals, and promote a sense of mutual understanding and trust.Moreover, treating pets like family members has numerous benefits for both humans and animals. It can help reduce stress, anxiety, and loneliness in humans, while also improving the mental and physical health of pets. It can also foster a sense of community and social responsibility, as pet owners become more mindful of their pet's needs and well-being.In conclusion, I firmly believe that pets should be treated like family members. They deserve our love, care, and respect, and in return, they provide us with companionship, affection, and a deeper sense of connection. By recognizing pets as valued members of our families, we can promote a culture of compassion, empathy, and kindness, and create a more harmonious and loving relationship between humans and animals. Ultimately, treating pets like family members is not only a moral obligation, but also a rewarding and enriching experience that can bring joy and fulfillment to our lives."
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;I strongly disagree with the statement that in today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. While speed and efficiency are certainly valuable in many contexts, accuracy and attention to detail are equally, if not more, important.In many fields, such as medicine, engineering, and finance, mistakes can have serious consequences, including loss of life, financial ruin, or damage to reputation. For instance, a doctor who rushes through a diagnosis and prescribes the wrong medication can put a patient's life at risk. Similarly, an engineer who hurriedly designs a bridge without double-checking calculations can lead to a catastrophic collapse. In such cases, working slowly and ensuring everything is correct is not only preferable but also essential.Moreover, in today's digital age, mistakes can spread quickly and be difficult to rectify. A single incorrect social media post or news article can go viral and cause irreparable harm to individuals or organizations. Therefore, it is crucial to take the time to verify information and ensure accuracy before sharing it with the world.In conclusion, while working quickly can be beneficial in certain situations, it is not more important than working slowly and making sure everything is correct. In fact, attention to detail and accuracy are essential in many fields, and mistakes can have severe consequences. As such, it is imperative to prioritize careful and meticulous work over haste and speed. By doing so, we can ensure that our work is not only efficient but also reliable and trustworthy.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, people often find themselves torn between the charm of small towns and the vibrancy of big cities. As for me, I would prefer to live in a big city. There are several reasons that lead me to this preference, one of which is the vast array of opportunities available in urban areas. Big cities are hubs for education, career advancement, and cultural enrichment, offering a diverse range of job opportunities, top-tier universities, and numerous cultural institutions such as museums, theaters, and concert halls.Another significant advantage of living in a big city is the accessibility and convenience it provides. Cities are well-connected by public transportation, making it easy to get around without the need for a car. Additionally, cities never sleep, with 24/7 amenities and services, ensuring that one can find anything they need at any time. This aspect of city living is particularly appealing to those who value independence and flexibility in their daily routines.Moreover, the diversity that big cities embody is a major draw for me. Cities are melting pots of different cultures, lifestyles, and ideas, providing a unique and stimulating environment. This diversity exposes residents to a wide range of cuisines, festivals, and traditions, enriching their social and cultural experiences. In contrast, while small towns offer a sense of community and tranquility, they often lack the dynamism and multiculturalism that cities provide.In conclusion, while both small towns and big cities have their attractions, my preference leans towards living in a big city. The opportunities for personal and professional growth, the convenience and accessibility of services, and the diverse and vibrant cultural scene all contribute to making city living an exciting and enriching experience. For those who crave a fast-paced, dynamic lifestyle filled with endless possibilities, a big city is undoubtedly the place to call home.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";I strongly disagree with the statement that it is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes. Historic buildings and homes are a vital part of a country's cultural heritage and identity, and preserving them is essential for maintaining a sense of national pride and continuity.These buildings often hold significant historical and architectural value, and their preservation can provide valuable insights into the past, as well as serve as a reminder of the country's development and progress. Moreover, preserving historic buildings can also have economic benefits, as they can attract tourists and support local businesses.In contrast, building new structures, while necessary for modernization and development, can be done in a way that complements and respects the existing historical architecture. The government should prioritize the preservation of historic buildings and homes, as they are irreplaceable and cannot be recreated. Once they are destroyed or neglected, they are lost forever, taking with them a part of the country's history and cultural identity.Furthermore, preserving historic buildings can also promote sustainability and reduce waste, as it reduces the need for new construction materials and minimizes the environmental impact of demolition and new building construction. In conclusion, while building new structures is important for development, it is more important for the government to prioritize the preservation of historic or traditional buildings and homes, as they are a vital part of a country's cultural heritage and identity. The government should allocate sufficient funds to preserve and protect these valuable assets for future generations.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I strongly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Every individual faces challenges and obstacles in their lifetime, and it is how we respond to these experiences that shape us into who we are today. Difficult experiences can be a powerful catalyst for growth, as they force us to adapt,,_REFLECT, and innovate.For instance, consider a student who fails a crucial exam. Initially, the experience may seem devastating and discouraging. However, upon reflection, the student may realize that they underestimated the importance of preparation and time management. This realization can prompt them to alter their study habits and develop more effective learning strategies, ultimately leading to better academic performance in the future. Another example is a person who experiences a job loss or a major career setback. While the immediate aftermath may be stressful and disheartening, this difficult experience can lead to valuable self-reflection and exploration of new career paths or industries that might be a better fit. It can also teach important skills such as resilience, perseverance, and the ability to navigate uncertainty.In conclusion, difficult experiences in our lives often serve as pivotal learning moments. They provide us with unique opportunities to learn from our mistakes, gain new insights, and develop crucial life skills. By embracing challenges and viewing them as stepping stones for growth, we can transform what initially seems like adversity into valuable lessons that enrich our personal and professional lives. Therefore, it is undeniable that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time indeed become valuable lessons for the future.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The statement that drivers should pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic is a contentious issue. In my opinion, I agree with this statement. Implementing a congestion charge can effectively reduce traffic congestion in urban areas, as it would discourage drivers from entering busy city streets during peak hours, thereby decreasing the number of vehicles on the road.One of the primary advantages of such a fee is that it would generate revenue for the city, which could be used to improve public transportation, such as buses and trains, and enhance the overall infrastructure. This, in turn, would provide commuters with more efficient and reliable alternatives to driving, further reducing the number of private vehicles on the road. Additionally, the reduced traffic would lead to lower emissions, resulting in a cleaner and healthier environment for city dwellers.Moreover, a congestion charge would encourage drivers to think twice before embarking on a journey, prompting them to consider alternative modes of transport, such as carpooling or using ride-sharing services. This would not only decrease traffic but also promote a sense of community among commuters. However, it is essential to ensure that such a fee is fair and does not disproportionately affect low-income individuals who may rely heavily on their vehicles for daily commutes.In conclusion, while some may argue that a congestion charge is an unfair penalty on drivers, I firmly believe that the benefits of reduced traffic, improved air quality, and enhanced public transportation outweigh the costs. By implementing such a fee, cities can create a more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation system, ultimately improving the quality of life for urban residents.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";I strongly agree that one of the best ways parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job. Having a part-time job can be a valuable learning experience for teenagers, providing them with essential skills and qualities that will benefit them throughout their lives.Firstly, a part-time job teaches teenagers the importance of responsibility and time management. By juggling work and school commitments, they learn to prioritize tasks,,assistantI strongly agree that one of the best ways parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job. Having a part-time job can be a valuable learning experience for teenagers, providing them with essential skills and qualities that will benefit them throughout their lives.Firstly, a part-time job teaches teenagers the importance of responsibility and time management. By juggling work and school commitments, they learn to prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively. This skill is crucial for success in adult life, where individuals are expected to balance multiple responsibilities and meet deadlines.Additionally, a part-time job provides teenagers with an opportunity to develop important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Interacting with colleagues, customers, and managers helps them build confidence in their ability to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and professions. Moreover, the experience of handling money and making financial decisions helps them understand the value of money and develop good financial habits.Finally, having a part-time job can also boost a teenager's self-esteem and independence. Earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and independence, allowing them to make their own purchasing decisions and take control of their finances. This, in turn, prepares them for the financial responsibilities of adulthood, such as paying bills, saving, and investing.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take a part-time job is an effective way for parents to help their children prepare for adult life. It teaches them valuable skills, provides them with essential life experiences, and fosters independence and responsibility. As such, I firmly believe that a part-time job is a vital step in a teenager's transition to adulthood.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";When it comes to studying, individuals have different preferences. Some students prefer to study alone, while others enjoy studying with a group of students. As for me, I prefer to study with a group of students. This preference stems from the numerous benefits that group studying offers.Firstly, studying in a group allows for the sharing of knowledge and ideas. When students come together to study, they bring their unique perspectives and understanding of the subject matter. This leads to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic, as each member can contribute their insights and clarify any doubts. For instance, I was struggling to understand a particular concept in mathematics, but when I studied with my group, one of my friends was able to explain it in a way that made sense to me.Another advantage of group studying is that it promotes active learning and engagement. When students study together, they are more likely to participate in discussions, ask questions, and engage in activities that reinforce their learning. This interactive approach to learning helps to keep students motivated and focused, as they are able to learn from one another and stay on track. For example, my study group and I would often quiz each other on the material, which helped us to stay on top of our work and retain the information better.In conclusion, I firmly believe that studying with a group of students is the more effective and enjoyable approach. Not only does it allow for the sharing of knowledge and ideas, but it also promotes active learning and engagement. By studying with others, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, stay motivated, and achieve their academic goals. Overall, I find that group studying offers a supportive and collaborative learning environment that is essential for academic success.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;When it comes to career choices, some individuals prefer the freedom and autonomy of being self-employed, while others value the stability and security of working for an employer. As for me, I would rather own a business. This preference stems from the potential for unlimited earning potential, the ability to pursue my passions, and the opportunity to create jobs and contribute to the economy.Owning a business allows me to turn my ideas into reality, creating a product or service that I am passionate about. This sense of fulfillment and purpose is a significant motivator for me. Moreover, being my own boss enables me to make decisions that align with my values and vision, rather than following a predetermined corporate path. I can set my own schedule, choose my own team, and determine the direction of my company.Another reason I prefer owning a business is the potential for financial rewards. As a business owner, my earnings are directly tied to my hard work and dedication, allowing me to reap the benefits of my labor. In contrast, working for someone else often comes with a fixed salary, limiting my earning potential. Additionally, owning a business provides me with the opportunity to create jobs and contribute to the local economy, which is a rewarding aspect of being an entrepreneur.While being self-employed or working for someone else has its own advantages, owning a business offers the perfect blend of autonomy, financial potential, and purpose. It allows me to pursue my passions, create something from scratch, and make a meaningful impact on my community. Therefore, owning a business is the career path that I would choose, as it offers the freedom, flexibility, and fulfillment that I crave.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";The debate about whether a city should preserve its old, historic buildings or replace them with modern ones has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, preserving historic buildings is essential for maintaining a city's cultural and historical identity. These buildings serve as a connection to the past, a reminder of the city's rich history, and a source of pride for its residents.Destroying historic buildings and replacing them with modern ones can lead to a loss of character and uniqueness. For instance, Paris is famous for its historic architecture, such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral, which attract millions of tourists each year. If these buildings were replaced with modern structures, the city would lose its charm and appeal. On the other hand, preserving historic buildings can also have economic benefits, as they can be converted into museums, hotels, or restaurants, creating jobs and generating revenue.Furthermore, preserving historic buildings is also important for environmental reasons. Demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones requires a significant amount of energy and resources, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and waste. In contrast, rebuilding and renovating existing structures can reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact. For example, the city of Barcelona has successfully preserved its historic Gothic Quarter, while incorporating modern amenities and infrastructure, showcasing a model for sustainable urban development.In conclusion, preserving historic buildings is crucial for maintaining a city's cultural heritage, promoting economic growth, and reducing environmental harm. Rather than destroying them, cities should invest in renovating and repurposing these buildings, ensuring their longevity and continued relevance in modern times. By doing so, cities can strike a balance between progress and preservation, creating a unique and thriving urban environment that honors its past while embracing its future.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;I strongly agree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. From a young age, children look up to their parents as role models and learn valuable lessons from them. Parents have a unique opportunity to shape their child's morals, values, and behaviors, making them the most influential teachers in a child's life.One reason why parents are the best teachers is that they provide personalized attention and guidance. Unlike school teachers who have to cater to a large number of students, parents can focus on their child's individual needs and learning style. For instance, my mother taught me how to read and write at home, long before I started school. She made learning fun and engaging, using creative methods that helped me grasp complex concepts easily.Another reason why parents are excellent teachers is that they teach life skills and values that are essential for success. They instill in their children important qualities like honesty, discipline, and responsibility, which are vital for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. For example, my father taught me the importance of hard work and perseverance by sharing stories of his own struggles and triumphs. These lessons have stayed with me and continue to motivate me to this day.Furthermore, parents are always available to their children, providing a constant source of support and guidance. They can offer advice and encouragement at any time, helping their children navigate through life's ups and downs. In conclusion, while formal education is crucial, I firmly believe that parents are the best teachers. They provide individualized attention, teach essential life skills, and offer ongoing support, making them the most effective and influential educators in a child's life.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";I strongly agree with the statement that workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task. Repetition and monotony can lead to boredom, dissatisfaction, and a lack of motivation among employees. When workers are assigned a variety of tasks, they are more likely to stay engaged, motivated, and interested in their work.Doing different tasks during the workday can also help to prevent burnout and reduce stress. When employees perform the same task repeatedly, they may start to feel like they are stuck in a rut, and their work becomes dull and unfulfilling. On the other hand, when they are given a range of tasks to complete, they are able to exercise different skills, challenge themselves, and experience a sense of accomplishment.Additionally, doing different tasks can provide opportunities for workers to develop new skills and broaden their expertise. This can lead to a greater sense of job satisfaction and fulfillment, as well as increased confidence and self-esteem. Moreover, when workers are able to switch between tasks, they are able to take breaks from mentally demanding tasks and recharge their energy, which can improve their overall productivity and performance.In conclusion, incorporating a variety of tasks into the workday can have a significant impact on employee happiness and job satisfaction. By providing opportunities for workers to develop new skills, challenge themselves, and experience a sense of accomplishment, employers can create a more engaging and motivating work environment. Therefore, I firmly believe that workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;I agree with the statement that in order to succeed in a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of the job. While having excellent knowledge of the job is certainly beneficial, it is not the only factor that determines success. Adapting to a new environment, on the other hand, is crucial as it allows an individual to navigate the nuances of the workplace, build relationships with colleagues, and understand the organizational culture.Excellent knowledge of the job can be acquired through training and experience, but the ability to adapt to a new environment is a skill that requires a certain level of emotional intelligence, flexibility, and resilience. A person with excellent knowledge of the job may struggle to apply their skills if they are unable to adapt to the new environment. For instance, they may find it difficult to work with new colleagues, adjust to new work hours, or cope with the stress of a new role.In contrast, a person who is able to adapt quickly to a new environment can learn the job requirements and thrive in their new role. They are able to build strong relationships with their colleagues, understand the expectations of their supervisors, and navigate the challenges of the job with ease. Furthermore, adaptability also enables an individual to be open to new ideas, perspectives, and feedback, which is essential for continuous learning and growth in a new job.In conclusion, while excellent knowledge of the job is important, the ability to adapt to a new environment is more crucial for success in a new job. It is the foundation upon which other skills, including job knowledge, are built. By being able to adapt to a new environment, an individual can set themselves up for success and achieve their goals in their new role.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers has sparked a heated debate about their impact on our lives. While some argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I firmly believe that they have made life easier and more convenient. In my opinion, the benefits of computers far outweigh their drawbacks.Firstly, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate. With the help of emails, social media, and video conferencing, we can now stay connected with friends and family who live far away. This has made it easier to maintain relationships and has saved us time and money that would have been spent on traveling and postage. For instance, I can easily stay in touch with my relatives who live abroad through regular video calls, which has brought us closer together despite the physical distance.Secondly, computers have made it easier for us to access information and learn new things. The internet has made it possible for us to access a vast array of educational resources, including online courses, tutorials, and educational websites. This has enabled us to learn new skills and expand our knowledge at our own pace and convenience. For example, I can now learn a new language or skill from the comfort of my own home, which has opened up new opportunities for personal and professional development.In conclusion, while some people may argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I believe that their benefits far outweigh their drawbacks. Computers have made communication easier, access to information more convenient, and learning more accessible. Overall, computers have made life easier and more convenient, and I believe that their impact will continue to be felt for generations to come.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;I strongly agree with the statement that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Introducing a foreign language at an early age has numerous cognitive, social, and cultural benefits that can last a lifetime. Firstly, young children's brains are highly receptive to new sounds, words, and grammar, making it easier for them to pick up a new language. Research has shown that children who start learning a foreign language early tend to achieve higher proficiency levels than those who start later.Moreover, learning a foreign language at a young age can enhance children's overall academic performance. It can improve their memory, problem-solving skills, and multitasking abilities. For instance, a study in Spain found that students who started learning English in preschool outperformed their peers who started in later years in reading, writing, and math skills. Additionally, learning a foreign language exposes children to different cultures, broadening their perspectives and fostering global understanding.Many countries, such as France and China, have successfully incorporated foreign language learning into their elementary school curricula. In these countries, children as young as five or six years old begin learning a foreign language, and the results have been impressive. These children develop into proficient language speakers, able to communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds. In conclusion, introducing foreign language learning at the start of school can have a profound impact on children's cognitive, social, and cultural development. It is an investment in their future, equipping them with a valuable skill that can open doors to new opportunities in an increasingly interconnected world. Therefore, I firmly believe that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;I disagree with the statement that boys and girls should attend separate schools. While some may argue that single-sex schools provide a more focused and distraction-free learning environment, I believe that co-educational schools offer numerous benefits that outweigh the advantages of separate schools.Firstly, attending a co-educational school allows boys and girls to interact and learn from each other, promoting social skills, empathy, and understanding. By being in the same classroom, students of different genders can share perspectives, challenge each other's ideas, and develop healthy relationships. This interaction is essential in preparing students for the real world, where they will be working and collaborating with people of all genders.Secondly, co-educational schools provide equal opportunities for boys and girls to participate in various activities, such as sports, music, and art. This helps to break down gender stereotypes and allows students to explore their interests without being limited by their gender. For example, a girl may excel in a traditionally male-dominated sport, such as soccer or basketball, while a boy may discover a talent for dance or music.Lastly, attending a co-educational school helps students develop important life skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. By learning alongside students of different genders, boys and girls can develop a deeper understanding of each other's strengths, weaknesses, and perspectives. This, in turn, helps to foster a more inclusive and respectful society.In conclusion, while separate schools may have some benefits, I firmly believe that co-educational schools provide a more comprehensive and well-rounded education. By attending school together, boys and girls can develop essential social, emotional, and academic skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that boys and girls should attend separate schools.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";The age-old debate about the origins of success has sparked intense discussion among individuals from all walks of life. While some argue that success stems from taking risks or chances, others claim that it is the result of meticulous planning. In my opinion, the key to achieving success lies in striking a balance between these two approaches.On one hand, taking risks or chances can lead to unprecedented opportunities and growth. For instance, entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk have revolutionized their respective industries by embracing uncertainty and pushing boundaries. Their willingness to take calculated risks enabled them to innovate and stay ahead of the curve. However, relying solely on chance can be reckless and lead to avoidable failures.On the other hand, careful planning provides a foundation for success by allowing individuals to anticipate and prepare for potential obstacles. A well-thought-out plan can help mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of achieving goals. For example, athletes who meticulously plan their training regimens and strategies often outperform their spontaneous counterparts. Nevertheless, overemphasizing planning can stifle creativity and adaptability.Ultimately, I believe that success arises from a combination of both risk-taking and careful planning. By weighing the potential risks and rewards, individuals can make informed decisions that balance caution with boldness. Thomas Edison's perseverance in inventing the light bulb, despite numerous failures, exemplifies this balanced approach. His careful planning and experimentation were complemented by his willingness to take risks and learn from mistakes. In conclusion, success is not solely the result of taking risks or careful planning, but rather the culmination of a thoughtful and adaptive approach that combines elements of both.
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I strongly agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving world, it is essential to be adaptable and open to new experiences, even if they may not be immediately enjoyable. One of the primary reasons for this is personal growth and development. Engaging in activities that are outside of our comfort zone can help us build resilience, develop new skills, and gain valuable insights.For instance, many students may not enjoy public speaking, but it is a crucial skill to master in order to succeed in their careers. By pushing themselves to participate in debates, presentations, or speeches, they can overcome their fears and become more confident communicators. Similarly, athletes may not enjoy the grueling training sessions, but these are necessary to build endurance and achieve their goals.Furthermore, doing things we do not enjoy can also have practical benefits. For example, paying bills, going to the dentist, or doing household chores may not be enjoyable tasks, but they are essential for maintaining a comfortable and healthy lifestyle. By doing these tasks, individuals can ensure their financial security, physical well-being, and a clean living environment.In conclusion, while it may be tempting to only do things that bring us immediate joy, it is essential to sometimes step out of our comfort zone and do things that we may not enjoy. By doing so, we can develop new skills, build resilience, and achieve our goals. Ultimately, the benefits of doing things we do not enjoy far outweigh the temporary discomfort, and it is a crucial aspect of personal and professional growth.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;I disagree with the statement that it is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes. While new buildings can provide modern amenities and functionality, historic and traditional buildings hold significant cultural, social, and economic value that cannot be replicated by new constructions.Preserving historic buildings allows future generations to learn about and appreciate the past, to understand the historical context and development of a society. These buildings often serve as tourist attractions, generating revenue and promoting local economies. Furthermore, they provide a sense of continuity and identity for communities, establishing a strong connection to their heritage.In addition, preserving traditional buildings can also contribute to sustainable development. Renovating and reusing existing structures reduces the need for new materials and minimizes waste, thereby decreasing the environmental impact associated with construction. This approach aligns with the principles of sustainable development, which prioritize the efficient use of resources and the reduction of pollution.Moreover, the cultural significance of historic buildings can foster a sense of community and social cohesion. They often host cultural events, exhibitions, and public gatherings, which help to strengthen social bonds and promote cultural exchange. By preserving these buildings, governments can invest in the social fabric of their communities, facilitating a richer and more diverse cultural landscape.In conclusion, while investing in new buildings is essential for a country's development, it is equally, if not more, important for governments to allocate funds towards preserving historic and traditional buildings. This not only safeguards cultural heritage but also contributes to sustainable development, community building, and economic growth. A balanced approach that considers both the need for modern infrastructure and the preservation of historical assets is essential for creating a harmonious and thriving society.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The debate about when young adults should gain independence from their parents has sparked intense discussion. While some young adults yearn for independence as soon as possible, others prefer to live with their families for a longer period. In my opinion, living with families for a longer time is a better solution.Firstly, living with families provides young adults with financial stability. The cost of living independently can be overwhelming, especially for those who have just started their careers or are still studying. By living with their families, parents can offer financial support, reducing the burden of expenses such as rent, food, and utilities. For instance, a friend of mine who moved out of his parents' house after graduating had to take on multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, whereas his sibling who stayed with their parents was able to focus on their career without such financial stress.Secondly, living with families allows young adults to develop important life skills under the guidance of their parents. Parents can provide valuable advice and support, helping their children navigate the challenges of adulthood, such as managing finances, cooking, and time management. For example, a young adult who lives with their parents can learn how to cook and manage their diet in a healthy way, rather than relying on fast food or instant noodles.In conclusion, while independence is an essential aspect of adulthood, living with families for a longer time offers numerous benefits, including financial stability and the opportunity to develop important life skills. Rather than rushing into independence, young adults should consider the advantages of living with their families and make the most of this supportive environment.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other, leading to a significant shift in the types of relationships people make. On one hand, technology has made it easier for people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, thereby increasing the scope of potential relationships. Social media platforms, online forums, and messaging apps have enabled people to meet and interact with like-minded individuals who share similar interests and passions. This has led to the formation of diverse and global networks, fostering a sense of community and belonging.On the other hand, technology has also been criticized for its negative impact on relationships. The rise of social media has led to the proliferation of superficial connections, where people present a curated version of themselves, hiding behind a mask of pretence. This can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection, as people substitute online interactions for meaningful, face-to-face relationships. Moreover, the constant stream of information and notifications can create a culture of distraction, making it challenging for people to engage in deep, meaningful conversations.In my opinion, the impact of technology on relationships is a mixed bag. While it has opened up new avenues for connection and community-building, it also poses significant challenges to the depth and intimacy of relationships. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to harness technology in a way that complements and enhances their relationships, rather than replacing them. By being mindful of our online interactions and making a conscious effort to nurture our offline relationships, we can ensure that technology serves as a tool to strengthen our bonds with others, rather than weakening them.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The increasing use and development of new technology has led to a significant shift in the way work is performed. Many machines are now capable of doing tasks that were previously done by humans. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, the advantages of this trend are numerous. For instance, machines can work continuously without getting tired, which increases productivity and efficiency. They can also perform tasks with a high degree of accuracy, which reduces the likelihood of errors. Additionally, machines can work in hazardous environments, reducing the risk of injury to humans. Furthermore, the use of machines can lead to cost savings, as they can perform tasks at a lower cost than human labor.On the other hand, there are also several disadvantages to this trend. One of the main concerns is job loss, as machines replace human workers. This can lead to unemployment and economic instability. Moreover, the reliance on machines can also lead to a loss of skills, as humans become less proficient in tasks that are now performed by machines. Additionally, there is also the risk of machines malfunctioning or breaking down, which can lead to disruptions in production and other problems.In conclusion, the trend of machines replacing human workers has both advantages and disadvantages. While it can lead to increased productivity and efficiency, it also poses a risk to employment and skills. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between the use of machines and human labor, to ensure that the benefits of technology are realized while minimizing the negative consequences. By doing so, we can harness the power of technology to improve our lives, while also protecting the interests of workers and the economy.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The field of information technology (IT) has witnessed tremendous growth over the last two decades, with innovations like the World Wide Web and email communication revolutionizing the way we live and work. However, there is a growing concern that future developments in IT may have more negative effects than positive. While I understand the potential risks associated with IT advancements, I only partially agree with this view.On the one hand, it is true that excessive reliance on IT can lead to negative consequences such as social isolation, cyberbullying, and decreased attention span. Moreover, the increasing amount of personal data being collected and stored online raises concerns about privacy and security. Additionally, the automation of jobs due to advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics may lead to significant job losses, exacerbating social and economic inequalities.On the other hand, I believe that the benefits of future IT developments will outweigh the drawbacks. For instance, emerging technologies like telemedicine and online education platforms have the potential to improve healthcare and access to education, particularly in remote and underprivileged areas. Furthermore, IT innovations can facilitate global connectivity, promote cultural exchange, and foster international cooperation, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and interconnected world.In conclusion, while it is essential to acknowledge the potential negative effects of future IT developments, I do not entirely agree that they will outweigh the positive impacts. By being aware of the risks and taking proactive measures to mitigate them, we can harness the power of IT to create a better, more equitable, and more sustainable future for all.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The notion that media coverage of celebrities is having a detrimental impact on children has sparked a heated debate in recent years. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that the excessive media attention on celebrities can have a negative effect on young minds.On one hand, media coverage of celebrities can create unrealistic expectations and promote materialism among children. The constant bombardment of images and stories of celebrities' lavish lifestyles can lead children to believe that fame and wealth are the ultimate goals in life. This can result in a lack of focus on important values such as education, hard work, and social responsibility. Furthermore, the objectification of celebrities can also lead to the glorification of superficial qualities such as physical appearance, rather than inner qualities like kindness and empathy.On the other hand, it can be argued that media coverage of celebrities can also have a positive impact on children. For instance, some celebrities use their platform to raise awareness about social and environmental issues, inspiring children to get involved in philanthropic activities. Additionally, the achievements of celebrities can motivate children to work hard and pursue their passions. However, I believe that these positive effects are often overshadowed by the negative influence of celebrity culture on children.In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to media coverage of celebrities, I firmly believe that the negative effects outweigh the positive. Parents and caregivers should be mindful of the media their children consume and ensure that they are not excessively exposed to celebrity culture. By promoting a balanced and realistic view of the world, we can help children develop a healthy and positive outlook on life.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, leading to a debate about their impact on social interaction. While some argue that mobile phones destroy social interaction, I disagree with this assertion. In my opinion, mobile phones have transformed the way we interact, but not necessarily destroyed it.On the one hand, mobile phones can indeed lead to social isolation if overused. People often find themselves engrossed in their screens, texting, browsing, or playing games, rather than engaging with those around them. This can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant need to be connected can create a sense of dependency, causing individuals to neglect their surroundings and the people in them.On the other hand, mobile phones have also enabled new forms of social interaction that were previously unimaginable. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have made it possible to stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues across geographical distances. Mobile phones have also facilitated community building and social movements, allowing people to organize, mobilize, and raise awareness about social issues. Furthermore, mobile phones have provided a means of communication for people with disabilities or those living in remote areas, thereby increasing their social inclusion.In conclusion, while mobile phones may have some negative effects on social interaction, they have also opened up new avenues for connection and community building. Rather than destroying social interaction, mobile phones have transformed the way we interact, making it more diverse, accessible, and widespread. By using mobile phones responsibly and balancing screen time with face-to-face interaction, we can harness their potential to enhance our social lives.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern forms of communication, such as email and messaging, has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. While some argue that these technologies have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends,,assistant, thereby negatively impacting their social lives, I partially disagree with this assertion.On the one hand, it is undeniable that email and messaging have made it easier for people to stay in touch with their friends without necessarily having to meet in person. This can lead to a reduction in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining strong social relationships. Moreover, over-reliance on digital communication can lead to social isolation, as people may substitute online interactions for in-person connections.On the other hand, modern forms of communication have also enabled people to stay connected with friends who live far away or have busy schedules, making it easier to maintain relationships that might otherwise fade due to distance or time constraints. Additionally, these technologies have also opened up new avenues for socialization, such as online communities and forums, where people can connect with others who share similar interests.In conclusion, while it is true that modern forms of communication may reduce the amount of time people spend seeing their friends in person, I believe that the negative effects of this trend are mitigated by the numerous benefits that these technologies offer. Ultimately, a balance between digital communication and in-person interaction is key to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling social life. By being mindful of our communication habits and making an effort to regularly meet with friends in person, we can harness the benefits of modern communication technologies while also nurturing our social relationships.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The debate surrounding whether children should be encouraged to compete or co-operate has sparked intense discussion among parents,,assistant, and educators. While some argue that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential, others believe that teaching them to co-operate is more beneficial for their future.On the one hand, promoting competition among children can have numerous benefits. It can motivate them to strive for excellence, push their limits, and develop resilience in the face of failure. Competition can also prepare children for the realities of the adult world, where they will inevitably encounter challenges and setbacks. Moreover, competitive environments can help children develop important life skills such as time management, strategy, and critical thinking.On the other hand, teaching children to co-operate rather than compete can have long-term benefits that make them more useful adults. When children learn to work together towards a common goal, they develop essential social skills like communication, empathy, and teamwork. Co-operation fosters a sense of community and mutual support, which can lead to stronger, more meaningful relationships and a greater sense of social responsibility. Furthermore, co-operative environments can help children develop problem-solving skills, as they learn to share ideas, build on each other's strengths, and navigate conflicts in a constructive manner.Ultimately, a balance between competition and co-operation is likely the most effective approach. By teaching children to compete in a healthy, respectful manner, while also emphasizing the value of co-operation and teamwork, we can help them develop a robust set of skills that will serve them well in all aspects of life. By doing so, we can raise a generation of adults who are not only driven to succeed but also capable of working together to achieve great things.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other, leading to a significant impact on the types of relationships formed. With the rise of social media, online platforms, and messaging apps, the traditional face-to-face interactions have given way to digital communication. On the one hand, technology has made it easier for people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, fostering global friendships and networks. Social media platforms have also enabled people to reconnect with old friends and acquaintances, thereby strengthening existing relationships.On the other hand, the over-reliance on technology has led to a decline in deep, meaningful relationships. Online interactions often lack the emotional intimacy and empathy that in-person interactions provide, leading to superficial connections. Moreover, the constant need for validation through likes and comments on social media can create unrealistic expectations and promote narcissism. Furthermore, the ease of online communication can also lead to social isolation, as people substitute digital interactions for real-life connections.In conclusion, the impact of technology on relationships is a mixed bag. While it has opened up new avenues for connecting with others, it also poses significant risks to the quality and depth of relationships. Ultimately, a balance needs to be struck between the benefits of technology and the need for human connection. By being mindful of our technology use and making an effort to engage in meaningful, in-person interactions, we can harness the positive potential of technology to enhance our relationships, rather than letting it erode them. By doing so, we can ensure that technology serves to augment, rather than replace, the richness and depth of human connection.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;"The advent of technology has undoubtedly transformed the fabric of modern society, ushering in unprecedented advancements and conveniences. However, this rapid progression has also sparked concerns about the erosion of traditional skills and ways of life. While some argue that it is futile to preserve these antiquated practices, I disagree with the notion that it is pointless to try and keep them alive.On one hand, technological development has rendered many traditional skills obsolete, making them seem like relics of a bygone era. For instance, the widespread use of calculators and computers has diminished the need for manual calculations and handwriting. Moreover, the efficiency and speed brought about by technology have made many traditional occupations, such as craftsmanship and artisanal trades, less competitive.On the other hand, traditional skills and ways of life hold significant cultural and historical value. They are often deeply rooted in a community's identity and provide a sense of continuity with the past. Preserving these skills not only helps to maintain cultural diversity but also fosters a sense of community and social cohesion. Furthermore, traditional practices, such as folk medicine and organic farming, can offer valuable insights and alternatives to modern technological solutions.Rather than allowing traditional skills to die out, it is essential to find ways to adapt and integrate them with modern technology. This can be achieved through education and cultural programs that promote the value of traditional practices, as well as initiatives that support the evolution of these skills in a contemporary context. By doing so, we can ensure that the wisdom and heritage of the past continue to enrich our present and future. In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly changed the way we live, it is not pointless to try and keep traditional skills and ways of life alive; instead, it is essential to find a balance between progress and preservation."
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate surrounding the encouragement of competition versus cooperation in children has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some individuals believe that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential for their development. They argue that competition drives children to work harder, strive for excellence, and develop resilience in the face of failure. This, in turn, prepares them for the challenges of the real world, where competition is a ubiquitous aspect of life. Moreover, competition can also enhance children's self-esteem and motivation, as they learn to set goals and achieve them.On the other hand, others contend that teaching children to cooperate rather than compete is more beneficial in the long run. They suggest that cooperation promotes teamwork, empathy, and social skills, which are vital for building strong relationships and achieving collective success. When children learn to work together towards a common goal, they develop essential life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. Furthermore, cooperation can also foster a sense of community and mutual support, leading to more harmonious and productive relationships in adulthood.In my opinion, while competition can be a useful motivator, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is more important. In today's interconnected world, the ability to work collaboratively and build strong relationships is crucial for achieving success. Moreover, cooperation promotes a sense of social responsibility and empathy, which are essential for creating a more compassionate and equitable society. By encouraging cooperation, we can raise a generation of adults who are not only productive and motivated but also caring and committed to the well-being of others. Ultimately, striking a balance between competition and cooperation is key, but I firmly believe that cooperation should be the primary focus in childhood development.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The impact of advertising on society has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it does more harm than good, while others disagree. On the one hand, those who believe that advertising has a negative effect on society point out that it can be misleading and manipulative. Advertisements often create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, leading to unnecessary spending and waste. Furthermore, advertising can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and reinforce social inequalities. For instance, some ads may objectify women or portray certain racial groups in a derogatory manner, contributing to a culture of discrimination and prejudice.On the other hand, some people argue that advertising has numerous benefits for society. It informs consumers about new products and services, helping them make informed decisions about their purchases. Advertising also supports the media and entertainment industries, allowing them to produce high-quality content that educates and entertains the public. Moreover, advertising can promote social causes and raise awareness about important issues, such as environmental conservation and public health. For example, some companies use their advertising budgets to promote recycling and sustainability, encouraging consumers to adopt eco-friendly habits.In my opinion, while advertising can have negative consequences, its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. When done responsibly, advertising can be a powerful tool for promoting social good and supporting economic growth. However, it is crucial for advertisers to be truthful and respectful in their messaging, avoiding manipulation and stereotypes. Ultimately, it is up to consumers to critically evaluate the ads they see and make informed choices about the products and services they support. By promoting responsible advertising practices, we can harness the power of advertising to build a more informed, sustainable, and equitable society.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The art world has long been plagued by inequality, with some artists receiving substantial sums of money for their work while others struggle to make ends meet. The question of whether the government should intervene to resolve this issue is a complex one. In my opinion, I partially agree that government should take steps to address this unfair situation.On the one hand, it is true that the government has a role to play in supporting the arts and ensuring that talented individuals are able to make a living from their craft. By providing funding and resources to struggling artists, it is possible to create a more level playing field and give opportunities to those who may otherwise be overlooked. This could include initiatives such as grants, subsidies, and training programs to help artists develop their skills and showcase their work.On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that the art market is driven by supply and demand, and government intervention can sometimes have unintended consequences. If the government were to start dictating what type of art is worthy of funding, it could stifle creativity and lead to a homogenization of artistic styles. Furthermore, it is difficult for the government to determine which artists are truly talented and deserving of support, and which are not.In conclusion, while I believe that the government has a role to play in supporting the arts, I also think that it is important to be cautious in how this support is provided. Rather than trying to dictate the market or provide blanket funding, the government should focus on creating opportunities and resources for artists to develop their skills and showcase their work. By taking a nuanced and targeted approach, it is possible to create a more equitable and thriving art scene.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The notion that people tend to work longer hours nowadays has sparked a heated debate about the impact of extended working hours on individuals, their families, and society as a whole. In my opinion, I strongly agree that working hours should be restricted due to the plethora of negative effects associated with prolonged working periods.Working long hours can have detrimental effects on an individual's physical and mental health. Prolonged periods of work can lead to stress, fatigue, and a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, excessive working hours can also lead to burnout, resulting in decreased productivity and job satisfaction. When individuals are forced to work long hours, they often sacrifice their personal time, leading to an imbalance in their work-life balance.In addition to the individual effects, working long hours also has a profound impact on families. When parents work extended hours, they often have limited time to spend with their children, leading to a breakdown in family relationships and a lack of parental guidance. This can have long-term consequences on the emotional and psychological development of children. Moreover, the strain on family life can also lead to marital problems and divorce.Lastly, the effects of working long hours can also be felt at a societal level. When individuals work extended hours, they often have limited time to engage in community activities, leading to a decline in social cohesion and community spirit. Moreover, the negative effects on physical and mental health can also lead to an increased burden on the healthcare system, resulting in significant economic costs.In conclusion, the negative effects of working long hours on individuals, their families, and society are undeniable. Therefore, I firmly believe that working hours should be restricted to promote a healthier work-life balance, protect family relationships, and maintain social cohesion. By implementing restrictions on working hours, we can create a more balanced and sustainable society.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The notion that a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money is a common misconception. While financial stability is undoubtedly important, it is not the sole determinant of success. In my opinion, I only partially agree with this statement.On one hand, earning a substantial amount of money can provide comfort, security, and freedom. It can also offer opportunities to pursue one's passions and make a positive impact on society. Many successful entrepreneurs, artists, and philanthropists have achieved their goals and made significant contributions to their fields, and their financial success has enabled them to do so.On the other hand, there are numerous examples of successful individuals who have not prioritized wealth accumulation. For instance, Nobel laureates, human rights activists, and volunteers often dedicate their lives to making a difference without focusing on financial gain. Their success is measured by the positive impact they have on people's lives, the progress they make in their fields, and the fulfillment they derive from their work.Moreover, an overemphasis on financial success can lead to an unbalanced and unhappy life. Many people who have accumulated wealth have done so at the expense of their relationships, health, and personal well-being. In contrast, individuals who prioritize personal growth, meaningful relationships, and contributions to society often report higher levels of happiness and satisfaction.In conclusion, while earning a lot of money can be a component of success, it is not the only measure. A successful person is one who has achieved a balance between financial stability, personal fulfillment, and a positive impact on the world. Ultimately, success is a multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to a single metric, such as wealth.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The notion that high sales of popular consumer goods are driven by the power of advertising rather than real societal needs has garnered significant attention in recent years. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that advertising plays a pivotal role in influencing consumer purchasing decisions, often overshadowing the genuine needs of the society.On one hand, advertising has become an indispensable tool for businesses to create awareness and shape consumer preferences. Through clever marketing strategies and appealing visuals, advertisers are able to create a perceived need for a product, often leading to a surge in sales. For instance, the rise of luxury fashion brands can be attributed to effective advertising campaigns that create an aura of exclusivity and status, rather than catering to a real need for functional clothing.On the other hand, it can be argued that some consumer goods do fulfill genuine societal needs, as they provide solutions to real problems or improve the quality of life. For example, sales of healthcare products or energy-efficient appliances can be attributed to a real need for wellness and sustainability. However, these instances are often overshadowed by the sheer scale of advertising-driven sales of goods that are more driven by desire than necessity.In conclusion, while it is true that some consumer goods do cater to real societal needs, I believe that the power of advertising plays a significant role in driving sales of popular consumer goods. The manipulation of consumer preferences through clever advertising often leads to a mismatch between the goods being sold and the genuine needs of the society. As consumers, it is essential to critically evaluate our purchasing decisions and distinguish between real needs and artificially created desires.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The notion that paying taxes is sufficient contribution to society is a topic of debate. While taxes play a crucial role in funding public goods and services, as well as infrastructure development, some individuals believe that this financial obligation is enough to discharge their social responsibility. However, I disagree with this perspective to a significant extent.On the one hand, paying taxes is undoubtedly a fundamental civic duty. Taxes are used to finance essential public services such as healthcare, education, and national defense, which are vital for the well-being and security of citizens. Moreover, tax revenues support social welfare programs, helping to alleviate poverty and inequality. In this sense, contributing to the tax base can be seen as a form of societal contribution.On the other hand, limiting one's contribution to society to merely paying taxes is a narrow and insufficient perspective. Societal contribution encompasses a wide range of activities beyond financial obligations, including volunteering, community service, environmental conservation, and advocacy for social causes. These actions not only complement government efforts but also foster a sense of community and social cohesion. Furthermore, personal involvement in community affairs can lead to more targeted and effective solutions to local problems, as individuals are more likely to understand the specific needs of their community.In conclusion, while paying taxes is an indispensable contribution to society, it cannot be considered the sole contribution. A more holistic approach to societal contribution involves active participation in community life, volunteering, and advocating for social and environmental causes. Therefore, individuals should look beyond their tax payments and engage in other forms of contribution that enrich their communities and society at large. By doing so, they can create a more profound and lasting impact.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The notion that schools should prioritize teaching academic subjects closely related to future careers, while deemphasizing others like music and sports, is a topic of debate. While I understand the reasoning behind this argument, I strongly disagree with the idea that music and sports are not important.On one hand, it is true that certain academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, and technology, are crucial for many career paths. Teaching these subjects can provide students with a solid foundation for their future professions. However, this does not mean that other subjects like music and sports are irrelevant. In fact, these subjects offer numerous benefits, including fostering creativity, teamwork, and physical well-being.Moreover, music and sports can also play a significant role in shaping a child's overall development, including their social, emotional, and cognitive skills. Participating in sports, for instance, can teach valuable life skills such as discipline, perseverance, and communication. Similarly, music education can enhance cognitive abilities, including memory and spatial-temporal skills. By including these subjects in the curriculum, schools can provide students with a more holistic education, preparing them for a wide range of careers and life experiences.Furthermore, an overemphasis on career-oriented subjects can lead to a narrow and utilitarian view of education, neglecting the importance of personal growth and enjoyment. Schools should strive to provide a balanced education, where students can explore their interests and talents in various fields. By doing so, students can develop a broader range of skills, making them more adaptable and better equipped to navigate an ever-changing world.In conclusion, while academic subjects related to future careers are important, I firmly believe that music and sports are equally vital for a student's overall development. Schools should strive to provide a well-rounded education, where students can explore their passions and interests in various fields, ultimately preparing them for a more fulfilling and successful life.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the internet has led to a significant shift in the way people consume information, with many believing that online content will eventually replace traditional newspapers and magazines. While I understand this perspective, I disagree with the notion that the internet will entirely bring an end to the era of print media.On one hand, it is undeniable that the internet has made it easier for people to access information from anywhere in the world, at any time. Online news platforms and blogs have become increasingly popular, offering up-to-date and diverse content that can be easily shared and accessed. This has led to a decline in the circulation and readership of traditional newspapers and magazines. However, I believe that print media still holds a unique value that online content cannot replicate.For instance, many people still prefer the tactile experience of holding a physical newspaper or magazine, and the in-depth analysis and feature pieces that these publications often provide. Furthermore, print media often offers a level of credibility and trustworthiness that is sometimes lacking in online sources. Newspapers and magazines also provide a curated selection of articles and stories, which can be more engaging and easier to navigate than the vast, often overwhelming, amounts of information available online.In conclusion, while the internet has certainly changed the way we consume information, I do not believe that it will completely replace newspapers and magazines. Instead, I think that print media will continue to evolve and adapt to the digital age, offering a unique and valuable complement to online content. Ultimately, the coexistence of online and print media will provide readers with a range of options and allow them to choose the format that best suits their needs and preferences.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When considering a job offer, the notion that salary is the most important factor is a common perspective. However, I partially disagree with this statement. While a competitive salary is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of any job, it is not the sole determining factor for many individuals.On one hand, a satisfactory salary is essential for meeting living expenses, paying off debts, and achieving financial stability. It is a fundamental consideration, especially for those with financial responsibilities. A good salary can also reflect the value and recognition an employer places on an employee's skills and contributions, thereby boosting morale and job satisfaction.On the other hand, numerous other factors play significant roles in job satisfaction and overall quality of life. Personal fulfillment, job security, opportunities for growth and development, work-life balance, and the work environment are just a few examples. Many individuals prioritize these aspects over salary, especially if they offer a sense of purpose, flexible working conditions, or opportunities for professional advancement. Moreover, research has shown that once basic financial needs are met, additional income does not necessarily lead to greater happiness or job satisfaction.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it is not the only factor, and its importance can vary greatly among individuals. Personal values, career goals, and circumstances all influence what aspects of a job are most valued. Therefore, a balanced approach that considers both financial and non-financial aspects of a job is more likely to lead to overall job satisfaction and a healthy work-life balance. Ultimately, the weight given to salary should be context-dependent, reflecting the unique priorities and needs of each individual.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;The use of computers has become an integral part of daily life, and children are no exception. While computers offer a wealth of information and educational resources, I agree that using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children.On the one hand, excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Furthermore, prolonged screen time can result in eye strain, headaches, and decreased attention span. Additionally, the internet can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying, online predators, and exposure to inappropriate content, all of which can have severe emotional and psychological consequences for children.On the other hand, while computers do offer some educational benefits, such as access to educational software and online resources, these benefits can be outweighed by the negative effects of excessive use. Moreover, excessive computer use can lead to social isolation, decreased face-to-face interaction, and reduced creativity, as children spend more time interacting with screens than engaging in outdoor activities, sports, or creative pursuits.In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for learning and education, the negative effects of excessive use on children's physical and mental health, social skills, and creativity cannot be ignored. Parents and caregivers must establish limits and monitor computer use to ensure that children use computers in a balanced and healthy way. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative effects of computer use and help children reap the benefits of technology while maintaining a healthy and well-rounded lifestyle.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;I partially agree with the opinion that children from low-income families are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life compared to those from wealthy families. On one hand, children from low-income families often develop essential life skills such as budgeting, resourcefulness, and resilience. Growing up with limited financial resources, they learn to appreciate the value of money and make the most of what they have. These skills are crucial in navigating the challenges of adult life, where financial uncertainty and unpredictability are common.On the other hand, children from wealthy families often have a safety net that protects them from the harsh realities of financial struggles. As a result, they may not develop the same level of financial literacy and problem-solving skills as their counterparts from low-income families. However, it is also important to note that wealthy families can provide their children with access to quality education, healthcare, and networking opportunities that can be beneficial in the long run.Moreover, the idea that children from low-income families are better prepared for adult life oversimplifies the complex issues surrounding socioeconomic status and personal development. Factors such as parental guidance, role modeling, and community support play a significant role in shaping a child's ability to cope with adult life, regardless of their family's income level. In conclusion, while children from low-income families may develop certain skills that are beneficial in adult life, as a result of their financial circumstances, it is not accurate to make a blanket statement that they are better prepared than children from wealthy families. Ultimately, a child's preparedness for adult life depends on a variety of factors, including their upbringing, education, and individual character.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that a sedentary lifestyle is a primary contributor to many medical problems in today's world is a widely accepted concept. I strongly agree with this statement, as the evidence suggests that a lack of physical activity is a significant risk factor for a multitude of health issues. With the rise of technology and automation, many people spend most of their day sitting, either at work or at home, resulting in a significant reduction in physical activity.Numerous studies have shown that a sedentary lifestyle is linked to an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Prolonged periods of inactivity can lead to a range of health problems, including high blood pressure, poor circulation, and a weakened immune system. Furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle can also have a negative impact on mental health, with increased rates of anxiety and depression reported in individuals who lead inactive lives.In contrast, regular physical activity has been shown to have numerous health benefits, including weight management, improved mood, and reduced risk of chronic disease. Governments and health organizations around the world are now recognizing the importance of physical activity, and are implementing initiatives to encourage people to lead more active lives. For example, many workplaces are now incorporating wellness programs, which include exercise classes and fitness challenges, to promote physical activity among employees.In conclusion, I strongly agree that a sedentary lifestyle is a significant contributor to many medical problems in today's world. The evidence is clear: regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good physical and mental health. By making small changes to our daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or going for a short walk during our lunch break, we can reduce our risk of developing a range of health problems, and improve our overall wellbeing.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The debate about when to introduce foreign language instruction has sparked intense discussion among educators and linguists. While some argue that it is too early to start teaching foreign languages in kindergarten, I firmly believe that introducing foreign language instruction at this stage is beneficial for young learners. Starting foreign language instruction in kindergarten has numerous advantages. Firstly, it allows children to develop a native-like accent and pronunciation, as their brains are more receptive to new sounds and intonations at a younger age. Additionally, young children are naturally curious and have a knack for picking up languages quickly, making it an ideal time to introduce them to a new language. Moreover, research has shown that learning a foreign language at a young age enhances cognitive development, improves memory, and boosts problem-solving skills.Introducing foreign language instruction in kindergarten also provides a solid foundation for future language learning. As children progress through their educational journey, they will have a head start in language acquisition, which will make it easier for them to build upon their existing knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of the language. Furthermore, in today's increasingly globalized world, being proficient in multiple languages is a valuable skill that can open up numerous opportunities for individuals in their personal and professional lives.In conclusion, I strongly agree that foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. The benefits of introducing a foreign language at a young age far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By starting early, children can develop a strong foundation in a new language, enhance their cognitive abilities, and set themselves up for success in an increasingly interconnected world. As such, I believe that educators and policymakers should prioritize introducing foreign language instruction in kindergarten to give young learners the best possible start in life.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The rise of international tourism has transformed the way people travel and experience different cultures. While some argue that the drawbacks of international tourism surpass its advantages, I partially disagree with this statement. In my opinion, the benefits of international tourism can outweigh its problems, but only if managed sustainably.On the one hand, international tourism can cause significant problems, including environmental degradation, cultural homogenization, and strain on local infrastructure. The influx of tourists can lead to pollution, erosion of natural habitats, and loss of biodiversity. Additionally, the commercialization of local cultures can result in the loss of traditional practices and customs. For instance, the over-tourism in cities like Venice and Barcelona has led to the displacement of local residents and the degradation of historical sites.On the other hand, international tourism can bring numerous economic and social benefits to a country. It can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and promote cultural exchange. Tourism can also contribute to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage sites, as the revenue generated from tourism can be used to fund conservation efforts. Furthermore, tourism can foster global understanding and tolerance, as people from different backgrounds interact and learn from each other.To strike a balance between the benefits and problems of international tourism, it is essential to adopt sustainable tourism practices. This can include implementing measures to reduce waste and pollution, supporting local businesses and communities, and promoting responsible tourist behavior. By doing so, international tourism can become a positive force for economic and cultural development, while also preserving the environment and cultural heritage of a country. In conclusion, while international tourism does pose some problems, its benefits can outweigh its drawbacks if managed in a sustainable and responsible manner.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The statement that children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home because some can learn more efficiently by doing so is a contentious issue. While it is true that visual aids like television can be beneficial for certain learning styles, particularly for those who are visual learners, the idea that children should watch TV regularly for educational purposes is not entirely convincing.On one hand, watching TV can indeed be an engaging and effective way to learn for some children. Educational programs can present complex concepts in an entertaining and easy-to-understand manner, making learning more enjoyable and accessible. This can be especially beneficial for subjects like history, science, or geography, where visual content can enhance understanding and retention.On the other hand, excessive TV watching, even for educational purposes, can have negative effects. It can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contribute to obesity, and affect social skills and physical activity levels. Furthermore, not all TV content is educational or suitable for children, and the risk of exposure to inappropriate material is high. In a school setting, where content can be monitored and curated, this risk is somewhat mitigated, but at home, the onus of ensuring that TV watching remains educational falls on parents, who may not always be able to supervise.In conclusion, while some children may learn more efficiently through watching TV, advocating for regular TV watching both in school and at home as a standard educational practice is not advisable. A balanced approach, incorporating TV as one of many educational tools under controlled conditions, seems more prudent. This way, children can benefit from the educational value of TV without being exposed to its potential downsides. Ultimately, a variety of teaching methods, including but not limited to TV, should be utilized to cater to different learning styles and promote a well-rounded education.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The widespread adoption of the internet has revolutionized the way people work and study, enabling them to do so from the comfort of their own homes. This phenomenon has sparked a heated debate about whether the advantages of working or studying from home outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, the benefits of this arrangement far surpass the drawbacks.On the one hand, working or studying from home offers numerous advantages. For instance, it saves time and money that would be spent on commuting, and also provides a comfortable and distraction-free environment that can boost productivity. Additionally, people with disabilities or those living in remote areas can now access employment and educational opportunities that were previously inaccessible to them. Furthermore, with the absence of office distractions, some individuals can focus better and achieve more in less time.On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to consider. For example, social isolation can occur when people spend too much time alone at home, leading to decreased social skills and increased stress levels. Moreover, the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues or classmates can hinder teamwork and collaboration. However, these drawbacks can be mitigated by scheduling regular video meetings or in-person meetups.In conclusion, while there are some potential downsides to working or studying from home, I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. With the flexibility and comfort it provides, this arrangement can lead to increased productivity, better work-life balance, and improved overall well-being. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that remote work and study will become even more prevalent, and I think this is a positive development that will bring numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The rise of international tourism has led to a surge in cultural exchange between people from diverse backgrounds. While some argue that this phenomenon creates tension between individuals from different cultures, I firmly believe that it fosters understanding and promotes global harmony.On one hand, it is true that cultural differences can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and friction. For instance, tourists may unintentionally offend locals by disregarding customs or traditions, as they are unfamiliar with the host country's norms and values. This may indeed lead to tension between people from different cultures. On the other hand, I believe that the benefits of international tourism in promoting cross-cultural understanding far outweigh the drawbacks. As people travel to foreign countries, they are exposed to new and unfamiliar customs, traditions, and ways of life. This exposure can help to dispel stereotypes and misconceptions, allowing individuals to gain a deeper appreciation and respect for the diversity of human experience.Moreover, tourism provides an opportunity for people to engage with one another, to share ideas, and to learn from each other's perspectives. This exchange can help to break down cultural barriers and foster greater empathy and understanding between nations. In fact, many countries have recognized the potential of tourism to promote cultural diplomacy and have implemented initiatives to facilitate people-to-people diplomacy through tourism.In conclusion, while cultural differences may sometimes lead to tension, I firmly believe that international tourism has the potential to promote greater understanding and cooperation between countries. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is imperative that we recognize the value of cultural exchange and work to promote greater cross-cultural understanding through tourism and other means. By doing so, we can foster a more harmonious and peaceful global community.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The notion that celebrities are more renowned for their glamour and wealth than their accomplishments has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, as it holds some truth, but also has its exceptions.On the one hand, the excessive focus on celebrities' luxurious lifestyles and physical appearances can indeed have a detrimental impact on young people. The media's constant bombardment of images showcasing their opulent homes, iconic fashion sense, and lavish parties can create unrealistic expectations and promote materialism. Young fans may become more enamored with the idea of achieving wealth and fame rather than the hard work and dedication that led to the celebrity's success. This can lead to a distorted view of what is truly important in life, prioritizing superficial qualities over genuine talent and achievements.On the other hand, there are numerous celebrities who use their platforms to promote positive values and showcase their accomplishments. For instance, many actors and musicians utilize their fame to raise awareness for social and environmental causes, inspiring young people to make a difference. Additionally, some celebrities are renowned for their philanthropic efforts, their dedication to their craft, and their perseverance in the face of adversity. These role models demonstrate that success is not solely about glamour and wealth, but about the hard work, passion, and commitment that goes into achieving one's goals.In conclusion, while it is true that some celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth, I believe that this is not a universal truth. There are many positive role models in the celebrity world who promote admirable values and achievements, and it is essential for young people to be exposed to these examples as well. Ultimately, it is crucial for young people to have a balanced perspective and understand that true success is about more than just glamour and wealth.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;I disagree with the statement that children can effectively learn from watching television and therefore should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. While television can be a valuable educational tool, it is not a replacement for traditional teaching methods and hands-on learning experiences.On the one hand, some television programs, such as documentaries and educational shows, can provide children with valuable information and knowledge on various subjects. These programs can spark children's curiosity and interest in learning, and can even help to develop critical thinking skills. However, these benefits can only be realized if children are watching high-quality, educational programming and are guided by parents or teachers to help them understand and apply what they have learned.On the other hand, excessive television watching can have negative effects on children's learning and development. Watching too much TV can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, social isolation, and a decrease in attention span. Furthermore, many television programs are not designed with educational goals in mind, and can actually hinder children's learning by promoting violent or inappropriate behavior.In conclusion, while television can be a useful tool for learning, it should not be relied upon as the primary means of education. Children should be encouraged to engage in a variety of learning activities, including reading, hands-on experiments, and social interactions, in order to develop a well-rounded education. Parents and teachers should guide children in their TV watching, ensuring that they are watching high-quality educational programming, and supplementing TV time with other learning activities.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The notion that workers over 50 are less responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and therefore less preferable to younger workers is a stereotype that deserves scrutiny. While it is true that some older workers may struggle to adapt to new technologies or innovative practices, it is unfair to generalize this as a characteristic of all workers over 50.In reality, many older workers possess valuable skills and experiences that are highly beneficial to the modern workplace. Their years of service have equipped them with a deep understanding of the industry, strong problem-solving abilities, and excellent communication skills. Moreover, their maturity and stability can provide a sense of continuity and leadership in a rapidly changing work environment. It is also worth noting that older workers are often highly motivated and committed to their jobs, which can lead to higher job satisfaction and reduced turnover rates.On the other hand, it is also true that younger workers can bring fresh perspectives, new ideas, and a high degree of technological literacy to the workplace. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are more responsive to change than their older counterparts. In fact, older workers are often more open to learning and professional development than they are given credit for, and many are eager to acquire new skills and adapt to new situations.In conclusion, the idea that workers over 50 are less responsive to change and therefore less preferable to younger workers is an oversimplification that does not reflect the complexity of the modern workplace. Both older and younger workers have their strengths and weaknesses, and a balanced and diverse workforce that includes workers of all ages is likely to be the most effective and innovative. Rather than prioritizing one age group over another, employers should focus on creating a work environment that values and supports the contributions of all workers, regardless of age.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The increasing use of machines in our daily lives has led to a significant reduction in physical work done by humans. While some may argue that this trend is detrimental to human health and productivity, I firmly believe that the advantages of machine usage outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, the advantages of machine usage are numerous. Machines have increased efficiency and productivity in various industries, allowing for faster and more accurate work. For instance, in the manufacturing sector, machines have enabled mass production, thereby reducing production costs and increasing output. Additionally, machines have also improved healthcare by enabling doctors to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively. Machines such as MRI and CT scanners have revolutionized medical imaging, allowing for early detection and treatment of diseases.On the other hand, the reduction in physical work done by humans has led to concerns about the impact on human health. Prolonged periods of inactivity can lead to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other health problems. However, this can be mitigated by incorporating physical activity into our daily routines, such as exercising or engaging in sports. Moreover, machines have also enabled humans to focus on more complex and creative tasks, such as research, innovation, and problem-solving, which are essential for human progress and development.In conclusion, while the increasing use of machines has reduced physical work done by humans, I believe that the advantages of machine usage far outweigh the disadvantages. Machines have improved efficiency, productivity, and healthcare, and have enabled humans to focus on more complex and creative tasks. By incorporating physical activity into our daily routines, we can mitigate the negative effects of reduced physical work and reap the benefits of machine usage.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life become obsolete with the advancement of technology is a widely debated topic. While some argue that it is pointless to preserve traditional practices in the face of technological progress, I disagree with this opinion to a certain extent.On one hand, technological advancements have undoubtedly led to the decline of certain traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, automation and artificial intelligence have replaced many manual labor jobs, rendering some traditional crafts and occupations obsolete. Moreover, attempting to preserve these outdated practices can hinder a country's progress and competitiveness in the global market.On the other hand, I believe that preserving traditional skills and ways of life is essential for maintaining cultural heritage and identity. Many traditional practices, such as craftsmanship, folk music, and indigenous knowledge, are invaluable aspects of a nation's history and cultural diversity. Losing these traditions would not only erase a part of the country's identity but also deprive future generations of their cultural roots. Furthermore, many traditional skills, such as sustainable farming and artisanal craftsmanship, can still be relevant and valuable in today's world, providing unique solutions to modern problems.In conclusion, while it is true that some traditional skills and ways of life may become less relevant with technological advancements, it is not entirely pointless to try and keep them alive. A balanced approach, where traditional practices are preserved and adapted to coexist with modern technology, can help maintain cultural diversity and identity. By embracing and supporting traditional skills and ways of life, a country can ensure that its cultural heritage continues to thrive in the face of technological progress.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The notion that reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is the sole solution to alleviate traffic congestion in cities is a topic of debate. While I agree that minimizing the necessity for daily commutes can significantly contribute to reducing traffic, it is not the only way to address this issue.On the one hand, reducing the need for people to travel can be achieved through flexible work arrangements, as remote work has become increasingly prevalent, allowing employees to work from the comfort of their own homes. Similarly, online education platforms and e-commerce websites can also diminish the need for physical presence in educational institutions and shopping malls. This reduction in travel demand can lead to a considerable decrease in the number of vehicles on the road, thereby easing traffic congestion.On the other hand, there are other effective measures that can be implemented to reduce traffic in cities. For instance, improving public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways, can encourage people to use shared transport, reducing the number of private vehicles on the road. Moreover, urban planning strategies, like creating pedestrian-friendly and cyclist-friendly infrastructure, can also discourage the use of personal vehicles for short distances.In conclusion, while reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping can be a valuable strategy in decreasing traffic congestion, it is not the only solution. A multi-faceted approach that incorporates flexible work and study arrangements, enhanced public transportation, and smart urban planning is necessary to effectively alleviate traffic in cities. By adopting a combination of these strategies, cities can work towards creating a more sustainable, efficient, and congestion-free environment for their inhabitants.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The lives of celebrities are often characterized by glamour and wealth, making them household names. However, their fame is not always a result of their achievements, but rather their ability to capture the public's attention. I agree that taking celebrities as role models can be dangerous for young people, as their lifestyles and values may not be conducive to a healthy and productive life.Many celebrities are famous for their physical appearance, personal relationships, or outrageous behavior, rather than any significant contributions to society. Young people, who are impressionable and easily influenced, may idolize these celebrities and aspire to emulate their lifestyles. This can lead to a focus on superficial qualities such as physical appearance and material possessions, rather than developing meaningful skills and values.Moreover, the constant exposure to celebrity culture can create unrealistic expectations and promote a sense of entitlement among young people. They may feel that they too can become famous and wealthy without putting in the necessary effort and hard work. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of disillusionment when reality does not meet their expectations.Furthermore, the values and behavior promoted by some celebrities can be detrimental to young people's well-being. For example, the glorification of partying, excessive spending, and other reckless behavior can have serious consequences, such as addiction, financial problems, and damaged relationships. Therefore, it is essential for young people to have positive role models who demonstrate values such as hard work, kindness, and responsibility. By looking up to individuals who have achieved success through dedication and perseverance, young people can develop a more realistic and positive understanding of what it takes to succeed in life.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject at universities has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach promotes gender equality, others claim that it undermines the principles of meritocracy and individual choice. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, but with some reservations.On the one hand, accepting equal numbers of male and female students can help to address the historical imbalance in certain subjects, such as engineering and physics, where men have traditionally dominated. By actively encouraging female students to pursue these fields, universities can play a vital role in promoting gender equality and challenging stereotypes. This, in turn, can lead to a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, which benefits all students.On the other hand, I disagree with the idea of imposing rigid quotas, as this can lead to less qualified students being accepted over more qualified ones, simply to meet the quota. This can undermine the academic integrity of the institution and may not ultimately benefit the students themselves. Furthermore, students should be free to choose their subjects based on their interests and abilities, rather than being forced into a particular field to meet a quota.In conclusion, while I agree that universities should strive to create a more balanced and inclusive learning environment, I do not think that accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is the most effective way to achieve this goal. Instead, universities should focus on creating an environment that encourages and supports students of all backgrounds and genders to pursue their academic interests, without imposing rigid quotas or restrictions. By doing so, we can promote true equality and diversity, rather than just numerical balance.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;The statement that all countries should make smoking in public places illegal, except in certain designated areas, is a topic of heated debate. I agree with this statement, as the detrimental effects of smoking on both smokers and non-smokers are well-documented. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide, and second-hand smoke exposure also poses significant health risks.By banning smoking in public places, countries can significantly reduce the number of smoking-related illnesses and deaths. Designated smoking areas can still accommodate smokers, while protecting non-smokers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. This measure can also help to reduce the social normalization of smoking, particularly among young people, and discourage them from taking up the habit.Additionally,, a uniform smoking ban across all countries can facilitate international cooperation and consistency in public health policies. It can also promote a culture of respect for non-smokers' right to clean air and reduce the economic burden of smoking-related healthcare costs. However, it is essential to implement this policy gradually, with adequate public education and support for smokers who want to quit.In conclusion, considering the overwhelming evidence of the harm caused by smoking, I strongly agree that all countries should adopt laws making smoking in public places illegal, except in designated areas. This measure can play a crucial role in protecting public health, promoting a smoke-free culture, and ultimately saving countless lives.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The notion that tourism is a modern form of colonialism is a contentious issue that has sparked intense debate. While it is undeniable that tourism can have negative consequences on local economies and the environment, I only partially support this idea. On one hand, tourism can indeed be seen as a form of colonialism, where wealthy nations exploit the resources and attractions of poorer countries for their own benefit. This can lead to the distortion of local economies, as the influx of tourists creates an artificial demand for certain goods and services, driving up prices and making them unaffordable for locals.Moreover, tourism can also cause significant environmental damage, as the construction of hotels, resorts, and other tourist infrastructure can lead to the destruction of natural habitats and the depletion of natural resources. Additionally, the sheer number of tourists can put pressure on local infrastructure, leading to issues such as overcrowding, pollution, and strain on local resources. However, on the other hand, tourism can also be a powerful tool for economic development and cultural exchange. When managed sustainably, tourism can provide jobs, stimulate local economies, and promote cross-cultural understanding.Many countries, such as Costa Rica and New Zealand, have successfully implemented sustainable tourism models, which prioritize environmental protection and community engagement. In conclusion, while tourism can have negative consequences, it is not entirely accurate to describe it as a modern form of colonialism. Instead, it is a complex and multifaceted industry that requires careful management and planning to ensure that its benefits are shared equitably and its negative impacts are mitigated. By adopting sustainable tourism practices, we can promote economic development, cultural exchange, and environmental protection, and create a more equitable and responsible tourism industry.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The last two decades have witnessed unprecedented advancements in the field of information technology (IT), revolutionizing the way we communicate, interact, and access information. The advent of the World Wide Web and email has been particularly instrumental in bridging geographical divides and fostering global connectivity. However, the notion that future developments in IT will have more negative effects than positive is a perspective that warrants scrutiny.On one hand, it is plausible to argue that future IT developments could have adverse consequences. For instance, the increasing reliance on automation and artificial intelligence could lead to significant job displacement, exacerbating unemployment and socioeconomic disparities. Furthermore, the proliferation of social media and online platforms has already been linked to concerns over privacy, data security, and the spread of misinformation. These issues could potentially escalate with the evolution of IT, leading to more pronounced negative impacts.On the other hand, it is equally compelling to suggest that the benefits of future IT developments will outweigh the drawbacks. Emerging technologies such as blockchain, advanced data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) hold immense promise for solving complex global challenges, including healthcare access, environmental sustainability, and educational inequalities. For example, telemedicine and health informatics can improve healthcare delivery to remote and underserved populations, while smart city initiatives can enhance energy efficiency and reduce waste.In conclusion, while acknowledging the potential negative consequences of future IT developments, it is more reasonable to believe that these advancements will continue to yield more positive than negative effects. With responsible innovation, careful planning, and regulatory oversight, the benefits of IT can be maximized, and its risks mitigated. Ultimately, the trajectory of IT's impact will depend on how societies choose to harness its potential, ensuring that technology serves humanity's best interests.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;The trend of adopting a vegetarian lifestyle has gained significant momentum in recent years, with an increasing number of people choosing to abstain from consuming meat. While animal rights issues are often cited as a primary motivation, many individuals are turning to vegetarianism for reasons that extend beyond ethical concerns. In agreement with this perspective, the reasons for embracing a vegetarian diet are multifaceted and varied.One major reason people are opting for a vegetarian diet is for health benefits. A well-planned vegetarian diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and aid in weight management. Many individuals are making the switch to vegetarianism as a proactive measure to improve their overall health and wellbeing. The high costs associated with meat consumption, both economically and environmentally, also play a role in this decision. Plant-based diets tend to be more cost-effective and have a lower carbon footprint compared to meat-based diets, appealing to those looking to live more sustainably.Furthermore, some people are drawn to vegetarianism due to cultural and social influences. With the rise of social media, plant-based recipes and lifestyle choices are becoming increasingly popular, showcasing the diversity and richness of vegetarian cuisine. This exposure can inspire individuals to explore vegetarian options, not necessarily out of concern for animal welfare, but because of the appeal of new culinary experiences and the desire to fit into certain social circles that prioritize sustainable living.In conclusion, while animal rights issues remain a powerful motivator for some, it is evident that the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet is driven by a broad spectrum of reasons, including health benefits, economic considerations, environmental concerns, and social influences. As the world becomes more aware of the implications of dietary choices, it is likely that the trend towards vegetarianism will continue, driven by a complex interplay of factors that extend far beyond the realm of animal rights alone.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The rapid advancement of technology has led to a significant shift in the way people live and work. As a result, some argue that traditional skills and ways of life are becoming obsolete and that it is futile to attempt to preserve them. While I acknowledge that technological progress can render certain traditional practices redundant, I disagree with the notion that it is pointless to try and keep them alive.On the one hand, traditional skills and ways of life are an integral part of a country's cultural heritage and identity. They provide a sense of continuity and connection to the past, and their loss can lead to a disconnection from one's roots. Furthermore, many traditional skills, such as craftsmanship and artisanal practices, are still highly valued and sought after today. Preserving these skills not only helps to maintain cultural diversity but also provides a means of livelihood for many individuals.On the other hand, I do acknowledge that some traditional practices may no longer be relevant or practical in today's technological age. However, this does not mean that they should be allowed to die out completely. Instead, efforts can be made to adapt and evolve these traditional skills to make them relevant and useful in contemporary society. For example, traditional farming practices can be combined with modern technology to create sustainable and efficient agricultural systems.In conclusion, while technological advancement can make some traditional skills and ways of life obsolete, it is not entirely pointless to try and keep them alive. Preserving cultural heritage and traditional practices is essential for maintaining a sense of identity and continuity, and with adaptation and evolution, they can continue to thrive in a modern technological society.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";The debate surrounding the effectiveness of capital punishment in controlling violence has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that the death penalty is essential to maintain security and deter violent crimes, I disagree with the notion that our lives are less secure without it.Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that capital punishment has not been proven to be an effective deterrent against violent crimes. Many studies have shown that the rates of violent crimes are not significantly lower in countries or states that practice capital punishment compared to those that do not. For instance, countries like Norway and Sweden, which have abolished the death penalty, have some of the lowest crime rates in the world. This suggests that the relationship between capital punishment and crime rates is more complex than initially thought.Moreover, it can be argued that capital punishment may even exacerbate the problem of violence in society. The use of the death penalty can create a culture of violence and revenge, rather than promoting rehabilitation and restorative justice. Additionally, there is always a risk of executing innocent people, which is a grave miscarriage of justice.Instead of relying on capital punishment, I believe that governments should focus on addressing the root causes of violent crimes, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of education. By investing in social programs and community development, we can work towards creating a safer and more just society. Furthermore, alternative forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment, can provide a suitable substitute for capital punishment, while also allowing for the possibility of rehabilitation and remorse.In conclusion, while the idea that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society may seem compelling, I firmly believe that it is not an effective or just solution. Our lives are not necessarily less secure without the death penalty, and there are more constructive and humane ways to address the problem of violent crime.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some people may view zoos as mere entertainment facilities, I believe they play a vital role in conservation, education, and research. One of the primary purposes of zoos is to provide a safe haven for endangered species. Many zoos participate in breeding programs that help increase the population of species that are on the verge of extinction. For instance, the California Condor Recovery Program, which is a collaborative effort between zoos and wildlife agencies, has successfully increased the condor population from just 22 birds in the 1980s to over 500 today.Zoos also serve as educational institutions, providing people with an opportunity to learn about wildlife and the importance of conservation. By exhibiting a wide range of species, zoos raise awareness about the diversity of life on Earth and the need to protect it. Furthermore, zoos often offer interactive exhibits and programs that teach children and adults alike about the habitats, behavior, and adaptations of various animals. This educational aspect of zoos can inspire people to take action in protecting the environment and conserving wildlife.Additionally, zoos are involved in scientific research that contributes to our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. Many zoos have research centers where scientists study animal behavior, nutrition, and health, which can inform conservation efforts and improve animal care in zoos and in the wild. In conclusion, I firmly believe that zoos have a useful purpose. They are essential for conservation, education, and research, and their contributions to these fields are invaluable. Rather than being merely entertainment facilities, zoos are important institutions that work towards protecting and preserving our planet's precious biodiversity.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";The issue of language extinction has sparked a heated debate about whether governments should allocate public funds to preserve languages spoken by minimal populations. On one hand, some argue that it is essential for governments to invest in saving these languages as they are an integral part of a community's cultural heritage. Languages are a vital component of a nation's identity, and their loss can lead to cultural homogenization and a decline in diversity. Furthermore, language preservation can also promote tourism and create jobs, as people become interested in learning about and experiencing unique cultures. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect governments to take responsibility for safeguarding these languages.On the other hand, others contend that spending public money on saving endangered languages is a waste of resources. They argue that the cost of language preservation programs is substantial, and the funds could be better utilized to address more pressing issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. Moreover, in today's globalized world, the importance of speaking a widely spoken language like English cannot be overstated, and the emphasis should be on teaching these languages to improve job prospects and economic opportunities.In my opinion, while both views have merit, I believe that governments should prioritize language preservation. The cultural significance and historical value of languages far outweigh the costs associated with their preservation. Moreover, the benefits of language preservation, such as cultural diversity and tourism, can have long-term economic benefits. Therefore, it is crucial for governments to take a proactive approach to safeguarding endangered languages and promoting cultural diversity. By doing so, they can ensure the preservation of unique cultural identities and promote a more diverse and enriching global community.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";The allocation of a country's health budget is a critical decision that can have significant impacts on the overall well-being of its citizens. While treatment is essential for addressing existing health issues, I strongly agree that a large proportion of the health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.Investing in health education and preventative measures can have long-term benefits, such as reducing the incidence of diseases and promoting healthy behaviors. By educating the public about healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, the burden on the healthcare system can be significantly reduced. For instance, campaigns to promote vaccination, regular check-ups, and healthy eating habits can prevent illnesses and reduce the need for costly treatments. Moreover, preventative measures such as screenings and early interventions can detect health problems at an early stage, making them easier and less expensive to treat.Furthermore, spending on health education and preventative measures can also have economic benefits. A healthy population is more productive, and reduced healthcare costs can lead to significant savings for individuals, employers, and the government. Additionally, diverting funds to health education and preventative measures can also help to address health inequalities, as disadvantaged communities often have limited access to healthcare services and are more vulnerable to health problems.However, it is essential to strike a balance between treatment and prevention. Diverting too much of the budget from treatment could leave existing health problems unaddressed, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, I believe that allocating a significant proportion of the health budget to health education and preventative measures is a wise investment in the long-term health and well-being of a country's citizens. By prioritizing prevention, countries can create a healthier, more productive, and more sustainable healthcare system.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that university education should be restricted to the very best academic students has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach ensures the quality of higher education, I strongly disagree with this statement. Restricting university education to only the top academic students would have far-reaching consequences, including limiting social mobility and exacerbating inequality.On the one hand, it is true that universities have limited resources and capacity, and prioritizing the most talented students could lead to better academic outcomes. However, this approach overlooks the diverse range of skills and abilities that students bring to the table. Many students who may not excel academically may possess exceptional creative, practical, or entrepreneurial skills that are valuable in their own right.Moreover, restricting university education would perpetuate a cycle of privilege, where only those from affluent backgrounds, who have had access to better schooling and resources, would be able to attend university. This would undermine the principles of meritocracy and social mobility, where individuals can improve their socio-economic status through hard work and dedication. Instead, universities should strive to create a diverse and inclusive environment, where students from all backgrounds can learn and grow together.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of maintaining academic standards, I firmly believe that university education should be accessible to a large proportion of young people, regardless of their academic background. By doing so, we can foster a more equitable and dynamic society, where individuals can develop their unique talents and contribute to the greater good. Ultimately, the benefits of a diverse and inclusive university education system far outweigh the potential drawbacks of restricting access to only the very best academic students.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that ""Parents are the best teachers."" From a young age, children look up to their parents as role models and learn valuable lessons from them. Parents have a unique opportunity to shape their child's morals, values, and behaviors, making them the most effective teachers.One of the primary reasons parents are the best teachers is that they have a deep understanding of their child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. This allows them to tailor their teaching to meet their child's individual needs, providing personalized guidance and support. For instance, a parent may recognize that their child is a visual learner and adapt their teaching methods to incorporate images, diagrams, and videos.Moreover, parents are able to teach their children essential life skills, such as responsibility, hard work, and empathy, through hands-on experience and real-life situations. For example, a parent may teach their child the importance of responsibility by assigning them chores and encouraging them to care for a pet. These lessons are invaluable and cannot be replicated in a traditional classroom setting.Additionally, parents have a profound influence on their child's emotional and social development. They teach their children how to navigate relationships, manage emotions, and develop self-confidence. A parent's unconditional love and support provide a child with a sense of security, allowing them to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them.In conclusion, parents play a vital role in a child's education and development, making them the best teachers. Their ability to provide personalized guidance, teach essential life skills, and influence emotional and social development is unparalleled. As such, I firmly believe that parents are the best teachers, and their impact on a child's life is immeasurable."
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When considering a job offer, the notion that salary is the most important factor is a common perspective. However, I partially disagree with this statement. While a competitive salary is undoubtedly a significant aspect of any job, it is not the sole determining factor for many individuals.On one hand, salary is a crucial consideration, especially in today's economic climate where the cost of living continues to rise. A decent salary ensures that one's basic needs are met and provides a sense of financial security. It also reflects the value that an employer places on an employee's skills and contributions. Moreover, a higher salary can offer better opportunities for savings, personal development, and investment in the future.On the other hand, there are numerous other factors that can outweigh the importance of salary. Job satisfaction, for instance, plays a critical role in an individual's overall well-being and happiness. A job that offers personal fulfillment, opportunities for growth, and a healthy work-life balance can be more appealing than one that merely offers a high salary. Additionally, factors such as company culture, work environment, and the opportunity to make a meaningful impact can significantly influence one's job choice.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it is not the only factor, and its importance can vary greatly from person to person. Other aspects such as personal fulfillment, growth opportunities, and work environment also play significant roles. Ultimately, the most important consideration should be a balance between these factors, ensuring that the job not only provides financial stability but also contributes to an individual's overall quality of life and career satisfaction.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The proposition to increase taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to extremely high levels in order to discourage the use of private cars is a contentious issue. On one hand, I support this idea as it aims to reduce the environmental degradation caused by the burning of oil for transportation. The emissions from private cars contribute significantly to air pollution, climate change, and other environmental problems. By increasing the tax on petrol and diesel, the government can discourage people from using private cars, thereby reducing the harmful emissions and promoting a cleaner environment.On the other hand, I also reject this idea to some extent. While increasing taxation may discourage the use of private cars, it may also impose a significant burden on low-income households who rely on private cars for their daily commute. Moreover, the increased tax revenue may not necessarily be used to improve public transportation, which is a crucial factor in discouraging private car use. If the tax revenue is not invested in alternative modes of transportation, such as buses, trains, and cycling infrastructure, people may not have viable alternatives to private cars, and the policy may not be effective in reducing car use.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of reducing private car use to protect the environment, I believe that increasing taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be implemented in conjunction with investments in public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. This approach would ensure that people have viable alternatives to private cars, making the policy more effective and equitable. Therefore, I partially support the idea, but with the caveat that it should be part of a broader transportation policy that prioritizes sustainability and social equity.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The notion that a police force carrying guns promotes a higher level of violence in society is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that the presence of firearms among law enforcement exacerbates violence, I partially disagree with this opinion.On one hand, carrying guns can indeed lead to a heightened sense of tension and aggression in potentially volatile situations. The visible presence of firearms can escalate conflicts, as individuals may feel threatened or intimidated, leading to a greater likelihood of violent confrontation. Furthermore, the availability of guns can also lead to a culture of reliance on firepower rather than de-escalation techniques, potentially resulting in avoidable tragedies.On the other hand, it is essential to recognize that the primary role of the police is to maintain law and order, and in many situations, the presence of firearms serves as a deterrent to crime. In societies with high crime rates or significant threats to public safety, the absence of guns among police officers could put them at risk and compromise their ability to effectively enforce the law. Additionally, responsible and well-trained police forces can use firearms in a way that minimizes harm and promotes public safety.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that the presence of guns among police can contribute to a higher level of violence under certain circumstances, I do not entirely agree that it is a primary driver of societal violence. It is crucial for police forces to be well-trained in the use of firearms and to prioritize de-escalation techniques to avoid unnecessary violence. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers the specific needs and context of each society is necessary to determine the appropriate role of firearms in law enforcement.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;I strongly agree with the statement that with the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Technology has revolutionized the way we learn, providing students with unparalleled access to a vast array of educational resources.One of the primary reasons technology has enhanced learning is its ability to provide instant access to a wealth of information. The internet, for instance, is a treasure trove of educational content, including e-books, articles, and educational websites. Students can now access study materials, tutorials, and online courses with just a few clicks, making it easier for them to learn new concepts and reinforce their understanding of difficult subjects. For example, online platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera offer a wide range of courses and lectures from top universities worldwide, enabling students to learn from renowned experts in their fields.Another significant advantage of technology in learning is its ability to facilitate interactive and engaging learning experiences. Educational software and apps can present information in an engaging and interactive manner, such as through quizzes, games, and simulations. This not only makes learning more enjoyable but also increases student participation and retention. For instance, language learning apps like Duolingo use gamification and interactive exercises to teach languages, making the learning process both fun and effective.In conclusion, technology has undoubtedly transformed the learning landscape, enabling students to access a vast amount of information and learn at a quicker pace. With its ability to provide instant access to educational resources, facilitate interactive learning, and offer personalized learning experiences, technology is an indispensable tool for modern education. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that its role in enhancing learning outcomes will only continue to grow.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The last hundred years have witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, revolutionizing numerous aspects of human life. While these developments have improved the quality of life for many, the negative consequences cannot be overlooked. In my opinion, I partially agree that technological progress has had adverse effects on people's lives.On the one hand, technological advancements have brought about numerous benefits. The invention of the internet, for instance, has enabled global communication, access to information, and facilitated international trade. Medical breakthroughs have also significantly increased human lifespan and improved healthcare. Furthermore, technological innovations have enhanced transportation, making it faster, cheaper, and more convenient.On the other hand, there are several negative consequences of technological progress. The over-reliance on technology has led to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to the rising obesity rates and other health problems. Additionally, the excessive use of social media has been linked to increased stress levels, decreased attention span, and a sense of isolation. The environmental impact of technological production and disposal is also a pressing concern, with the disposal of electronic waste posing a significant threat to the planet.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the numerous benefits of technological progress, I believe that its negative effects on people's lives should not be ignored. It is crucial for individuals, governments, and corporations to work together to mitigate the adverse consequences of technological advancements. By adopting a balanced approach to technology, we can ensure that its benefits are maximized while minimizing its negative impacts. Ultimately, a responsible and sustainable approach to technological progress is essential for creating a better future for humanity.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The presence of violence in television programs has become a pressing concern in recent years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that there is a large amount of violence in television programs and we should reduce it. Exposure to violent content on television can have severe consequences, particularly on children and young adults. Research has shown that prolonged exposure to violent programs can lead to aggressive behavior, desensitization to violence, and a decrease in empathy.Moreover, the depiction of violence on television can also perpetuate negative stereotypes and glorify violent behavior. This can have a profound impact on societal norms and values, contributing to a culture of violence and aggression. Furthermore, the sheer amount of violence on television can also have a numbing effect, making viewers less responsive to the severity of violent acts and more accepting of them as a normal part of life.Reducing violence on television is not only a moral imperative but also a necessary step towards creating a more compassionate and peaceful society. This can be achieved through stricter regulation of television content, as well as greater awareness and education among viewers about the potential harm caused by violent programming. Additionally, television networks and producers can also play a crucial role by promoting more positive and uplifting content that encourages empathy, kindness, and non-violent conflict resolution.In conclusion, the excessive amount of violence on television is a serious issue that requires immediate attention and action. By reducing violence on television, we can help create a more positive and peaceful media environment that promotes healthy values and behaviors. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that television programming reflects the values of empathy, kindness, and non-violence that are essential for building a better society.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The notion that the presence of guns in a police force contributes to a higher level of violence in society is a contentious issue. While some argue that armed police officers can effectively deter and respond to violent crimes, others believe that it can escalate violence and create a culture of aggression. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement that carrying guns by police encourages higher levels of violence in society.On one hand, it is reasonable to assume that the visibility of guns can lead to a higher likelihood of their use, potentially resulting in more violent outcomes. For instance, in countries where police are armed, there have been reported cases of police brutality and excessive use of force, which can contribute to increased violence and mistrust of law enforcement among the public. Furthermore, the mere presence of guns can create an environment where conflicts are more likely to be resolved through violence rather than de-escalation techniques.On the other hand, I also believe that the relationship between armed police and societal violence is more complex and depends on various factors, including the training and discipline of police officers, as well as the cultural and social context of the community they serve. In some societies, the presence of armed police may be seen as a necessary measure to protect citizens from serious threats, and their use of firearms may be strictly regulated and monitored to prevent abuse. In conclusion, while there may be some correlation between armed police forces and higher levels of violence, it is not a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship. The impact of police carrying guns on societal violence depends on a multitude of factors, including policing practices, community relationships, and societal norms. Therefore, a nuanced approach that considers these complexities is necessary to fully understand this issue.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";I disagree with the statement that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. While classmates can certainly have an impact on a child's academic performance and social development, I believe that parents play a more significant role in shaping their child's success in school.First and foremost, parents are responsible for providing a supportive and nurturing environment that fosters a love of learning and promotes academic achievement. They encourage their children to work hard, persevere, and strive for excellence, values that are essential for success in school. Additionally, parents are often involved in their child's education, attending parent-teacher conferences, helping with homework, and reinforcing what is learned in the classroom.In contrast, while classmates can be a positive influence, they can also be a distraction or a negative influence. For example, if a child is surrounded by classmates who do not value education or who engage in disruptive behavior, it can be challenging for them to stay focused and motivated. Furthermore, parents have a longer-term influence on their child's life, whereas classmates may change from year to year.Moreover, research has shown that parental involvement is a strong predictor of academic achievement. Children whose parents are involved in their education tend to have better attendance, higher grades, and higher levels of academic motivation. In conclusion, while classmates can certainly have an impact on a child's success in school, I believe that parents are a more important influence. They provide a foundation of support, values, and encouragement that is essential for academic achievement and future success.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The notion that living in big cities is detrimental to people's health is a topic of ongoing debate. While there are valid arguments to support this claim, there are also several counterarguments that suggest the relationship between urban living and health is more complex. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement.On the one hand, living in big cities can have negative impacts on both physical and mental health. The high levels of air pollution, noise pollution, and stress associated with urban environments can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders. Furthermore, the fast-paced and often sedentary lifestyle of city dwellers can contribute to obesity and other lifestyle-related health issues. For instance, the lack of green spaces and recreational areas in cities can discourage physical activity, exacerbating the problem.On the other hand, big cities also offer numerous health benefits that are not available in rural areas. For example, cities are typically home to advanced medical facilities, specialized healthcare professionals, and a wide range of health services, making it easier for residents to access quality healthcare. Additionally, urban areas often have a wider range of healthy food options, including organic and specialty stores, which can promote healthier eating habits. Cities also tend to have more opportunities for social interaction, which is crucial for mental health and wellbeing.In conclusion, while living in big cities can pose certain health risks, it is not entirely bad for people's health. The availability of quality healthcare services, diverse food options, and social opportunities can outweigh the negative aspects. However, it is essential for city planners and policymakers to prioritize green spaces, pollution reduction, and initiatives that promote physical activity and mental wellbeing to mitigate the adverse effects of urban living. By doing so, cities can become healthier and more sustainable environments for their inhabitants.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The notion that arming police forces leads to a higher level of violence in society is a contentious issue. While some argue that the presence of guns among law enforcement can escalate situations and promote a culture of violence, I partially agree with this viewpoint.On the one hand, carrying guns can indeed contribute to a more aggressive and confrontational approach to policing. When officers are armed, they may be more likely to resort to firearms in tense situations, potentially leading to increased violence and fatalities. This can create a vicious cycle, where the presence of guns on both sides of the law enforcement-citizen interaction heightens the likelihood of violent outcomes. Furthermore, the visibility of firearms can also contribute to a sense of fear and mistrust among the public, undermining the relationship between law enforcement and the community they serve.On the other hand, it is essential to consider the context and the role that firearms play in maintaining public safety. In many societies, the primary function of arming police is to protect both officers and civilians from serious harm. In situations where there is a genuine threat to life, the availability of firearms can be a necessary tool for law enforcement to effectively manage and resolve the situation without resorting to greater violence. Additionally, the training that officers receive emphasizes de-escalation techniques and the judicious use of force, suggesting that the mere presence of guns does not inherently lead to higher levels of violence.In conclusion, while I agree that arming police forces can potentially contribute to higher levels of violence in certain contexts, it is not an absolute or universal truth. The relationship between armed law enforcement and societal violence is complex and influenced by a myriad of factors including policing culture, community relations, and the specific circumstances of each incident. Therefore, a nuanced and context-sensitive approach is necessary when evaluating the impact of firearms on the level of violence in a society.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;I strongly agree that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Education plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of a nation, as it empowers individuals with knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities. A well-educated population is essential for a country's economic, social, and political growth.Education enables individuals to acquire skills and knowledge that are necessary for securing better-paying jobs, thereby increasing their standard of living and contributing to the country's economic development. Furthermore, education fosters innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological advancements, which are crucial for a country's competitiveness in the global market. Educated individuals are also more likely to participate in the democratic process, make informed decisions, and hold their leaders accountable, thereby promoting good governance and political stability.In addition, education has a positive impact on a country's social development. It promotes social mobility, reduces poverty and inequality, and improves healthcare outcomes. Educated individuals are more likely to adopt healthy behaviors, practice family planning, and seek medical care when needed, thereby reducing mortality rates and improving overall well-being.While other factors such as infrastructure, natural resources, and institutions are also important for a country's development, education is the foundation upon which all other development initiatives are built. Without a skilled and educated workforce, a country's potential for growth and development is severely limited. In conclusion, education is the single most important factor in the development of a country, as it has a multiplier effect on economic, social, and political development, and is essential for building a prosperous, stable, and equitable society. Therefore, governments and policymakers should prioritize education and invest heavily in education infrastructure, teacher training, and student support services to reap the benefits of a highly educated and skilled population.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The notion that celebrities are more renowned for their glamour and wealth than their accomplishments has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that this trend has a detrimental impact on young people, the reality is more complex. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which I agree or disagree with this statement.On the one hand, it is undeniable that the lives of celebrities are often portrayed in a way that emphasizes their luxurious lifestyles and physical appearances. The constant bombardment of images and stories in the media showcasing their wealth and glamour can create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of materialism among young people. This can lead to a misguided sense of what is truly important in life, with some young individuals prioritizing fame and fortune over hard work and achievement.On the other hand, I disagree that this is the sole responsibility of celebrities. The media and the public also play a significant role in perpetuating this culture. Moreover, many celebrities use their platforms to raise awareness for social causes, support charitable organizations, and inspire young people with their talents and achievements. For instance, celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Angelina Jolie are renowned for their philanthropic work and dedication to social and environmental causes.In conclusion, while it is true that some celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth, I believe that this is not the only aspect of their fame. Many celebrities are using their platforms to make a positive impact, and it is up to the media and the public to promote a more balanced view of what it means to be successful. Ultimately, young people should be encouraged to look up to role models who embody a combination of achievement, hard work, and social responsibility.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, and this has sparked a heated debate about the impact of technology on social interaction. While some argue that mobile phones destroy social interaction, I disagree with this notion.On the one hand, mobile phones can indeed detract from face-to-face interactions. People often spend more time interacting with their phones than engaging with others in their physical presence. This can lead to a decline in deep, meaningful conversations and a sense of isolation, even in crowded spaces. Moreover, the rise of social media has created a culture of curated online personas, which can replace genuine human connections.On the other hand, mobile phones have also enabled new forms of social interaction that were previously unimaginable. For instance, social media platforms and messaging apps have made it possible to stay connected with friends and family across geographical distances. Mobile phones have also facilitated the formation of online communities centered around shared interests, allowing people to connect with others who share similar passions and hobbies. Furthermore, mobile phones have enabled people to access a vast array of social resources, including support groups and online counseling services, which can be particularly beneficial for those who struggle with in-person interactions.In conclusion, while mobile phones can have negative effects on social interaction, I believe that their benefits outweigh their drawbacks. By using mobile phones judiciously and being mindful of our online behavior, we can harness the power of technology to augment and enhance our social interactions, rather than replacing them. Ultimately, mobile phones are simply a tool, and it is up to us to use them in a way that promotes meaningful connections and community building.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The notion that ordinary people have little impact on mitigating environmental problems has sparked a heated debate. While it is true that governments and large companies have a significant role to play in reducing environmental damage, the idea that individual actions are insignificant is a misconception. I partially disagree with the statement, citing the collective power of individual actions and the need for a multi-faceted approach to environmental conservation.On one hand, governments and large corporations do bear a substantial responsibility for reducing environmental harm. They have the resources, the infrastructure, and the regulatory power to implement large-scale changes that can significantly reduce pollution, environmental degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, governments can enforce stricter environmental regulations, and companies can adopt sustainable practices and technologies. Their actions can have a profound impact on the environment, setting standards and influencing consumer behavior.On the other hand, the cumulative effect of individual actions should not be underestimated. Simple actions such as reducing energy consumption, recycling, using public transport, or buying sustainable products may seem insignificant on their own, but when practiced by millions, they can lead to substantial positive change. Moreover, individual actions can influence broader societal attitudes towards the environment, promoting a culture of sustainability and pushing for policy changes through public demand.In conclusion, while governments and large companies are pivotal in the fight against environmental degradation, the role of ordinary people should not be downplayed. It is through a combination of policy changes, corporate responsibility, and individual actions that we can effectively tackle the environmental challenges facing our world today. Therefore, a collaborative approach involving all sectors of society is necessary to mitigate the scale and complexity of environmental problems.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The statement that detailed descriptions of crimes in newspapers and on TV can have negative consequences on society and should therefore be restricted, is a topic of ongoing debate. While I understand the intention behind this statement, I partially disagree with it.On the one hand, detailed descriptions of crimes can indeed have detrimental effects on society. For instance, they can cause unnecessary fear and anxiety among the public, especially if the crimes are violent or shocking. Moreover, such descriptions can also inspire copycat crimes or provoke vulnerable individuals to engage in similar criminal behavior. Additionally, the families and victims of the crimes may suffer further distress and trauma from the explicit coverage.On the other hand, restricting this kind of information on media can undermine the principles of freedom of press and public's right to know. The media plays a crucial role in informing the public about important issues, including crime, which can lead to greater awareness and potentially prevent future crimes. Detailed descriptions can also serve as a deterrent, as they can highlight the severe consequences of criminal actions. Furthermore, media coverage can put pressure on authorities to take action and improve their response to crime.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential negative consequences of detailed crime descriptions in the media, I do not entirely agree that such information should be restricted. Instead, I believe that a balance should be struck between informing the public and protecting vulnerable individuals. Media outlets should exercise responsibility and sensitivity in their reporting, avoiding gratuitous or exploitative content. Ultimately, it is the media's duty to report the news in a way that is both informative and respectful, minimizing harm while maintaining the public's right to information.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;The notion that teaching children handwriting skills is unnecessary in the modern age has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that technology has rendered handwriting obsolete, I disagree with this sentiment. Handwriting remains an essential skill that offers numerous benefits for children's cognitive, academic, and personal development.First and foremost, handwriting enhances literacy skills, such as reading and writing comprehension. Studies have shown that children who practice handwriting exhibit better retention and understanding of written material. Furthermore, handwriting is closely linked to brain development, particularly in areas responsible for language and memory. By practicing handwriting, children strengthen their fine motor skills, which can improve overall dexterity and coordination.Moreover, handwriting promotes creativity, self-expression, and individuality. In an era dominated by digital communication, handwriting provides a unique outlet for personal expression, allowing children to convey their thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a distinctive and meaningful way. Additionally, handwritten work is often perceived as more authentic and valuable, as it reflects the writer's personality and effort.While it is true that technology has become an integral part of modern life, and typing skills are undoubtedly important, it is premature to dismiss the value of handwriting entirely. In fact, many professions, such as art, design, and education, still rely heavily on handwriting and hand-drawn illustrations. Moreover, in situations where technology is unavailable or unreliable, handwriting remains a vital means of communication.In conclusion, I firmly believe that teaching children handwriting skills remains essential in the modern age. The benefits of handwriting, ranging from improved literacy and cognitive development to enhanced creativity and self-expression, make it an invaluable skill that should continue to be taught and nurtured in schools. By doing so, we can ensure that children develop into well-rounded, capable, and expressive individuals, equipped to succeed in all aspects of life.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The notion that families who send their children to private schools should be exempt from paying taxes that support the state education system is a contentious issue. While some argue that it is unfair to compel these families to contribute financially to a system they do not utilize, others contend that education is a public good that benefits society as a whole, and therefore, everyone should contribute to its funding.I disagree with the statement to a large extent. The primary reason for this stance is that the state education system benefits not just the individuals who use it, but society at large. A well-educated population contributes to economic growth, social cohesion, and civic engagement, among other benefits. By supporting the state education system, taxpayers are investing in the future of their community, regardless of whether they have children in the system or not. Furthermore, public schools play a critical role in providing education to those who cannot afford private schooling, thereby helping to reduce inequality and promote social mobility.Additionally, the idea of exempting private school families from contributing to the state education system could lead to a two-tiered system, where those who can afford private education opt out of supporting public education, potentially undermining the quality and availability of public schools. This could exacerbate existing inequalities in education and society.In conclusion, while the argument for exempting private school families from taxes supporting the state education system may seem logical from an individual perspective, considering the broader societal benefits of public education, it is reasonable to expect all taxpayers to contribute to the system. This ensures that public education remains a robust and inclusive system that benefits the entire community.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;I disagree with the statement that government investment in the arts is a waste of money. While it is true that public services are essential and require significant funding, the arts play a vital role in the social, cultural, and economic development of a country. Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, can have numerous benefits, including promoting cultural diversity, preserving national heritage, and fostering creativity and innovation.Moreover, the arts industry is a significant contributor to the economy, generating revenue and creating jobs. According to various studies, every dollar invested in the arts can generate multiple times its value in economic activity. Furthermore, the arts have a positive impact on tourism, with many visitors attracted to a country or city specifically to experience its cultural events and performances.Investing in public services is crucial, but it is not a zero-sum game where one sector must be prioritized over another. In fact, a balanced approach that allocates funds to both public services and the arts can lead to a more holistic and sustainable development of a society. The arts can also complement public services, such as education and healthcare, by providing therapeutic and educational benefits.In conclusion, while public services are essential, government investment in the arts is not a waste of money. The arts make a significant contribution to the economy, promote cultural diversity, and have a positive impact on society. Rather than pitting public services against the arts, governments should strive to find a balance that allows for investment in both, leading to a more vibrant, diverse, and prosperous society. By doing so, governments can ensure that their citizens have access to a wide range of cultural, social, and economic opportunities.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The notion that technological advancements and traditional cultures are mutually exclusive has sparked intense debate. While some argue that the inevitable march of technology will erase traditional cultures, it is not entirely accurate to assume that these two entities cannot coexist.On the one hand, technological advancements can indeed pose a threat to traditional cultures. As people increasingly rely on digital platforms for entertainment, education, and socialization, there is a risk that unique cultural practices, traditions, and customs may be forgotten or abandoned. For instance, the widespread use of social media has led to a decline in traditional storytelling and folk music in some communities. Moreover, the homogenization of global culture, fueled by technological connectivity, can result in the loss of distinct cultural identities.On the other hand, technology can also be a powerful tool for preserving and promoting traditional cultures. Digital archives, online museums, and social media platforms can provide a global audience with access to cultural heritage that was previously inaccessible. Additionally, technology can facilitate the revival of endangered languages, customs, and traditions by connecting people across geographical boundaries and enabling the sharing of knowledge and ideas. For example, language learning apps and online courses can help preserve indigenous languages and cultural practices.In conclusion, while technological advancements may pose some challenges to traditional cultures, it is not inevitable that they will be lost. With careful planning, cultural sensitivity, and innovative thinking, technology can be harnessed to support and celebrate traditional cultures, rather than erasing them. Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure that the benefits of technological progress are balanced with the need to preserve our rich cultural diversity. By embracing this balance, we can create a future where tradition and technology coexist and enrich each other.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The notion that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject has sparked intense debate. While the idea of promoting gender equality is commendable, the implementation of such a policy is complex and may not be entirely practical. In my opinion, I partially disagree with this proposition.On one hand, accepting equal numbers of male and female students can help bridge the gap in traditionally male-dominated fields such as engineering and physics. This can lead to a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, which can foster innovative ideas and perspectives. Moreover, it can also empower women to pursue careers in fields where they have been underrepresented, thereby promoting gender equality.On the other hand, enforcing a strict equal quota system may lead to discrimination against qualified applicants based on their gender rather than their academic merit. This can result in less capable students being accepted over more qualified ones simply to meet the quota, which can undermine the academic integrity of the institution. Furthermore, subjects like nursing and education have historically been female-dominated, and imposing a quota system may unfairly restrict opportunities for women in these fields.In conclusion, while the idea of promoting gender equality in university admissions is laudable, a blanket policy of accepting equal numbers of male and female students may not be the most effective or fair approach. A more nuanced strategy that takes into account the specific needs and requirements of each subject and institution would be more appropriate, ensuring that academic merit remains the primary consideration in the admissions process.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The impact of media coverage of celebrities on children has been a topic of concern in recent years. Many people believe that the extensive coverage of celebrities' lives is having a negative effect on children, and I agree with this opinion to a significant extent.On the one hand, the constant exposure to celebrity gossip, and scandals can create unrealistic expectations and promote materialistic values among children. Young minds are impressionable, and they often look up to celebrities as role models. When they see their idols engaging in questionable behavior, they may feel pressured to emulate them, leading to a decline in moral values. Furthermore, the emphasis on physical appearance and wealth in celebrity culture can contribute to low self-esteem and body image issues in children.On the other hand, some may argue that celebrity coverage can have a positive impact on children, as it can inspire them to pursue their passions and interests. For instance, celebrities who use their platform to raise awareness about social causes can motivate children to get involved in philanthropy. However, I believe that the negative effects of celebrity coverage outweigh the positive ones.In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to celebrity coverage, I strongly agree that the negative effects of media coverage of celebrities on children are significant. Parents, educators, and the media itself must work together to promote a more balanced and positive representation of celebrities and their values, and to educate children about the potential pitfalls of celebrity culture. By doing so, we can help children develop a healthy and realistic understanding of the world around them. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that children are not unduly influenced by the often superficial and materialistic world of celebrity culture.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The statement ""Prevention is better than cure"" suggests that a significant portion of a country's health budget should be allocated to health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. I largely agree with this assertion, as investing in prevention can have long-term benefits for individuals and the healthcare system as a whole.Preventative measures, as well as health education, can significantly reduce the incidence of diseases, thereby decreasing the need for costly treatments. For instance, vaccination programs and public health campaigns can prevent the spread of infectious diseases, while educational initiatives can promote healthy lifestyles and habits, reducing the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes. By diverting funds to these areas, healthcare systems can avoid the high costs associated with treating advanced stages of disease.Moreover, prevention can improve the overall quality of life for individuals and communities. By investing in health education, people can make informed decisions about their health, enabling them to take proactive steps to prevent illnesses. This, in turn, can lead to a more productive and healthy workforce, contributing to the economic growth of a country.However, it is also crucial to maintain a balance between prevention and treatment. Completely diverting funds from treatment to prevention could have detrimental effects on those already suffering from illnesses, who still require access to effective treatments and care. Thus, a balanced approach that allocates funds to both prevention and treatment, ensuring that current healthcare needs are met while also investing in the future health of the population, is essential.In conclusion, while there is a need for a balanced approach, I agree that a large proportion of a country's health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. This strategy can lead to significant reductions in disease incidence, improved quality of life, and ultimately, a more sustainable healthcare system."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;The notion that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies, and subsequently raising them, is a deeply ingrained stereotype in many societies. However, this idea is not only outdated but also unfair. Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood, as the responsibility of raising children is a shared one between both parents. In today's modern world, the traditional nuclear family structure has undergone significant changes. With more women pursuing careers and financial independence, it is no longer feasible for them to bear the sole responsibility of childcare. Moreover, research has shown that active involvement of fathers in childcare has a profoundly positive impact on the cognitive, emotional, and social development of children. Emphasizing fatherhood as much as motherhood not only promotes equality but also recognizes the vital role that fathers play in the upbringing of their children. It encourages fathers to take a more active role in childcare, sharing the responsibilities with mothers and fostering a more balanced and equitable distribution of parental duties. Furthermore, emphasizing fatherhood helps to break down stereotypes and challenge societal norms that have traditionally viewed childcare as the domain of women. By acknowledging and promoting the importance of fatherhood, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for families, where both parents can contribute equally to the raising of their children. In conclusion, the idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies and raising them is a misconception that needs to be addressed. By emphasizing fatherhood as much as motherhood, we can promote a more balanced and equitable approach to parenting.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;I strongly disagree with the statement that time spent playing sports is time wasted and that children should solely focus on studying hard at school. While academic achievement is crucial for a child's future, physical education and sports play a vital role in their overall development.Playing sports not only improves physical health and fitness, but also enhances mental well-being, teamwork skills, and discipline. It teaches children valuable life skills such as perseverance, hard work, and how to cope with success and failure. Moreover, sports can help children develop their social skills, build friendships, and learn how to work towards a common goal. These essential life skills are just as important as academic knowledge and can have a lasting impact on a child's future.Furthermore, research has shown that physical activity can actually improve cognitive function and academic performance. Exercise has been proven to boost concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills, all of which are essential for academic success. Therefore, it is not a case of either studying hard or playing sports, but rather a balance between the two.In conclusion, while studying hard at school is important, it is not the only factor that contributes to a child's development. Playing sports is a valuable use of time, teaching children essential life skills, improving their physical and mental health, and even enhancing their academic performance. A balanced approach that incorporates both academic study and physical activity is the key to raising well-rounded, healthy, and successful individuals.
