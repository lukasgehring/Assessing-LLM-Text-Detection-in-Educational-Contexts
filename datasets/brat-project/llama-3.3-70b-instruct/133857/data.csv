0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;It is often stated that competition is a driving force behind economic growth, as companies strive to improve their products and services to stay ahead in the market, ultimately benefiting society as a whole. However, when considering the impact of competition versus cooperation on personal development, the focus shifts from societal prosperity to individual growth. From this perspective, I strongly advocate for the importance of cooperation during primary education.Primarily, cooperation enables children to acquire essential interpersonal skills that are crucial throughout their lives. Through teamwork, students learn not only how to work towards a common goal with others but also how to interact effectively with their peers. The process of cooperation teaches children valuable skills such as active listening, effective communication, comprehensive thinking, and conflict resolution through compromise. These skills foster positive relationships and are beneficial for a lifetime.On the other hand, competition is often seen as a means to achieve excellence and gain victory. It is believed to make society more efficient. However, when examining the path to success in competitive environments, it becomes apparent that cooperation plays a vital role. The more ambitious the goal, the more cooperation is needed. For instance, in the competitive arena of the Olympic Games, it is unimaginable for an athlete to succeed without the support of their coach, diet specialists, and medical staff. While the athlete may be the one standing on the podium, the victory is a testament to the teamwork and cooperation that made it possible. Therefore, cooperation is a necessary component of achieving success in competitive endeavors.In conclusion, whether considering individual development or the interplay between competition and cooperation, the same conclusion can be drawn: adopting a more cooperative attitude towards life is more conducive to personal success. By emphasizing cooperation, especially during primary education, we set the stage for individuals to develop the skills necessary not only to thrive in competitive environments but to build strong, lasting relationships and achieve their goals through collaborative efforts.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;Over the past 50 years, there has been a significant increase in immigration to other countries. People have moved abroad for various reasons, including access to better education and higher-paying jobs. While some believe that adopting local customs is essential to integrate into their new country's culture, I strongly argue that maintaining one's cultural identity is not only possible but also crucial.Firstly, preserving one's cultural identity is essential for individuals to thrive in multicultural environments. For instance, Australia's Multicultural Day is a prime example, where immigrants from diverse nations come together to showcase their traditional food, music, and activities in public venues. This event attracts many Australians who come to learn about and appreciate the different cultures, fostering a sense of pride and mutual understanding among attendees. This highlights the importance of sustaining immigrant cultural values.Secondly, maintaining one's cultural identity is vital for establishing a connection to one's country of origin and passing on cultural heritage to future generations. For example, children who immigrate to a new country may face social challenges in school, making it essential for parents to create a familiar environment by connecting with others from their home country. This helps children socialize comfortably and feel at home, reducing the risk of feelings of isolation, which can lead to social disorders. Therefore, preserving cultural traditions in the host country is extremely important.In conclusion, although some argue that abandoning one's cultural values is necessary to adapt to a new culture, I firmly believe that sustaining cultural traditions enables immigrants to maintain their cultural identity and confidence in a multicultural society. By preserving their cultural heritage, immigrants can navigate their new environment with ease and pride, ultimately enriching the cultural diversity of their adopted country.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;Over the past decade, there has been a significant surge in international tourism, with travelers flocking to experience the world's most breathtaking natural wonders, ancient heritage sites, and diverse cultural landscapes. Although some may argue that this trend has detrimental effects on the host countries, I firmly believe that it has played a vital role in driving economic growth, preserving cultural heritage, and protecting the environment.First and foremost, international tourism has been a catalyst for economic development in destination countries, as it creates a demand for various services and infrastructure. For instance, the influx of tourists visiting Cambodia's iconic Angkor Wat temple has spurred the growth of related businesses, such as restaurants, hotels, and souvenir shops, in the surrounding areas. This, in turn, has generated numerous job opportunities for locals, improved infrastructure, and enhanced living standards. Consequently, tourism has had a profoundly positive impact on the lives of people in tourist destinations.Furthermore, the tourism industry has been instrumental in preserving cultural values and protecting natural environments. In Vietnam, for example, the tourism ministry has provided funding and support to preserve cultural treasures, such as the traditional 'Trong Dong' drum performance, and stunning natural landscapes, like Ha Long Bay. Without the financial backing and revenue generated by tourism, many of these intangible cultural assets and breathtaking scenery would be at risk of disappearing due to lack of funding. Thus, tourism has helped to safeguard these invaluable cultural and environmental treasures.In conclusion, from my perspective, international tourism has made significant contributions to both economic development and the preservation of cultural and environmental values in tourist destinations. Moreover, authorities should continue to support and foster these sustainable developments, ensuring that the benefits of tourism are equitably distributed and its positive impacts are long-lasting.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;Over the past 50 years, there has been a substantial rise in global tourism. While some people may view tourism as a lucrative industry that generates significant profits for destination countries, I argue that it has had a detrimental impact on the cultural heritage and natural environment of tourist destinations.Firstly, it is undeniable that an influx of tourists from diverse cultural backgrounds can lead to changes in the cultural identity of host countries. Thailand, for instance, experienced a significant influx of American soldiers during the Vietnam War, who engaged in activities such as sex tourism and drug use. This created a high demand for related services, prompting local businesses to capitalize on the opportunity, often through illicit means, including the exploitation of underage individuals. The lack of effective regulation by authorities contributed to a negative perception of Thailand's tourism industry. This example illustrates the potential for international tourism to have adverse effects on destination countries.Secondly, there is clear evidence that tourism is increasingly harming the natural habitats of popular tourist destinations. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which attracts over a billion visitors annually, has suffered immense destruction. The coral reefs have been damaged by human activities such as walking on the reefs, dropping anchors, and pollution from fuel and other sources. As a result, many marine species are now endangered, and parts of the reef have become uninhabitable. This highlights the significant threat that tourism poses to natural environments.In conclusion, I firmly believe that tourism exerts considerable pressure on both the socio-cultural and natural environments. If authorities fail to take measures to conserve these valuable assets, they will be irreparably damaged in the near future. It is essential for governments and stakeholders to implement sustainable tourism practices to mitigate the negative impacts and ensure the long-term preservation of these precious resources.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;Every student aspires to attend a reputable university and immerse themselves in a new environment. To achieve this, some students opt to study abroad, while others prefer to remain in their home country due to the challenges associated with overseas living and studying. In my opinion, studying overseas offers numerous benefits, as it equips individuals with a wide range of skills for several key reasons.Firstly, attending a university abroad provides students with the opportunity to enhance their social skills by engaging with peers from diverse cultural backgrounds. Compared to those who study in their home country, international students are more likely to develop the adaptability necessary to thrive in new environments and situations. This, in turn, enables them to become more resilient and better equipped to handle the challenges of an increasingly globalized world.Secondly, the experience of living and studying overseas is unparalleled when it comes to learning self-sufficiency. Although international students may struggle with feelings of loneliness and homesickness, these difficulties ultimately give rise to invaluable life experiences. By navigating the challenges of independence, students learn to rely solely on themselves, fostering a sense of autonomy and self-reliance.Furthermore, employers often seek candidates with international experience and language skills. Succeeding in overseas studies provides students with a competitive edge in the job market, rendering them more eligible for employment opportunities compared to their peers. This, in itself, is a significant advantage, as it opens doors to a broader range of career prospects.In conclusion, while studying and living overseas undoubtedly presents numerous difficulties, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. The experience offers a unique perspective on both academic subjects and life in general, ultimately enriching the individual's understanding of the world and their place within it.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;Studying abroad has become a common practice among students, driven by a variety of motivations. In my opinion, this experience offers numerous benefits, providing personal, academic, and cultural growth.Initially, living in a foreign country allows students to acquire invaluable life experience. Adapting to a new environment demands flexibility and resilience, as students encounter various challenges in their host country. Overcoming these obstacles fosters maturity and self-reliance, essential life skills. By navigating unfamiliar situations, students learn to become more independent and resourceful.Another significant aspect of studying abroad is the unique academic experience it provides. Students are exposed to different educational systems, instructors, and peers, which diverges from their home country's academic setting. This diversity enriches their learning experience, offering fresh perspectives and approaches to academics.The cultural dimension of studying abroad is equally important. Immersing themselves in a foreign culture, students gain insight into the customs, traditions, and ways of thinking of the host country's people. This cross-cultural exchange broadens their understanding of the world, making them more receptive to diverse ideas and perspectives. Furthermore, it educates them about the complexities of the global community they live in, promoting openness and acceptance.In conclusion, studying abroad is a transformative experience that not only offers advantages but also profoundly impacts various aspects of one's life. It has the potential to shape students in a profoundly positive way, influencing their personal growth, academic pursuits, and cultural awareness.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The internet has gained immense popularity in recent years, offering an vast array of information to the public. Consequently, print media, such as newspapers, have seen a significant drop in readership. While some individuals believe that newspapers can endure for an extended period, others argue that they have lost their competitive edge, making it challenging for them to sustain themselves in the long run. Personally, I tend to agree with the latter viewpoint, and here's why.Firstly, accessing information through the internet is faster and more convenient than reading newspapers. Unlike the past, when people had to wait for hours to get their daily newspaper, today they can access the latest news, updated every second, through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, anytime and anywhere. With the widespread availability of these devices worldwide, it's become easier for people to access a vast amount of information that newspapers cannot provide within their limited pages. Therefore, print media has failed to maintain its crucial role in providing information.Another significant point is that, from an economic perspective, buying newspapers seems like a waste of money when the internet is readily available to everyone. It's evident that internet services are often provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. This raises the question of whether it's rational for someone to spend extra money on newspapers to receive similar, if not less, information than what they can get from the internet. The likely answer is that few rational people would do so. Consequently, the number of people reading newspapers may continue to decline sharply, potentially leading to the shutdown of many newspapers in the near future.Lastly, when considering the environmental impact, it's essential to recognize that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down, contributing to deforestation, a pressing global issue. At this point, the production of newspapers will have to confront environmental concerns, making it even more challenging for them to survive.In conclusion, while it may be unfortunate for newspaper advocates to witness the decline of this type of media, it's essential to view this as a natural consequence of the continuous innovations in media technology and our modern life as a whole. The rise of the internet and other digital platforms has fundamentally altered the way we consume information, making it increasingly difficult for traditional print media to remain relevant.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";"As Senator Bernie Sanders once noted, ""Education is the investment in our future."" Indeed, education plays a vital role in fostering a civilized society and ensuring a country's long-term prosperity. Governments around the world recognize its importance and prioritize education development. The two essential components of the education system - elementary and advanced education - require sufficient government funding to thrive.Elementary education, being the foundation of a person's development, is a fundamental requirement for becoming a qualified citizen in today's society. Therefore, governments must guarantee equal and accessible elementary education for all. A lack of well-established primary education is often accompanied by high illiteracy rates, which can severely hinder a country's future progress. For developing countries aiming to accelerate their growth, investing in elementary education to cultivate qualified future citizens is a top priority.However, focusing solely on elementary education is insufficient. Higher education, representing the pinnacle of a country's academic achievements, drives economic and social advancement. By applying cutting-edge technologies and innovative ideas, higher education can lead a country to prosperity and elevate its international standing. While some argue that universities can sustain themselves through donations or inventions, this argument is flawed. Research in humanities and arts requires substantial funding, and government investment in universities can attract top talent and enhance a country's global reputation.In conclusion, it is clear that governments should prioritize both elementary education and higher education, as both are crucial for building a brighter future. By investing in young children's education and universities, governments can pave the way for a prosperous and enlightened society."
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";The significance of having good roommates and their impact on our university life cannot be overstated. Research has shown that friendships formed during this period are likely to be lifelong, and this is particularly true for roommates. In my opinion, the most crucial quality of a good roommate is consideration, closely followed by effective communication. Consideration is vital in any relationship, as it fosters a harmonious living environment. For instance, a considerate roommate would lower the volume of music or television at night, showing respect for their roommate's need for rest. Often, we only appreciate the value of considerate actions when we experience the negative consequences of thoughtless behavior. By prioritizing the feelings of others before taking any self-centered action, we can significantly enhance our relationship with our roommates. Therefore, having a considerate roommate is essential for a smooth and enjoyable university experience, as it prevents conflicts and can lead to lasting friendships or even familial bonds.Effective communication is equally important for being a good roommate. People have diverse daily habits, such as tidying up in the morning, which can be perceived differently by different individuals. Some might view tidying as a trivial task, while others might see it as a significant chore. If minor issues like these lead to conflicts, it might be a case of making a mountain out of a molehill. Therefore, communication plays a critical role in clarifying misunderstandings and building bonds between roommates. Through open dialogue, we can gain a better understanding of each other's preferences and habits, leading to a more harmonious living situation.In conclusion, there are numerous valuable factors that contribute to a positive roommate experience. In my view, consideration and communication stand out as the most important qualities. However, it's unrealistic to expect to find a roommate who ticks all the boxes. Given the diversity of personalities, flexibility and adaptability are key to navigating different living situations and contributing to a harmonious society.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;In recent years, transportation has become a pressing social concern, sparking intense debate about whether governments should prioritize investing in traffic infrastructure or developing public transportation systems. Investing in buses, trains, and subways appears to be a reasonable approach, as these modes of transportation serve a large segment of the population, thereby reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Both of these outcomes are crucial for the well-being of society.The reduction of carbon emissions is particularly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The correlation between the number of cars and motorbikes on the road and the damage to the ozone layer is undeniable. If governments allocate more funds to improve roads, it is likely that more people will opt to drive their private vehicles, resulting in increased carbon emissions and contributing to skin cancer and environmental degradation. In contrast, a well-developed public transportation system would encourage people to use fewer private vehicles, thereby decreasing carbon emissions. Clearly, investing in public transportation has a positive impact on the environment.Furthermore, this approach would also play a vital role in alleviating traffic congestion, a pervasive problem in many major cities. The primary cause of this issue is the sheer volume of vehicles on the roads. To address this problem, governments must incentivize the use of public transportation to reduce the number of cars and motorbikes. Improving roads and highways may not effectively address the root cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, while high-quality roads and highways do facilitate mobility, public transportation systems offer more significant advantages, including the reduction of traffic congestion and protection of the atmosphere. This is why many governments worldwide are investing heavily in developing public transportation infrastructure, recognizing its importance for the well-being of both their citizens and the environment.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";"While some people argue that the majority of the school schedule should focus solely on academics, I firmly believe that physical education should not be overlooked. Physical exercises play a crucial role in creating a healthy nation, facilitating learning through hands-on experience, and ultimately contributing to a country's financial development.The ancient Latin proverb ""Anima sana in corpore sano"" emphasizes the importance of a healthy body as the foundation for a healthy mind. There is a direct correlation between people's health and their frequency of physical activity. Regular exercise improves our overall well-being, and consistent physical activity can gradually lead to better health conditions. If an entire nation, starting from a young age, engages in sports and physical activities daily, it can lay the groundwork for a healthy nation.Moreover, participating in outdoor and indoor sports clarifies many concepts. For instance, regular jogging helps individuals understand their body through direct observation. Similarly, a school basketball team gains practical knowledge about techniques and strategies through practice, rather than just theoretical learning. Many groundbreaking discoveries in natural sciences have been made through direct observation, which is an integral part of physical education.Lastly, a region's financial sustainability largely depends on the health of its population. Investing in physical education programs can reduce healthcare expenditures, as a healthier nation requires less medical attention. Physically fit individuals can contribute more to both economic and social development. The better a person feels, the more efficiently their brain functions. Incorporating physical activities into early human development can ultimately lead to a mentally healthy society, which in turn, contributes to a financially competitive country.In conclusion, I believe that giving more attention to physical education can have a significant impact on academic success. By prioritizing physical education, we can reap numerous benefits that extend beyond the classroom, ultimately leading to a healthier, more productive, and financially stable society."
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The impact of technology on our daily lives is undeniable, particularly in the realms of transportation and communication, as evidenced by advancements such as airplanes and telephones. There are numerous other effects of technological growth on these areas, which will be outlined below.Primarily, email stands out as one of the most beneficial outcomes of modern technology. Historically, sending letters was a costly endeavor, with fees determined by the weight of the correspondence, and the risk of loss or damage was ever-present. However, with the advent of the internet, everyone can now utilize email for free, sending messages instantly to anyone, and even receive confirmation of delivery.Another significant technological advancement is in the realm of financial transactions. The process of applying to foreign universities has become substantially easier for students. Beyond the convenience of email, the use of credit cards enables the online payment of necessary fees, making it possible to accomplish many tasks from the comfort of one's own home.Furthermore, technological innovations in medical equipment have profoundly impacted global health. Biomedical engineers have significantly contributed to the increase in life expectancy worldwide. For instance, their development of artificial heart valves marks a pivotal point in heart surgery. Previously, surgeons used pig heart valves for implants, which limited the patient's survival to approximately three years post-operation. In contrast, current artificial heart valves, engineered by biomedical experts, function effectively and can be easily implanted by doctors.In conclusion, technology has played a pivotal role in enhancing the comfort and quality of our lives. Its influence is evident across various sectors, including transportation, communication, medicine, and more, underscoring its profound impact on modern society.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The rapid evolution of human society is driven by technological advancements. Many things that were once deemed impossible have now become a reality, thanks to advanced technology. For instance, people can now communicate with anyone, anytime, and even see someone from overseas on a computer screen, all made possible by cellphones and the internet. However, some argue that technology has stifled children's creativity. While I acknowledge that technology may have some negative effects on children, I firmly believe that it actually fosters creativity in them.Firstly, technology sparks children's imagination and inspires them to create new things. Children are naturally curious, and when they encounter high-tech products like cellphones, they become fascinated by their functions and eager to understand how they work. A notable example is Bill Gates, who was captivated by the first massive computers and spent all his time figuring out their mechanics. After grasping their workings, he went on to develop a user-friendly and portable computer. Thus, instead of hindering children's creativity, technology encourages them to learn and innovate.Secondly, technology broadens children's knowledge and exposes them to diverse perspectives. In the past, children's understanding of the world was limited to a single viewpoint. However, with advanced technology, they can now access information from foreign countries and interact with friends from different cultural backgrounds. This enables them to learn about various cultures and ways of thinking, which serves as the foundation for creativity. The diverse knowledge gained from around the world inspires children and motivates them to create novel things.Although it is true that technology may have some adverse effects on children, such as making life too comfortable and discouraging them from striving for change, the benefits of technology far outweigh the drawbacks. In fact, many young people are becoming increasingly obsessed with high-tech products, driving them to research and develop new technologies from a very young age, ultimately achieving success.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;Over the past fifty years, the pace of change in human life has exceeded our most extravagant expectations. The influx of new technological devices, such as the internet, television, and cell phones, has revolutionized our daily lives. These innovations have greatly enhanced our experiences, with many students now relying on the internet to supplement their learning after class, finding it to be a highly useful resource.However, many people believe that students in schools and universities still derive the most benefit from traditional lessons with teachers. Teachers play a pivotal role in educating students, starting from the fundamentals of reading, writing, and arithmetic in kindergarten, and progressing to more advanced skills like computer literacy and refined writing techniques in primary school. Teachers also provide crucial support in overcoming academic obstacles. Moreover, they facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and the distinction between right and wrong, serving as guides for students.On the other hand, proponents of the view that students learn more from alternative sources, such as the internet and television, argue that these platforms offer a vast array of learning opportunities that may not be available in a classroom setting. With the ease of accessing information online by simply typing in keywords and searching, students can tap into a limitless pool of articles and websites. This ease of access makes learning more accessible. Additionally, they point out that certain television programs, like those found on the Discovery Channel, are highly instructive, offering insights into diverse cultures, outer space, and more.Personally, I am inclined to believe that students derive more benefit from their teachers than from any other source. This is because teachers not only impart knowledge but also teach critical skills, such as discerning right from wrong. Without the ability to critically evaluate sources and determine their credibility, a student would be at a loss in navigating the vast and often misleading information available online and elsewhere, which is essential for acquiring accurate and useful knowledge.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has revolutionized the way people communicate, leading to a significant shift in the role of written language. Some individuals believe that these modern forms of communication are eroding the importance of written language, and I concur with this view due to their numerous benefits and the evident impact they have on our daily lives.One of the primary advantages of email and text messaging is the ease and convenience they offer. Unlike traditional methods of communication, such as in-person meetings, letter writing, or landline phone calls, which were often hindered by factors like expense, difficulty, and information loss, email and mobile phones have bridged these gaps. With email and text messaging, people can send and receive messages from anywhere, at any time, and can even transmit large amounts of information to multiple recipients simultaneously, all while incurring minimal costs and time.The widespread adoption of email and text messaging has, as a consequence, contributed to the decline of written language's stature. The tendency to use slang, abbreviations, and shortcuts to expedite communication has altered the original form of written language. In some instances, messages are composed solely of emoticons, eliminating the need for written text altogether. Furthermore, the incorporation of these new language forms into academic settings, such as in writing assignments, poses a significant threat to the traditional written language. If this trend persists, written language may face a legitimate crisis regarding its relevance and importance.In conclusion, it is imperative to acknowledge the potential threat that email and text messaging pose to the status of written language, given their undeniable popularity. However, it is equally important for educators, individuals, and particularly the younger generation to be mindful of this issue, ensuring that we can harness the benefits of these new communication tools while preserving the integrity and value of traditional written language.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";As the standard of living continues to improve, the number of animal experiments being conducted has increased, particularly in the development of new medicines and foods. While some argue that this practice is cruel to animals and harmful to nature, I firmly believe that it is essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products for human consumption. Without animal testing, the risks to human health would be substantial. In this essay, I will examine this issue from two perspectives.On one hand, animals play a vital role in maintaining the balance of nature, and their disappearance could have devastating consequences for the environment and human existence. The use of animals in experiments contributes to the decline of certain species, posing a threat to the future of humanity and subsequent generations.On the other hand, despite the negative impact of animal experiments on the natural balance, they are necessary to guarantee human well-being and longevity. It is undeniable that new foods and medicines can be harmful, and scientists must take precautions to ensure that these products benefit people rather than causing them harm or even death. The primary purpose of these experiments is to enhance human life quality and quantity. Moreover, human volunteers cannot replace animals in testing new products, as it would pose significant risks to their health. Additionally, untested products could have potentially harmful effects on human health.In conclusion, while acknowledging the drawbacks of animal experiments, I reaffirm that the benefits of this practice outweigh the drawbacks. The merits of animal testing in ensuring the safety and efficacy of new medicines and foods for human consumption justify its continuation, despite the ethical concerns surrounding animal welfare.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;The presence of television in homes is ubiquitous, and the number of channels and programs available is increasing exponentially. However, many individuals lack a plan to regulate their viewing habits, leading to excessive screen time. I concur with the notion that television can have a detrimental impact on family relationships.Watching television can be a significant time drain. The constant emergence of new channels and shows can be overwhelming, and tracking them can lead to a substantial waste of time. By the end of the day, we often realize that it's too late to engage in other activities, leaving no time for meaningful interactions with family and friends. This is a pervasive problem that affects us all daily.Furthermore, I believe that watching television can foster laziness. After a long day at the office, many people spend at least three hours watching television, leaving little time for physical activity, such as going to the gym or engaging in sports. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to a preference for inactive pursuits over social and active ones.Additionally, some television programs can have a pernicious influence on viewers. Certain genres, such as thriller or action movies, often glorify negative behaviors like criminal activity. These programs can have a particularly detrimental impact on teenagers, who may attempt to emulate the behaviors they see on screen.In conclusion, the destructive nature of television is multifaceted, contributing to time wastage, laziness, and the promotion of negative behaviors. I firmly believe that this is a global issue that requires a collective effort to address. It is essential to acknowledge the problems associated with excessive television viewing and work together to find solutions to mitigate its negative effects.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;In modern times, men and women are participating equally in all fields, a stark contrast to the past when women were confined to domestic work and delicate tasks. Unfortunately, this outdated mindset still influences many people's thoughts, making them believe that women should only engage in such work even today. This attitude has led universities to adopt gender-based admission policies.Universities should, however, maintain a balanced approach and accept equal numbers of male and female students. The fact is, women have proven their capabilities in every sphere, whether indoors or outdoors. For instance, women are not only excelling as homemakers but also as pilots, showcasing their versatility. Moreover, university admissions should be based on academic merit rather than gender, ensuring fairness and equality.Yet, the current job market plays a significant role in shaping university decisions. Courses are designed to meet the demands of employers, who often have preconceived notions about the roles suited to each gender. For example, males are typically preferred for physically demanding jobs like machinery repair and installation, and for night shifts, while females are sought after for roles requiring a softer touch, such as counseling, teaching, and design. Consequently, universities tailor their programs to align with these job market requirements, often limiting certain subjects to specific genders.In conclusion, I firmly believe that universities should offer equal opportunities for all students to choose their subjects without gender-based restrictions. Today's youth is confident and ambitious, unwilling to be bound by societal or employer-imposed limitations. Female candidates, in particular, are breaking free from traditional barriers and pursuing their goals with determination. It is essential that we provide them with the opportunity to achieve their aspirations, fostering a more inclusive and equitable educational environment.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;Many young adults are eager to leave their parents' homes as soon as possible to gain independence and freedom from limitations. However, they often overlook the challenges that come with living away from home. Once they move out, they will be responsible for paying numerous bills, including rent or mortgage, utilities, and other expenses. To mitigate these costs, they may need to find a roommate, which can be a gamble as they may not get along with this person.Living with their parents, on the other hand, can be a significant cost-saver for young adults. When they live separately, they have to budget for loan payments, electricity, water, and even meals. For those still studying, this means juggling academic responsibilities with part-time jobs to make ends meet. In contrast, living at home eliminates these financial worries, as parents typically provide for their children's needs. Additionally, parents often offer their children financial support, allowing them to focus solely on their studies.Another potential issue for young adults living independently is finding a compatible roommate. They may be stuck with someone whose habits, behavior, and values clash with their own, leading to a stressful living situation. Sharing a room or living space with someone who doesn't share their interests or viewpoints can be particularly problematic, as it limits their ability to seek advice or support from their roommate. Instead, they may find themselves arguing frequently, rather than collaborating and helping each other.In conclusion, I believe that it is beneficial for young adults to live with their parents, given the advantages it offers. By doing so, they can avoid financial stress and the potential headaches of living with an incompatible roommate, allowing them to focus on their personal and academic growth without unnecessary distractions.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;Air pollution poses a significant threat to the environment, contributing to ozone depletion and exacerbating global warming. To mitigate this issue, I argue that private individuals and companies should bear more responsibility for cleaning up air pollution. One potential solution is to impose a financial burden on those who contribute to pollution, incentivizing them to reduce their environmental impact.In many industrialized countries, large corporations operate factories that generate substantial amounts of waste and harmful emissions, significantly contributing to air pollution. Despite reaping substantial profits, many of these companies neglect to implement measures to minimize their pollution output. By obliging them to pay for the cleanup of air pollution, they would be motivated to reduce their emissions and adopt more sustainable practices.Private individuals also play a role in air pollution through unnecessary activities such as excessive car use and inefficient house heating. During winter, many households rely on heating, but some fail to use filters to reduce pollution from heating systems. Additionally, certain vehicles emit high levels of pollutants. In my opinion, charging private individuals for their contribution to air pollution would encourage them to adopt more environmentally friendly habits, ultimately reducing overall pollution levels.However, governments also have a critical role to play in addressing air pollution. They should restrict the use of products that cause pollution, both for individuals and companies. Furthermore, governments should allocate a portion of their budget to clean up the air, rather than placing the entire burden on companies and private individuals.In conclusion, while governments are ultimately responsible for providing a healthy environment for their citizens, private individuals and companies must take the lead in cleaning up air pollution. By sharing the responsibility and implementing measures such as financial incentives and restrictions on polluting products, we can work towards reducing air pollution and mitigating its harmful effects on the environment.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;In today's market, companies offer a vast array of products to consumers. While advertising is a crucial factor in convincing consumers to make a purchase, it is not enough on its own. The product must also meet the needs and expectations of the consumer. In my opinion, advertising plays a significant role in driving high sales figures, and there are several reasons why this is the case.We are often first introduced to products through advertisements, which is why advertisers strive to be creative and persuasive in their messaging. When consumers are impressed by an advertisement, they may become convinced that the product is a necessity. For example, a recent TV advertisement for a soft drink featured a compelling storyline that encouraged viewers to reach for the product on hot days. As a result, sales of the product are likely to increase.Furthermore, the more frequently an advertisement appears in mass media, the more recognizable and popular the product becomes. Advertising is the most effective way to create a well-known brand, and consumers often opt for the most familiar product when choosing between two similar brands. When a product is widely used, it tends to become trusted by society, regardless of its quality. However, affordability is also an essential factor for consumers. Considering these points, advertisements have a profound impact on society, making the advertised product more desirable and preferable.In conclusion, I believe that consumers should prioritize their major needs when making purchasing decisions. High sales figures are often a reflection of effective advertising, which can influence consumer behavior and drive demand for a product.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";There is ongoing debate about whether it is beneficial for young people to attend university. Some argue that it is crucial for students to receive high-quality education at universities in order to contribute to the country's development, while others believe that it may actually contribute to higher unemployment rates. This essay will examine both perspectives in order to arrive at a well-informed decision.On the one hand, those who oppose university education present several arguments. From their perspective, there are numerous job opportunities available to those without a university degree, such as mechanics, salespeople, and engineers. Furthermore, job opportunities for graduates are scarce. The labor market for highly educated individuals is also highly competitive, making it difficult for them to secure employment after completing their studies. This can result in a significant waste of national productivity, as young people spend a substantial amount of time searching for high-paying jobs, which can be a time-consuming and futile endeavor.On the other hand, there are those who argue that universities provide not only career skills but also essential academic knowledge that benefits humanity, such as biology, politics, and medicine. These academic pursuits are necessary for global progress. Moreover, research conducted at universities has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries and achievements that have contributed to the advancement of modern society. Another significant advantage of universities is that the diverse experiences and opportunities available on campus, such as internships, in-depth discussions, independent living, and exchange scholarships, can make the younger generation more competent and well-rounded.In conclusion, both arguments for and against the necessity of university education have valid justifications. However, I agree with the latter perspective. Although higher education does not guarantee success for young students, the benefits of learning at universities are a crucial factor in creating more opportunities for societal development through the advancement of academic knowledge and the empowerment of the young generation, who gain valuable experiences and challenges that prepare them for the future.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;The rise of mobile phones has brought about unprecedented convenience, but also a multitude of problems, including social, medical, and technical issues. However, I firmly believe that the benefits of mobile phones outweigh their drawbacks. In this essay, I will examine these three concerns to substantiate my stance.Firstly, it is inevitable that any significant change in our lifestyle will give rise to social problems. Mobile phones are no exception. The inappropriate use of mobile phones in public areas, such as schools, libraries, and hospitals, is considered rude and disruptive. Furthermore, some students exploit their mobile phones as a means to cheat during exams, exchanging answers via text messages. Nevertheless, these problems can be mitigated with the implementation of effective regulations and rules.It is also noteworthy that excessive mobile phone use can have severe health consequences. Research has shown that prolonged use of electronic devices, including mobile phones, may increase the risk of hearing loss and even cancer, although further investigation is required to confirm these findings.Another contentious issue is the technical aspect of mobile phone security. There is a growing concern that conversations can be intercepted by third parties, a possibility that always exists. However, it is also possible to develop more efficient and reliable systems to safeguard users' private information.On the other hand, mobile phones have become indispensable multifunctional tools in daily life. They serve not only as a means of communication but also as internet browsers, music players, personal organizers, and more.In conclusion, while it is true that nothing can be used excessively without adverse effects, the contributions of mobile phones to modern society are undeniable, and people's dependence on them is irreversible. Although mobile phones pose several challenges that need to be addressed, their benefits ultimately outweigh their drawbacks.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;In today's world, where technology has advanced significantly, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives. There is an ongoing debate about whether computers are beneficial for children and should be used by them on a daily basis. Some individuals believe that computers are advantageous for kids, while others disagree. In my opinion, the latter viewpoint holds more truth.Firstly, constant computer use can have detrimental effects on children's eyesight. Prolonged periods of focusing on a computer screen can lead to eye strain, which is a primary cause of various eye problems, most notably shortsightedness.Moreover, excessive computer gaming can severely impair children's communication skills, leaving them with limited knowledge about the world outside their screens. It is well-documented that individuals addicted to games, especially online games, can face severe consequences. For instance, several teenagers have been known to play games non-stop, leading to health issues such as depression. A notable example is the case of a Korean gamer who died after playing continuously for three days.Lastly, even those who are not interested in online gaming can still be negatively affected by excessive computer use. Social surveys have indicated that while some children use computers for educational purposes, the majority are drawn to social media platforms like Facebook and blogs instead. This distraction can lead to poor academic performance, as children who are unable to disconnect from the internet will have little time for their studies.In conclusion, although the importance of computers in human life is undeniable, they also have a downside, particularly for children. It is crucial for people to learn how to use computers appropriately, making them an effective tool for not just entertainment, but also for work and educational purposes. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits of computers while minimizing their negative impacts.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The debate about constructing large factories near residential areas has become a contentious issue in today's society. While industrial buildings are a necessary component of modern society, driving economic development, many people oppose their construction due to concerns about pollution. In my opinion, the benefits of building a factory outweigh the drawbacks if environmental issues are effectively addressed.Firstly, a large factory can boost local economic growth and decrease unemployment rates. The demand for labor to manufacture goods creates job opportunities for local residents. Moreover, the establishment of a factory often leads to the development of other industries and businesses, resulting in economic growth in the area. For instance, the real estate industry may experience a surge to meet the accommodation needs of workers.The primary disadvantage of factories is pollution. Over-industrialization has led to severe environmental and health problems in some areas, including water pollution, traffic congestion, and medical issues. For example, workers in some industrial cities suffer from respiratory problems like asthma, which can be caused by waste ashes and chemicals.However, as our society continues to develop, the construction of more factories is inevitable. Therefore, focusing on mitigating the negative impacts of factories is more crucial than debating their construction. In fact, most problems can be avoided if factories make a genuine effort to manage their waste and pollution responsibly.In conclusion, the establishment of manufacturing plants is a natural trend in the industrialization process of many countries. As long as factories properly dispose of waste and pollution, the advantages of their construction will outweigh the disadvantages, making them a valuable component of modern society.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;In today's fast-paced world, many people are turning to pre-prepared meals as a convenient option for their daily nutrition. The perceived benefit of saving time, which is often viewed as a valuable commodity in modern society, is a major driving force behind this trend. However, the reliance on pre-prepared food has several detrimental effects, including the use of artificial ingredients, the disregard for nutritional value, and the alteration of eating habits. This essay will delve into these issues, arguing that the proliferation of pre-prepared meals is not beneficial, based on these three key concerns.Firstly, the production of pre-prepared food often involves the addition of a wide array of artificial ingredients to enhance taste and ease of preparation. Unfortunately, some of these additives have been linked to severe health consequences. News articles and research studies frequently highlight the correlation between certain chemical components in food and the onset of diseases. This underscores the potential health risks associated with consuming pre-prepared foods.Moreover, the shift away from fresh food preparation can lead to a deficiency in essential nutrients. While pre-prepared meals require significantly less time to cook compared to fresh food, research indicates that they often fail to provide the necessary nutrients, particularly for children during their developmental stages. This nutritional shortfall can have long-term implications for health and wellbeing.Additionally, the increasing reliance on pre-prepared foods threatens the preservation of culinary skills and cultural heritage. Cooking is an art form that not only provides sustenance but also embodies tradition and cultural identity. As people increasingly opt for quick, microwaveable meals, there is a noticeable decline in cooking skills. This trend contributes to a modification of eating habits, potentially leading to the erosion of culinary customs and cultural practices related to food preparation.In conclusion, while pre-prepared foods may cater to the time constraints of busy individuals, they are not without their drawbacks. Contrary to the perception that cooking is a waste of time, it is, in fact, essential for maintaining health, preserving cultural traditions, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the art of food preparation. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the value of cooking and the potential negative impacts of a diet heavily reliant on pre-prepared meals.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;The disparity between developed and developing countries is a well-known issue that has been growing increasingly. While some developed countries and organizations provide financial assistance to impoverished nations, it is argued that this is not the most effective or sole means of support. This argument will be substantiated by examining the importance of education and the true intentions of supporters.First and foremost, education plays a vital role in development. Many developing countries lack essential educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems, and teaching facilities, which are often overlooked by local authorities. For instance, the absence of these resources hinders the development of these countries, even if they receive significant economic support. Therefore, the most critical approach to improving the condition of poor countries is to assist them in establishing a comprehensive educational system, rather than relying solely on financial aid.Moreover, it is a widely accepted notion that there is no such thing as a free lunch in the world. This implies that powerful countries often provide financial support with the ulterior motive of gaining the right to exploit local resources and tap into the local labor market. In reality, they rarely offer technological assistance to local residents and may even cause environmental degradation in some areas. Consequently, developing countries should not solely rely on financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only means of supporting impoverished nations. It has been demonstrated that developing education, enhancing national technology, and advancing scientific levels are essential steps that developing countries must take if they genuinely wish to alter their current situation. By focusing on these areas, developing countries can work towards achieving sustainable development and reducing their dependence on external financial support.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The prevalence of advertising in our daily lives is undeniable. We are constantly bombarded with ads, and opinions about their usefulness vary. Some argue that companies waste their resources on advertising, while others believe that ads serve no purpose and should be completely banned due to the harm they cause to society. However, I propose a more nuanced approach to this issue. In my opinion, advertising is a necessary component of modern society, but it is our collective responsibility to regulate its content and ensure that the goods and services being promoted are suitable for our audience.Firstly, I firmly believe that advertising certain products, such as alcohol, cigarettes, and goods with adult content, should be prohibited. Exposure to these ads can have a detrimental influence on children, potentially leading them to develop unhealthy habits like smoking or drinking. Fortunately, some countries have taken steps to address this concern, banning such advertisements to protect their young citizens.On the other hand, advertising plays a vital role in promoting goods and services offered by companies, businesses, and individuals. Through ads, we gain knowledge about new products, enabling us to compare and select the best options for our needs. In today's economy, not only private businesses but also governments rely heavily on advertising. For instance, tourism constitutes a significant portion of the Czech Republic's economy, with the government needing to advertise the country's attractions to attract foreign visitors. Well-planned and targeted advertising is crucial in this context, as it can effectively draw more tourists and boost the economy.In conclusion, I firmly believe that modern society benefits from advertising, as it keeps us informed about new products and services. Nonetheless, it is imperative to acknowledge the negative impact that advertising certain harmful products, like cigarettes and alcohol, can have on children. By striking a balance and responsibly managing the content of advertisements, we can harness the benefits of advertising while protecting the well-being of our society, especially its younger members.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;Firstly, the additional income earned by women can significantly contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can supplement her family's income, which is especially important when her husband's salary is low or when job opportunities are scarce. Therefore, it is a common and necessary practice for women to share the financial responsibilities with their husbands.Secondly, working outside the home provides married women with opportunities to interact with the outside world, develop their character, and demonstrate their capabilities. This, in turn, boosts their confidence and independence. As a result, they become better role models for their children and are able to fulfill their responsibilities as mothers and wives more effectively.Lastly, there are now various support systems in place to help women balance their work and household responsibilities. Government policies that encourage shared family responsibilities, husbands who are willing to contribute to household chores, and employers who offer part-time jobs for women all facilitate this balance.In conclusion, a well-managed home does not require the housewife's constant presence, and married women can pursue careers to enjoy the benefits of working life outside the home.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";I firmly believe that primary and secondary education are essential in providing people with fundamental knowledge and skills. It is the government's responsibility to provide these basic levels of education to its citizens. However, when it comes to higher education, such as university, I think it is reasonable that students or their parents should bear the cost of tuition fees.While some parents may struggle to afford university fees for their children, I also consider it unfair to expect the government to cover these costs, given the significant investment they already make in primary and secondary education. Instead, the government could allocate these funds to support other students in accessing basic education, promoting equality in educational opportunities across the country.Students who have acquired basic knowledge and education are capable of securing part-time jobs to finance their own university studies if their parents are unable to do so. By paying their own fees, students become more accountable for their academic pursuits. Moreover, this independence fosters personal growth and prepares them for the professional world.This approach also encourages parents to think creatively about how to support their children's future aspirations, recognizing that they too have a role to play in contributing to their children's educational and career goals.In conclusion, I strongly agree that the government should not be responsible for covering university fees. By doing so, both parents and students are empowered to take charge of their own futures, rather than relying solely on government support. This shared responsibility promotes a sense of ownership and motivation among individuals to achieve their educational and professional objectives.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;In recent years, the topic of transportation has garnered significant attention. While some argue that cars are the most convenient mode of transportation, others contend that alternative modes should be considered due to environmental concerns. I strongly agree that alternative transportation methods and international regulations to control car usage should be implemented. This essay will outline several key reasons to support this stance.Firstly, the rising number of cars on the road leads to increased environmental pollution. The exhaust fumes and carbon dioxide emissions from cars have detrimental effects on air quality, contributing to respiratory diseases among local residents. Therefore, it is essential to shift towards alternative modes of transportation and establish laws to regulate car usage.Secondly, the growing number of cars results in severe traffic congestion. Getting stuck in traffic jams wastes valuable time and can also irritate drivers, leading to an increase in traffic accidents. To address this issue, methods to reduce car ownership and usage should be devised and implemented promptly.To tackle these problems, alternative transportation modes and international laws regulating car ownership and usage can be effective solutions. Alternative modes, such as those that emit fewer carbon dioxide and gases than cars, are ideal. For instance, several European countries have introduced rental bicycle systems, where bikes are stationed at district corners and can be ridden to other areas for a small fee. As bicycles do not emit harmful gases or carbon dioxide, they offer a more environmentally friendly option compared to cars. International laws can also be effective, such as regulations limiting car usage by time and restricting individuals to owning only one car. These efforts to reduce car numbers can alleviate traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In conclusion, despite the perceived convenience of cars, I firmly believe that alternative transportation modes and international regulations to control car usage are necessary for environmental protection and reducing traffic congestion.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";"In today's world, the concept of ""globalization"" is universally recognized, implying that the world has become a more interconnected place where every country influences and is influenced by others in numerous ways. As a result, both governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focusing on promoting harmony and providing aid to impoverished nations. While it is true that simply providing aid to poor countries can be manipulated by powerful nations, and that a significant amount of resources and funding can lead to corruption and political dependence, I firmly believe that assisting poor countries has overwhelmingly positive effects for several reasons.Firstly, poor countries often lack the basic materials and infrastructure necessary to establish and grow businesses, which is essential for escaping poverty. Providing aid in this context helps poor countries address their economic challenges and become self-sufficient. A notable example is the Republic of Korea, which was one of the poorest countries in the 1960s, even compared to some African nations. However, after receiving aid from other countries for a decade, it has emerged as a strong economy and is now assisting other poor countries.Secondly, aid campaigns raise awareness about the plight of poor people and encourage consideration and empathy from those in richer countries. When people in affluent nations reflect on the struggles of those in poverty and affected by diseases, they are less likely to take their own abundance for granted. This not only fosters a sense of harmony and love but also provides an opportunity to learn about the humane aspects of globalization.Thirdly, aid campaigns can have practical benefits in a globalized world, where the economies of several countries are interconnected and influence one another. For instance, when the American mortgage loan system faced difficulties, several European and Asian countries' economies fluctuated, and many countries required international support to avoid bankruptcy.In conclusion, the three key points highlighting the positive effects of aid are: supporting poor countries in building their economies, fostering humane concepts among people, and maintaining a strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a responsible global neighbor by aiding poor countries will continue to be a priority for many organizations and volunteers, ultimately making the world a better place to live."
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Throughout history, the world has undergone numerous transformations, each with its inherent advantages and disadvantages. Globalization, a gradual and far-reaching change, is no exception to this rule. While it has undeniable impacts on the global economy, it also has secondary effects that render it a topic of debate.Some individuals view globalization as a menace to the ethnic and religious values of their native country. They believe that the concept of globalization jeopardizes their cultural heritage, exposing it to uncontrolled transformation and making it susceptible to the influence of imperialistic governments.On the other hand, those who disagree argue that globalization significantly contributes to the global betterment of the world in various aspects. As globalization advances, people gain greater access to the world's natural resources, thereby accelerating scientific and economic progress globally. Moreover, they acknowledge that globalization presents an opportunity for individuals from each country to enhance their lifestyle through imported goods and services from other nations.Furthermore, proponents of globalization assert that it leads to a substantial decrease in global tensions due to the convergence of benefits among people worldwide, a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I align myself with the proponents of globalization, perceiving it as a catalyst for global progress. I firmly believe that it is more likely to alleviate the world's problems rather than exacerbate them.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate about whether children should prioritize studying at school or enter the workforce early has sparked a heated discussion. While some argue that attending school can provide students with valuable knowledge and skills, preparing them for a successful future, others believe that it may hinder their ability to gain practical experience and independence through early employment. Personally, I align with the view that students should be encouraged to continue their education at school.Firstly, schools provide students with an ideal learning environment, staffed by experienced professors and equipped with high-quality programs. This setup fosters the perfect conditions for students to focus on their academic work, distracting them from non-essential activities. Secondly, schools offer a plethora of academic knowledge, enabling students to acquire professional skills, broaden their understanding, and accumulate valuable experiences. As a result, students have increased opportunities to secure better job prospects and achieve success in their future endeavors. For instance, employers often prefer hiring individuals with higher education degrees and specialized skills.However, it's understandable that some people advocate for children to discontinue their education and pursue employment. Although schools offer a wealth of knowledge, some subjects may hold little relevance to their future careers. Moreover, having a job can teach children essential social skills, such as independence, money management, and self-esteem. Working experience can provide them with unique opportunities that may not be available in a school setting.In conclusion, I firmly believe that attending school is the most beneficial choice for children's future. Although there are advantages to leaving school to enter the workforce, the benefits of studying at school far outweigh them. There are alternative methods to teach children independence and social skills, such as internships, volunteering, or part-time jobs, that do not require them to sacrifice their education.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;In today's world, advertisements are omnipresent, from TV commercials to street posters. Many people believe that these ads persuade consumers to purchase unnecessary products that look appealing on TV, but lack real value. I share this perspective.Companies invest heavily in advertising to drive sales and attract customers. Often, the focus is not on the product's functionality or quality, but rather on creating a desirable image associated with owning the product. This is achieved by partnering with celebrities, who endorse products like motorcycles or clothing, resulting in significant sales boosts among young consumers. For these consumers, owning such products is a status symbol, making quality a secondary concern.Although advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, they also play a crucial economic role. They introduce new products, offer choices, and are often visually engaging, aiming to capture attention. Advertising helps maintain reasonable prices, fosters fair competition, and prevents market monopolies, which would limit consumer choices and drive up prices.While the influence of advertising should not be underestimated, ultimately, the purchasing decision lies with us, the consumers. Regardless of how enticing ads may be, we must make informed, independent decisions. By doing so, we can navigate the advertising landscape effectively, recognizing both its economic benefits and its potential to persuade us into unnecessary purchases.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;In our society, guns are not considered a typical commodity, and their use is heavily regulated in most countries. However, the level of gun control varies significantly from one country to another, making it a contentious issue worldwide. From my perspective, implementing strict gun control measures is a sensible approach.One key consideration is the risk of accidents involving firearms. Even with stringent licensing requirements, accidents cannot be entirely eliminated. For instance, we occasionally hear reports of hunting accidents that result in injuries. It logically follows that fewer guns in circulation would lead to fewer accidents, creating a safer environment with lower incident rates.Furthermore, a significant proportion of violent crimes are linked to the misuse of firearms, particularly in countries where gun availability is relatively high. If this trend persists, it will inevitably contribute to the creation of a violent society. The United States, for example, has experienced tragic incidents of school shootings, often perpetrated by young adults or juveniles who have accessed guns. Moreover, the fact that some terrorists can acquire more advanced weaponry than law enforcement agencies puts citizens at constant risk.Additionally, the availability of guns can also contribute to higher suicide rates. In the United States, firearms are the most common method of suicide, accounting for approximately 50% of all suicide cases. Unfortunately, there is a growing trend of suicides among adolescents and individuals aged 75 and above.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates, I firmly believe that guns should be strictly regulated, and governments should enact a series of laws to protect our societies from violence.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;International sporting events provide a unique opportunity for fans from different nations to come together, united by their shared passion. This shared enthusiasm helps to foster global understanding, bridging cultural and national divides. Moreover, these events play a crucial role in alleviating international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions.When an international sporting event is hosted in a country, it attracts a massive following from fans worldwide. For the duration of the event, people from diverse backgrounds, nationalities, and religions coexist harmoniously. This convergence facilitates a deeper understanding of different countries and cultures, which is particularly beneficial in easing tensions between nations. A notable example is the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where despite the heightened tensions between North Korea and South Korea following the sinking of a warship, North Korea demonstrated friendship and enthusiasm, offering a rare glimpse into the country and helping to alleviate tension.In addition to easing international tensions, these events also offer a platform for fans to express their patriotic emotions safely. When fans gather to support their teams, they exhibit their national pride, but the competitive spirit of the sport ensures that these emotions are expressed in a controlled and respectful manner. Furthermore, the global attention and media coverage that these events attract motivate fans to showcase their country in the best possible light. For instance, during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese made considerable efforts to present a spectacular image of their country to the world. Visitors were warmly welcomed by friendly volunteers, showcasing Chinese hospitality and the beauty of its cities, all of which was driven by the patriotic desire to present a positive image of China to the global community.In conclusion, international sporting events captivate global attention and contribute to a more peaceful world. By facilitating international understanding, easing tensions, and providing a safe outlet for patriotic expressions, these events underscore the power of sports in uniting people across the globe and fostering peace.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;Over the past two hundred years, technology has made tremendous strides in various aspects of our society, including telecommunications, manufacturing, and construction. Undoubtedly, technology has also greatly impacted our daily lives. However, some people argue that the proliferation of technology among the general public has a negative effect, exacerbating the gap between the rich and the poor. Personally, I disagree with this viewpoint for the following reasons.Firstly, advancements in material technology have led to a significant decrease in the prices of numerous products. About a decade ago, mobile phones were a luxury only a few affluent individuals in my country could afford. Today, mobile phones have become a common household item, thanks to cheaper materials and improved manufacturing technologies. As a result, most members of our society, particularly the poor, can benefit from the consequences of technological advancements.Secondly, technical developments have enhanced productivity, allowing people to escape from mundane daily chores and invest more time and energy in education and living a more meaningful life. The development of the Internet has brought about numerous conveniences, enabling us to access information and connect with others effortlessly. In the past, we had to spend a considerable amount of time searching for information and waiting for letters from friends who lived far away. Nowadays, we can communicate with friends online, regardless of our location or distance between us. Moreover, the Internet provides equal access to information for everyone, leading to greater equality among individuals.While it is true that everything has its drawbacks, and technology is no exception. To some extent, technology can widen the gap between the rich and the poor, as only the affluent can afford expensive high-tech products, which can further increase their wealth. Nevertheless, I believe this is a weak argument against the numerous benefits of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap between the rich and the poor.In conclusion, the benefits of technology are undeniable. When utilized properly, technology can bring about immense benefits for humanity, and its advancements can have a lasting positive impact on our lives.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"For centuries, outer space has been a fascinating field of study, with numerous successful space expeditions launched. However, many people still view space exploration as a frivolous waste of resources, citing the example of astronauts bringing back ""useless rocks"" despite the substantial investment in their equipment. Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons for humans to venture into outer space.Firstly, space exploration has enabled the discovery of numerous facts about our solar system. For instance, images of Earth from space have conclusively proven that our planet is round, not flat. Additionally, space exploration has revealed that Earth orbits the Sun, not the other way around. Without space exploration, these fundamental facts would remain unknown.Secondly, observing Earth from outer space has provided valuable insights into our planet's composition, including its atmosphere. This knowledge can be leveraged to develop strategies for mitigating Earth's hazards, such as global warming. By studying our planet from a unique perspective, we can gain a deeper understanding of its complexities and work towards preserving it.Lastly, space exploration has driven the invention of sophisticated technologies. The need for astronauts to survive in oxygen-free environments has spurred research into oxygen tanks, which have proven useful not only in space but also underwater. Other innovations, such as spaceships, communication satellites, and space pens, have also made significant contributions to society.In conclusion, I firmly believe that humans should continue to explore outer space. Despite the significant costs involved, the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the expenses. The discoveries, insights, and innovations that have resulted from space travel have greatly enhanced our understanding of the universe and improved life on Earth. Therefore, I strongly advocate for continued investment in space exploration, as it holds the key to unlocking new knowledge, driving technological advancements, and ultimately, improving our world."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In today's academic landscape, it's common for students to take on part-time jobs alongside their university studies. While some may argue that this has negative consequences, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. This essay will delve into the advantages of students having part-time jobs, exploring the ways in which they can gain valuable experience, develop essential life skills, and achieve greater independence.One of the primary benefits of part-time jobs is that they provide students with hands-on experience, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting. This is particularly important given the limited opportunities for practical training in universities. By working part-time, students can acquire both academic knowledge and real-world experience, making them more competitive in the job market after graduation. Furthermore, having work experience during their student years gives them a distinct advantage when applying for jobs, as they can demonstrate their ability to balance work and academic responsibilities.Additionally, students who take on part-time jobs tend to be more confident and independent than their peers. Interacting with colleagues in a professional environment, where they can freely express their ideas, helps build their confidence. The workplace also demands independence in thinking, problem-solving, and time management, skills that are highly transferable to academic settings. This independence and confidence boost can have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall demeanor.Another significant advantage of part-time jobs is the financial support they offer. The cost of tuition, combined with living expenses, can be overwhelming for students. Earning money through part-time jobs, although it may not be substantial, can help alleviate some of these financial pressures. Moreover, being financially independent reduces reliance on family support and prepares students for the responsibilities of independent living after university.In conclusion, I am convinced that having a part-time job during university years provides students with numerous benefits, including valuable work experience, enhanced confidence and independence, and financial assistance. By engaging in part-time work, students can mitigate issues related to employment readiness, self-assurance, and financial stability. I believe that the trend of students seeking part-time employment will continue to grow, reflecting the increasingly recognized value of balancing work and study.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The purpose of this essay is to explore the benefits that students and organizations can gain from unpaid internships, where students are sent by their schools to work for companies without a salary. This essay will analyze the advantages of such arrangements for both students and companies, followed by a concluding summary.To start, students can gain invaluable experiences during their time working for assigned institutions. Since most school curriculums focus on theoretical courses, often taught through lectures in a classroom setting, students may lack a realistic understanding of the challenges they will face in the workforce after graduation. Unpaid internships, despite the lack of financial compensation, provide students with experiences that cannot be bought. These internships offer a unique opportunity for students to learn beyond the textbook and classroom, preparing them for the real world.Companies also benefit from hosting unpaid interns. The most obvious advantage is cost savings, as they do not have to pay the interns. Moreover, the younger generation can bring fresh perspectives and ideas, unencumbered by traditional workloads and enriched by their imagination. This can be particularly valuable when developing new advertising campaigns or slogans. Additionally, companies can use this period to identify and begin training potential future employees, thereby saving time and resources that would be spent on recruiting and orienting new staff.In conclusion, students can acquire valuable, real-world work experience through unpaid internships, which can significantly enhance their future job prospects. Meanwhile, organizations can benefit in multiple ways, including saving time and money, as well as gaining insights from the perspectives of young people. Overall, both students and organizations stand to gain substantially from such arrangements, making them a beneficial and forward-thinking practice.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;This essay aims to explore the notion that higher salaries are the sole motivator for employees to be more diligent and productive. The discussion will commence with an analysis of the factors contributing to increased productivity and conclude with a statement of my stance on the matter.It is undeniable that salary increases or promotions can enhance workplace morale. Employees are more likely to work harder to meet expectations and prove their worth when they feel valued. For example, junior high school teachers bear significant responsibility for their students' academic and personal development during adolescence. In Taiwan, teachers who receive higher salaries are more inclined to devote extra time to mentoring students, rather than relying on cram schools and other external resources.However, I firmly believe that fostering a pleasant working environment is a more practical and essential approach to boosting productivity and employee performance. Companies like Google exemplify this approach by providing recreation rooms and generous personal leave, resulting in a more relaxed and supportive workforce. By doing so, employers can ensure that employees are able to focus on their projects without distractions, such as family concerns or pressure.In conclusion, while higher pay can be an incentive for harder-working employees, I argue that creating a secure and relaxing work environment is more effective in enhancing productivity. When employees feel valued and supported, they are more likely to perform at their best and be motivated to deliver exceptional results for their employers.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;The desire to come together and engage in friendly competition with talented individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds through popular games has long been a powerful motivator for people worldwide. This inclination is so deeply ingrained in human nature that the planning of such events persists, even in the face of significant social challenges faced by some participants. It is widely acknowledged that large-scale sports competitions divert attention from international conflicts to captivating contests, fostering national pride among spectators. This essay will examine the role of sports events in promoting peace and encouraging the display of national symbols.Firstly, during times of conflict, international sports events provide a much-needed distraction for people living in affected countries, allowing them to reconnect with the global community. For instance, when Iraq was severely impacted by the Second Gulf War, its citizens sought news about the Football World Cup through portable radios, demonstrating the ability of international sports competitions to uplift people and encourage a return to relative normalcy. Thus, global sports events play a significant role in drawing people back towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions offer a unique opportunity for people to showcase their national pride. The Football World Cup in South Africa, for example, saw citizens fill stadiums, cheer, and wave national flags in support of their team. The event also featured traditional South African songs being played throughout the night, illustrating how people draw upon their cultural heritage to proudly display their national identity. As a result, it is evident that international sports events provide a platform for people to express their patriotic feelings freely.In conclusion, the analysis of global games' impact on both war-torn countries and host nations reveals that they not only promote a peaceful society but also facilitate public displays of national pride. This phenomenon has been a constant for centuries and is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, underscoring the significance of sports events in fostering global unity and harmony.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The world's growing population and rapid technological advancements have led to an increased demand for energy, surpassing past requirements. Fortunately, there are abundant and eco-friendly resources available, such as nuclear and solar energy, which can help meet this demand. This essay will examine these alternatives in more detail.Currently, water is the primary source of energy globally. However, many countries, including India, still heavily rely on this limited resource, resulting in frequent power outages during summer months due to insufficient fundamental resources. Encouraging the use of alternative energy sources like nuclear, solar, or wind power could alleviate these distribution issues. Therefore, it would be a prudent move for governments to explore these other available sources for electricity generation.Moreover, the predominant energy sources used today release substantial amounts of gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. For instance, using a solar cooker instead of an electric one could significantly reduce global warming. Similarly, opting for nuclear energy over traditional hydro-kinetic energy results in less atmospheric pollution. This shift towards cleaner energy sources is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change.In conclusion, promoting alternative energy sources would be a wise decision for governments, enabling the utilization of available natural resources and subsequently reducing global warming. Furthermore, governments should incentivize and encourage the public to adopt solar and nuclear energy, among other alternatives, to create a more sustainable energy future.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;Unemployment is a pervasive issue that affects both developed and developing countries. In my opinion, the onus of addressing this problem lies with the individuals themselves, rather than relying solely on government support. Government funds should be allocated to programs that benefit the public at large, as tax revenue is generated from working individuals who contribute to the system. Allocating these funds to support those who do not contribute to society may be perceived as unfair by taxpayers. Moreover, governments face numerous pressing demands on their expenditure, such as healthcare and education, which should take precedence over addressing unemployment.In today's competitive world, it is essential to work diligently and acquire necessary skills to succeed. Providing unconditional financial assistance from the government may inadvertently discourage individuals from working altogether. However, this does not imply that those in need should be abandoned. Many individuals face insurmountable challenges, and external support is crucial to help them overcome their difficulties. In such cases, the government can provide alternative forms of assistance, such as free vocational training or interest-free loans, to empower them to regain employment. This approach ultimately benefits society as a whole, as it enables individuals to contribute to the workforce once again.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of government support for disadvantaged individuals, I believe that direct financial aid may not be the most effective solution. Instead, individuals should take primary responsibility for improving their circumstances, with the government offering supplementary assistance to facilitate their return to the workforce.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;In recent times, universities have emerged as the go-to destinations for individuals seeking to enhance their expertise. However, it is questionable whether this aligns with the needs of potential employers, as universities have become increasingly specialized, with a deeper understanding of narrower fields. Amidst the diverse range of options available, some training courses do have practical implications for job seekers and everyday life. While I appreciate the universities' goal of providing such courses to foster work-ready skills and support their mission, I don't believe this is the primary or most effective role of a university.At its core, a university serves as a conduit for knowledge dissemination, prioritizing students' needs over those of employers. Students seek out universities to acquire knowledge, broaden their understanding of industries, or delve deeper into research interests. High school graduates enroll in universities for various reasons, including the pursuit of widely recognized degrees, gaining industry insights, or exploring specific fields in greater depth.On the other hand, universities are viewed as hubs for rich educational resources. Consequently, it is not necessary for universities to offer specific courses or training programs, but rather make these resources available as needed. The truth lies in the fact that universities should provide access to information, rather than curating courses that cater to employers' preferences.In conclusion, the fundamental purpose of a university remains the provision of knowledge and access to resources. Nevertheless, offering courses that focus on workplace skills can be beneficial in shaping students' futures, and universities can strike a balance between these two objectives.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The debate about keeping wild animals in zoos is a highly contentious issue, with proponents arguing that wildlife is well-cared for by professionals, while opponents argue that the animals are stripped of their freedom. In my opinion, however, animals belong in their natural habitats, not in zoos.First and foremost, wild species have the inherent right to live in an environment free from human interference. Given that humans are responsible for the significant pollution and destruction of many wild animals' natural habitats, it is our duty to create a safe and natural environment for them to thrive in. The limited space and artificial surroundings of zoos cannot adequately compensate for the loss of their natural homes. Moreover, prolonged captivity can have detrimental effects on both the physical and mental well-being of the animals, leading to isolation and depression. In reality, zoos may be more harmful than helpful in protecting wildlife.Some argue that modern zoos, equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and staffed by professionals, provide superior care for the animals. They also claim that endangered species in zoos are protected from poaching. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that strict anti-poaching laws can provide a safe haven for various species in their natural habitats. Ultimately, the expansion of natural habitats seems to be the most effective solution for conserving wildlife globally.In conclusion, I firmly believe that wild animals should be freed from zoos, not only because they have the right to freedom, but also to escape the devastating effects of isolation and depression. By allowing them to roam free in their natural habitats, we can ensure the well-being and preservation of these incredible creatures.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The promotion of distance-learning versus traditional in-person lectures is a highly debated topic in the academic community. While some argue that attending lectures in person is superior to online degrees, I firmly believe that online teaching should be widely adopted by colleges and universities due to its convenience and cost-effectiveness.First and foremost, distance-learning offers unparalleled convenience to students worldwide. In the past, students were limited to attending local schools, often compromising on factors like teaching quality, teacher expertise, and institution reputation. However, with the advent of online courses, students can now access top-notch educational programs from renowned universities globally. Moreover, video conferencing enables teachers to reach a larger student base, allowing educational institutions to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. This, in turn, enables universities and colleges to offer scholarships to deserving students who face financial constraints.On the other hand, critics of online degrees argue that in-person lectures provide students with valuable opportunities to interact with teachers and peers. They emphasize the importance of traditional teaching methods, which involve discussions and collaborations among students, in making campus life engaging. They believe that real-time interactions and communications in class make education more appealing.In conclusion, I strongly believe that distance-learning will gain prominence in the future as the pace of life continues to accelerate. Nevertheless, it is essential to incorporate regular video conferencing sessions to facilitate discussions and interactions, ensuring that the joy of learning remains intact. By striking a balance between convenience, cost-effectiveness, and interactive learning, online teaching can provide a superior educational experience for students globally.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technologies, including mobile phones, emails, and internet chat programs like MSN Messenger, has revolutionized our lives in recent years. Despite this, there is ongoing debate about whether the overall impact of these innovations has been beneficial or detrimental. In my opinion, the majority of the global population has greatly benefited from these efficient and powerful communication tools.To start with, mobile phones and other modern communication tools have made it possible to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, as well as facilitate global business. With just a click of a button, vast amounts of information can be transmitted across the globe in a matter of seconds. Moreover, access to these communication tools is now available almost everywhere. With a mobile phone or laptop, individuals can communicate online from virtually any location, whether it's a bus stop, a corner shop, or any other place they can imagine. This convenience has undoubtedly made a significant positive impact on humanity.However, critics of modern communication argue that only the more affluent segments of society can reap the benefits. They also point out that the widespread adoption of these technologies comes with a substantial price tag. To utilize these innovations, individuals must not only purchase devices such as mobile phones or computers but also pay for communication services. As a result, people living in poverty are less likely to benefit from modern communication technologies.In conclusion, I firmly believe that modern communication technologies will continue to benefit an increasing number of people as the pace of life accelerates. Nevertheless, it is essential that we do not overlook the disadvantaged, who are unable to afford these technologies. Efforts should be made to address this issue and ensure that the benefits of modern communication are accessible to all, regardless of their economic circumstances.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate about whether music should be a compulsory subject in high school has sparked intense discussion, with some arguing that it is essential, while others believe it is unnecessary and should be optional. In this essay, I will present both perspectives and share my opinion.It is evident that music has a profound impact on human psychology and can have a positive influence on individuals. Many universities recognize the benefits of music and offer lessons to their students, promoting a harmonious and balanced learning environment. I believe that students who are heavily invested in academic subjects should have the opportunity to manage their stress through music, which can be a valuable and engaging outlet. Moreover, musical activities that involve multiple participants foster cooperation, teamwork, and camaraderie, essential skills for future success. Music also provides a platform for students with weaker academic backgrounds to showcase their talents, potentially creating a more serene and inclusive classroom atmosphere.On the other hand, while music can have numerous mentally enhancing effects on students, the demand in today's fast-paced world is for academically skilled employees rather than musically oriented individuals. I agree with the majority that music is an art that requires a specific attitude and dedication. Unless students are genuinely interested in music, they are unlikely to reap its benefits. Therefore, music and other extracurricular subjects should be optional, allowing students to focus on their professional development. In an era where time is the most valuable resource, I believe that students should prioritize occupation-related subjects over music or other leisure activities.In conclusion, to be a competitive professional, students must possess advanced knowledge in their field. However, music can play a significant role in shaping an individual's character. The integration of music into the learning process can be successful only if it is not compulsory, allowing students to pursue their interests and develop their skills in a way that is both enjoyable and beneficial.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;Libraries and sports facilities are crucial components of a university's success, and most university rankings take their quality into account. In my view, universities should prioritize investing in libraries over other areas.Firstly, I believe that a library is a vital and strategic part of a university. Both professors and students require a modern, well-equipped library, as it plays a significant role in research, second only to the internet. While sports are important, they do not hold the same priority as libraries. Moreover, only a small fraction of students participate in sports activities. For instance, at my university, the number of students using the library far exceeds those engaging in sports.Secondly, libraries typically do not generate income, as they are often free not only for students but also for the public. Consequently, university support is essential for libraries to function. In contrast, sports activities can yield a substantial income through various means, such as sponsorships for each match and ticket sales for significant events. This enables sports activities to compensate for their expenses, whereas libraries face significant challenges in finding alternative sources of income.Lastly, investing in libraries yields long-term benefits. For example, a library can acquire a large collection of new books or upgrade its computer facilities, most of which are durable and can be utilized for an extended period. Over time, these resources appreciate in value. On the other hand, most sports facilities, except for buildings, have a limited lifespan and are not sustainable in the long term.Despite the importance of sports activities, libraries are more critical to a university's success. A good university must have a modern library, which is an essential component of its infrastructure. Therefore, universities should allocate more resources to developing and maintaining their libraries.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The rise of globalization has led to English becoming the predominant language in international trade, conferences, and significant events, sparking a lively debate among the public. On one hand, some individuals argue that the widespread use of English offers numerous benefits. It facilitates clearer and more convenient communication and interaction between countries, effectively bridging the gap created by linguistic and geographical barriers. The innovation of transportation, such as airplanes and trains, has already alleviated geographical constraints, and the adoption of English as a universal language could potentially eliminate language barriers as well. Additionally, English is considered a systematic and extensive language, with the potential to enrich people's emotional and cultural lives through literature and art.On the other hand, critics contend that the dominance of English threatens cultural diversity and contributes to the extinction of lesser-used languages. Despite its sophistication, English may not fully capture the nuances of life, particularly in Asian countries with distinct linguistic systems. Language is intricately tied to daily life, culture, environment, and religion, making it a vital part of a community's identity. The replacement of native languages with English is seen as a form of cultural insensitivity.In conclusion, while English is an elegant language that should be promoted in various fields to enhance global trade and communication, it is equally important to preserve other languages to maintain linguistic and cultural diversity. This balanced approach would allow for the benefits of a global language to be realized while respecting and protecting the unique cultural heritages of different communities.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The intellectual superiority of humans has enabled them to dominate and domesticate numerous animals and birds, leveraging them to enhance their quality of life. While some individuals advocate for the utilization of animals to cater to human needs, others express concern about the potential misuse of animals. This discussion will delve into the arguments for and against the domestication of animals.Humans have harnessed various animals for personal gain, such as cows and other dairy animals for milk production. Similarly, animals like horses, cattle, and donkeys are employed for farming, agriculture, and transportation purposes. Many people keep pets, including dogs and cats, which are often trained as service dogs or sniffer dogs, providing valuable assistance to law enforcement and visually impaired individuals. These animals are also kept for security purposes in residential settings.However, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their physical limits. For instance, cows are frequently injected with Oxytocin, a hormone that artificially increases milk production, causing significant discomfort and pain to the animals. Furthermore, thousands of animals undergo agonizing suffering or death as a result of scientific research for drug development and product testing. Cage farming, which violates animal rights, is another egregious example. Other practices, such as equestrian sports, where horses are subjected to excessive physical strain and beaten by jockeys to enhance their performance, and pleasure hunting of defenseless animals, are also reprehensible.In my opinion, humans should assume the role of guardians rather than masters or lords over animals. Animal rights are established to impose limitations on human behavior, and the manipulation or exploitation of animals should be punishable as a serious offense. By adopting a guardian-like approach, humans can ensure the well-being and humane treatment of domesticated animals, ultimately promoting a more compassionate and responsible coexistence.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The increasing accessibility of exhibitions through television and the internet, thanks to modern technology, has led some to believe that museums and art galleries will soon become obsolete. However, I disagree and think that some of these institutions will continue to thrive.On the one hand, technology has undoubtedly made life more convenient. Watching exhibitions from home saves time and money that would be spent on transportation, which is a significant advantage in today's fast-paced society. Nevertheless, recent research suggests that this sedentary lifestyle, characterized by a lack of physical exercise and face-to-face interaction, can have negative consequences for individuals.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries in terms of education and culture is undeniable. Authentic exhibits cannot be fully replicated by images and videos, just as traveling to a place is more enriching than simply viewing its landscape on TV or in photos. The best way to learn about something is often through direct experience. Additionally, museums and art galleries play a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage, making them essential institutions that will endure as long as people value their cultural roots.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that modern technology has made it easier for people to access exhibitions from the comfort of their own homes, I firmly believe that museums and art galleries are essential and will continue to be preserved due to their significance in education and culture.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;Currently, it is widely accepted that students are required to study over eight subjects in school. However, the public is divided on whether students should be taught a broad range of subjects or focus on a single subject. Some parents are content with their children's full class schedule, while others argue that concentrating on one subject is more effective. Before sharing my own opinion, I will examine both sides of the debate.The advantages of teaching students various subjects are clear. Firstly, having basic knowledge in diverse fields provides students with more options when choosing specialized areas or careers in the future. At a young age, students are still undecided about their future paths and need exposure to different subjects. From a student's perspective, studying a combination of challenging and easy subjects balances their workload and fosters enthusiasm for classes. Nevertheless, many students find the varied curriculum overwhelming, leading to increased stress from excessive homework and exams. Additionally, most students view the extra knowledge as unnecessary and impractical for their future careers.Proponents of focusing on a single subject argue that this approach can cultivate more specialized talents and enhance studying effectiveness. This is likely because students can devote more time and effort to a single subject, reducing pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this method cannot be ignored. Most notably, in a target-oriented education environment, students may struggle to change their specialized field of study if they regret their initial choice. Furthermore, the monotony of courses may dampen their passion for learning.While concentrating on a single subject can reduce student pressure and improve talent training, its shortcomings have significant implications for students' futures. Therefore, I support the view that learning all school subjects is the better approach.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;In today's world, it's undeniable that the growing dominance of English has led to a decline in minority languages. While some view this as a necessary sacrifice in the era of globalization, others argue that the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. Personally, I side with the former perspective.The widespread adoption of English has numerous benefits that cannot be ignored. Firstly, it facilitates communication between nations and cultures, making international interactions more convenient. In my country, English is a compulsory subject from elementary school onwards, making it easier for students to study abroad, which has become a popular trend among young people. As a result, language barriers are no longer a hindrance, leading to increased mutual understanding and trust between their home country and the host nation. This, in turn, strengthens relationships and boosts international trade. Additionally, researchers, particularly those in high-tech fields, have access to a broader range of references if they are proficient in English. For instance, cutting-edge technical research is predominantly published in English, making it essential for experts to be proficient in the language to stay updated.Although critics may argue that the rise of English is causing lesser-known languages to disappear, leading to the erosion of cultural heritage and national identity, I believe this perspective is short-sighted. It overlooks the rapid progress of native economies and societies. The benefits of a globally accepted language like English far outweigh the costs.In conclusion, despite some negative consequences, I am convinced that the pervasive use of English brings numerous benefits to individuals and countries worldwide. I strongly recommend that young people learn English, given its crucial role in globalization. Nevertheless, measures such as documentation and preservation efforts can be taken to protect native languages and cultures, ensuring that they continue to thrive in the face of a increasingly interconnected world.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";"The ability to think outside the box is what defines creativity. However, many governments impose limitations on the artistic expressions of innovative thinkers. Creativity flourishes in a mind that is free from constraints. Therefore, creative artists should be allowed to express their ideas without any restrictions or censorship.Throughout history, visionary artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, and Shakespeare have created works that conveyed powerful social messages. From sculptures to paintings, literature to drama and film, these artistic expressions have reflected the social issues of their respective eras, raising awareness and promoting social change. Creative works have the power to inspire reflection and self-examination, encouraging people to think critically about the world around them.Moreover, innovative art has the ability to address social issues in a peaceful and thought-provoking manner, allowing people to contemplate their own values and principles. It also provides a platform to criticize governmental wrongdoing and bring attention to important issues. For example, the Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin faced accusations of acting against the government simply for highlighting a social concern. Such reactions create obstacles for creative minds to flourish. Additionally, creativity has the power to bring aesthetic charm and beauty to our lives.Regrettably, many governments restrict artistic freedom. As Frank Zappa once said, ""The mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if it's not open."" Restrictions stifle innovative ideas and limit the potential of artists. Like the media, artists should be granted the freedom to express themselves without fear of censorship or retribution.Nevertheless, artists must also exercise self-awareness and responsibility, avoiding works that may hurt or offend the sentiments of others. Many artists have been embroiled in controversies due to their insensitive or provocative creations, which can harm social or religious beliefs. Artists should strive to create works that serve a purpose and promote positive change.In conclusion, I strongly believe that artists should be granted the freedom to express themselves. A mind that is confined and restricted cannot truly create or innovate. Imagination thrives when the mind is free from fear and constraints, allowing creativity to reach its full potential."
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;In today's society, cut-throat competition is rampant, sparking a debate about the best approach to success. While some argue that competing is the key to achieving goals, others believe that a co-operative approach is essential for a child's development into a responsible adult with strong moral values and a supportive social network.Co-operation is vital for teamwork, and educational systems recognize its importance by encouraging children to work together towards common goals. In a social setup, mutual help and sharing are crucial for success, as no one person can accomplish everything alone. For example, lions demonstrate the power of teamwork when they hunt together, making tasks easier and increasing their success rate. Similarly, a co-operative approach can save time, energy, and lead to higher success rates.Moreover, co-operation allows individuals to understand different perspectives, learn from others' mistakes, and identify their own strengths and weaknesses. It can also inspire and motivate people by showcasing others' achievements. However, competition is equally important as it drives improvement and evolution. The development of science and technology, for instance, has been fueled by competition. Companies continually strive to outdo each other, resulting in innovations like more efficient cars, which provide customers with a wider range of options.It's essential to note, though, that the concept of competition has been distorted. Instead of competing against others, individuals should focus on surpassing their own previous achievements. Unhealthy, selfish competition, where one person's gain comes at the expense of another, is detrimental in the long run. Competition should be based on self-improvement, aiming to elevate one's own performance above others in a healthy, constructive manner.Ultimately, competition and co-operation are intertwined, like two sides of the same coin. They cannot be separated, and a balance between the two is necessary for achieving success. I strongly believe that children should be taught the value of co-operation, complemented with healthy competition, and made aware of the pitfalls of selfish competition. By embracing both co-operation and healthy competition, individuals can more easily attain success, recognition, and their goals.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"Crime is always punishable, and retribution is the primary method of countering criminals.

To mitigate this risk, the jury must carefully consider the circumstances surrounding the crime. For instance, if an individual commits murder in self-defense, such an act is not considered heinous. Only those who intentionally commit hateful crimes with a clear understanding of their actions should be subject to capital punishment.In conclusion, capital punishment is essential for controlling violence in society. I firmly believe that individuals who lack empathy for human life, such as psychopaths and terrorists, deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment effectively safeguards human rights in a strict and efficient manner.

59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;Taking a break from studies between high school and university is a common practice in some countries, while in others it is viewed as a waste of time. However, a one-year break can be beneficial for young people after completing high school. Typically, students study continuously from the age of 5 to 16, which can lead to mental exhaustion. A one-year break can provide a much-needed respite, allowing young minds to recharge and refocus. This break can be utilized to travel, pursue hobbies, or simply relax, enabling students to approach their university studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm.Moreover, a break after high school can help students discover their field of interest and gain professional experience through work or internships. This period can also be used to save money for university tuition fees or prepare for a desired course. Nevertheless, there are potential drawbacks to consider. A break can disrupt a student's focus, leading to a loss of momentum and motivation. Some students may become complacent with their earnings and lose sight of their academic goals. Additionally, they may engage in unhealthy habits, such as smoking or drinking.Despite these risks, a break can be beneficial if utilized wisely. It is essential to recognize that each individual is unique, and the decision to take a break should be optional. The primary objective of education is to nurture young minds, not to force them into a rigid academic schedule. Countries like India, where a break is stigmatized, should reconsider their stance and acknowledge the value of giving young minds a chance to rest and prepare for the challenges of higher education and life. A one-year break can provide young people with the opportunity to recharge, reflect, and gear up for the academic and professional demands that lie ahead.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";"The computer, a revolutionary device, has transformed human life in unprecedented ways. Since its invention by Charles Babbage, known as the ""Father of Computers,"" the development of computers has been relentless. The world has become heavily reliant on computers, and their absence would catapult us back in time by centuries.In the modern era, computers are omnipresent, playing a crucial role in every aspect of life. From navigating aircraft to sending simple documents, computers are indispensable. They are utilized in space exploration, warfare, healthcare, education, and numerous other fields. Computers have simplified human life, making it more convenient, efficient, and swift. For instance, sending a message to someone in another country, which once took months, can now be accomplished in mere minutes through email and a few clicks. Computers offer unparalleled speed, enhanced efficiency, accuracy, precision, and productivity, among countless other benefits.The future prospects of computers are exceedingly promising. From their initial massive size, equivalent to that of a room, they have been miniaturized to fit in the palm of one's hand. Nanotechnology is pushing the boundaries further, aiming to develop computers at microscopic levels. Research is also underway to create computer-controlled drone soldiers. The evolution of computers is endless, with no foreseeable limitations.However, like any technology, computers have their downsides. They have made humans overly dependent, and issues like virus attacks, privacy breaches, data leaks, cyber assaults, identity theft, and frauds are prevalent. Computers also expose children to inappropriate content and have encroached upon human mental health, as seen in conditions like Facebook Addiction Disorder (FAD). Furthermore, computers have invaded our private lives to the extent that satellites can surveil our homes and personal lives, as exemplified by the Wikileaks incident, which highlighted the dangers of computer-mediated data leaks.Despite these drawbacks, computers have also provided security and sophistication. Therefore, dependence on computers is not inherently negative. It is essential, however, to be aware of both the advantages and disadvantages and to be cautious of malicious activities. The invention of the computer was intended to benefit mankind, and it has successfully fulfilled this objective. Given the integral role computers play in modern life, it is unimaginable to envision a life without them, making it essential to adapt to their presence while being mindful of their implications."
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The development of the world relies heavily on education, and a crucial aspect of this is whether universities should maintain a balanced ratio of male and female students in their courses. While this is a topic of debate, it's essential to recognize that both genders are equally vital and should therefore be given equal opportunities. This means that universities should strive to admit males and females in equal numbers, based on their individual choices and merits.Education is a fundamental human right, applicable to both men and women. The global aim of empowering women can only be achieved by providing them with opportunities equal to those of men. When universities embrace equal admissions, both genders can develop their talents in a healthy, competitive environment. This not only fosters personal growth but also prepares individuals for the challenges of the future, contributing to societal development in the long term.Co-education, where males and females learn together, plays a significant role in helping both genders interact comfortably with each other. It teaches them how to cooperate, behave, and work together effectively. For instance, students in single-sex schools often lack the social skills to interact with the opposite sex, leading to shyness or awkwardness. Co-educational settings help overcome these shortcomings, promoting a more balanced and prepared society.Unfortunately, gender biases still exist, with some individuals believing that women are less capable in certain fields such as mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. This biased approach hinders societal progress. History has repeatedly shown that women are equally capable, with figures like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, and Marie Curie exemplifying women's intelligence and skill across various disciplines.In conclusion, I firmly advocate for equal rights for both genders in education, with universities admitting students based on merit and choice, regardless of gender. Equality in education is pivotal for societal development, as both males and females are essential pillars of society, neither superior nor inferior. The choice of educational path should be based on individual merit and interest, with educational rights being universally accessible.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;In today's world, few issues are as universally relevant as cooking, as it plays a significant role in everyone's daily life. While some people believe that a considerable amount of time should be dedicated to cooking, I firmly think that people are inclined to spend less time in the kitchen. There are several reasons that support my perspective, with two key arguments standing out.Firstly, the advancement of science and technology has led to the development of modern kitchen appliances, such as microwaves and advanced pressure cookers, which significantly reduce cooking time. As a result, people can now prepare a meal in under an hour, a notable decrease from the two to three hours it took just a decade ago. The benefits of these technologies have not gone unnoticed, with a growing number of people from all walks of life recognizing their value in simplifying household chores. This trend is expected to continue as science and technology progress, making it likely that spending less time on cooking will become the norm in the near future.Another reason is that many young people prefer dining out, opting to invest their time in work or studies to improve themselves. A recent survey revealed that 89% of individuals believe that, due to the pressures and competitions they face, they must dedicate a significant amount of time to working hard, updating their skills, and acquiring new ones. Consequently, they find it challenging to allocate time for cooking. Even when they have some spare time, they prefer to socialize with friends to unwind and alleviate work and study-related stress.Some might argue that investing considerable time in cooking ensures the nutritional value and quality of food for their families. While this holds some truth, it is essential to note that utilizing technology or advanced facilities does not compromise the nutritional value or quality of food. In fact, with the aid of ozone machines, harmful bacteria, mold spores, and pesticides in food can be eliminated, thereby safeguarding the health of consumers. Furthermore, with the high living standards of today, restaurants are under strict control and supervision by relevant authorities, ensuring that the quality of products meets stringent requirements. Therefore, it is relatively easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality without wasting excessive time.In conclusion, considering these factors, it becomes evident that there are compelling reasons to support my viewpoint. Based on the discussion above, I strongly affirm that people will indeed spend less time cooking food.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The role of games in children's development has been a crucial one, particularly in enhancing their skills. With the advancement of technology, children now have greater access to modern games. This has led to a debate about the relative importance of traditional and modern games in skill development. In my opinion, parents and educators should prioritize traditional games.While modern games may offer some benefits, such as improving computer skills and familiarity with the latest technology, they also have limitations. For instance, participating in online games can help children develop essential computer skills and keep them updated with the latest trends, which can be advantageous in their future careers. Moreover, modern games provide an opportunity for children to experience cutting-edge technology, fostering an appreciation for innovation.However, I firmly believe that traditional games are indispensable in the learning process, and their importance surpasses that of modern games, especially in today's society. A significant advantage of traditional games is their ability to foster communication skills among children. Unlike modern games, which often involve interaction between children and machines, traditional games provide a platform for face-to-face interaction, allowing children to develop essential social skills like chatting, laughing, and cooperating with peers. As a result, children who engage in traditional games are more likely to become adept at communicating with people from diverse backgrounds.Furthermore, traditional games have inherent educational value, having been meticulously designed by educators to enhance various skills in children. These games have a proven track record of effectiveness in previous teaching practices. In contrast, modern games are primarily developed by game companies with profit as their main objective. This poses a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy content, such as violence or inappropriate material, included in these games for the sake of financial gain.In conclusion, with the rise of modern games, traditional games should not be overlooked by parents and educators. Traditional games offer a positive and healthy environment for skill development, ensuring that children learn essential skills in a beneficial and secure manner.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The efficient allocation of government budgets has long been a topic of debate among the public. Lately, there has been a growing argument that governments should prioritize investments in healthcare and education over entertainment or sports facilities. In my opinion, this proposal offers significant benefits to society as a whole.Addressing the needs of thousands of citizens who are struggling with illnesses or lack of education is more pressing and practical than constructing theaters or sports stadiums. In reality, an uneducated individual may not fully appreciate the arts, while a person with untreated medical conditions may be unable to participate in sports. Therefore, providing healthcare and education should be the government's top priority.Entertainment facilities like cinemas, theaters, and sports stadiums are primarily driven by profit. Their existence depends on marketing strategies, facility conditions, and audience numbers, with competition among them being an inherent part of a free market that should not be interfered with by the government. In contrast, the establishment of healthcare facilities or educational institutions aims to enhance health and education standards, not to generate profits, which is why they deserve more government funding.Moreover, using taxpayers' money to build theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot utilize them. For instance, not everyone enjoys watching live performances. Thus, it's somewhat inappropriate to use the majority's tax funds to cater to the needs of a minority. This is why sectors like healthcare and education warrant more government support, as they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.In conclusion, I firmly believe that government budgets should be allocated more towards healthcare and education rather than entertainment facilities, because these sectors are more essential, non-profit oriented, and accessible to the majority of citizens.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;In the 21st century, there is a widespread belief that technology is the primary driver of productivity. As a result, countries have been actively promoting technological advancements in recent years, despite potential drawbacks. Some individuals are concerned that modern technology may hinder the preservation of traditional techniques and ways of life. However, I disagree with this notion and believe that technology actually plays a crucial role in promoting and preserving traditional methods.From a logistical standpoint, technology has made it more efficient and effective to showcase traditional skills and lifestyles. In the past, people had to physically visit a location to experience traditional practices, which was often impossible for those with busy schedules or limited by transportation. But with the advent of the internet, one of the most significant innovations in modern society, people can now access and appreciate traditional techniques online at any time and from any location.Furthermore, technology has enhanced the presentation of traditional cultural heritage, making it more engaging and appealing. For instance, China successfully promoted traditional techniques at the Shanghai World Expo by utilizing state-of-the-art technologies such as robots and LED screens. This blend of modern technology and traditional culture left a lasting impression on tourists from around the world.Some people argue that technology may have a negative impact on traditional lifestyles, claiming that individuals, particularly young people, are more interested in new and advanced technologies, such as digital products, and are thus becoming disenchanted with traditional techniques. However, I believe this is not a significant concern, as there is a current trend of people returning to traditional practices.In conclusion, I firmly believe that technology supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. The integration of traditional culture with modern technology is essential for its long-term development. By embracing technology, we can ensure the continued appreciation and preservation of traditional methods, rather than letting them fade away.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The presence of innovative artists brings joy and inspiration to our often mundane lives. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that artists have been granted too much freedom and power, and that government intervention is necessary to restrict their creative expression. In my opinion, the freedom to express thoughts and ideas should always be celebrated, and it is unjust to impose limitations on an artist's creative will.One of the primary concerns about giving artists complete creative freedom stems from the fear of social manipulation, which could destabilize society. However, I believe that audiences possess their own judgment and are unlikely to be misled or influenced by artwork. It is worth noting that art inherently involves imagination, exaggeration, and sometimes fabrication. Regardless of whether a piece of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's responsibility to interpret its meaning. If the art depicts unreality, the audience is capable of recognizing its untruthfulness and appreciating its artistic value. On the other hand, if the art reflects reality, what would be the intention behind banning it, unless it is to conceal an unpleasant truth? Would it not be autocratic for the government to suppress artists who reveal the truth? In essence, the fear of social manipulation is unwarranted.Let us examine the impact of art on individuals. It is undeniable that some artwork may contain negative implications, such as insanity, violence, or eroticism. I agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents are necessary, as they may not be mature enough to distinguish between what is acceptable and what is not. However, when it comes to adult audiences, there is no need for censorship – these negative aspects exist in the world, and it is unlikely that adults would be brainwashed solely due to some creative artwork.In conclusion, I do not support the idea of imposing restrictions on artists' work. On the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas, as this world needs them to add color and vibrancy to our lives. Artists play a vital role in making our world a more interesting and thought-provoking place, and their creative freedom should be preserved and celebrated.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The escalating crime rate has prompted calls for the government to intervene and regulate the depiction of violent scenes in the media. The media often portrays violence in an extreme and sensationalized manner to attract viewers, which can have a detrimental impact on young and impressionable audiences. Without proper parental guidance and the ability to distinguish right from wrong, these individuals may emulate violent behaviors and commit real-life crimes, perceiving violence as justified and acceptable.On the other hand, the media, including TV and film, is considered a reliable source of information, regulated by the government, and is expected to report and reflect real-world phenomena. While violence is an unfortunate reality that must be reported, excessive depiction of violence can mislead the public and have a negative influence on society. Recent news reports, such as the tragic case of a 17-year-old boy who killed his family members out of hatred and jealousy, illustrate the potential consequences of excessive exposure to violence. In reality, people may resort to extreme measures to solve minor problems due to desensitization caused by excessive violence exposure.It is undeniable that our society is currently saturated with violent scenes and plots. To address this issue, the government must take immediate action to strengthen censorship and control the amount of violence in the media. Failure to do so may lead to a continuous rise in violent crime rates, ultimately resulting in a loss of control.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";"In recent times, we have seen significant transformations in many areas of life, including the feminist movement. Women now have more opportunities than ever before. In my opinion, this is a positive development in human society, contrary to what some people may think.Firstly, equality between men and women is essential in a developed society. The days when women were limited to household chores and childcare are behind us. Nowadays, women are more active and can be successful entrepreneurs, politicians, scientists, and more. This means that women, often perceived as the ""weaker"" sex, have the same rights and abilities as men to contribute to human progress, and in some fields, they even outperform men.Secondly, the advancement of women's rights has brought numerous benefits to both women themselves and society as a whole. For example, the financial burden on families has decreased substantially with both spouses working and earning a living. Moreover, women have a natural talent for careers like healthcare and human resources, thanks to their patience and attention to detail.It is true that these changes have also led to some negative consequences, such as an increase in divorce rates or the challenge women face in balancing work and traditional family responsibilities. Additionally, children may receive less attention from their parents, who are both busy with their careers. However, every aspect of life has its advantages and disadvantages, and women should find ways to overcome these challenges.Overall, a society that provides women with equal opportunities to men will undoubtedly reap numerous benefits that outweigh the obstacles."
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";As we consume media, such as newspapers and TV, we are constantly reminded of environmental issues like traffic congestion, air and water pollution. To tackle these problems, concrete actions must be taken. Although increasing petrol prices is a strategy that has been proposed in modern society as a potential solution, its impact is limited in addressing the far-reaching consequences of pollution and traffic issues.Price control mechanisms have been successfully applied in various sectors, including agriculture and real estate. However, their effectiveness in alleviating traffic and pollution pressures is questionable. From a macroeconomic perspective, governments face challenges in adjusting prices to meet social demands, making it difficult to implement immediate price increases. Moreover, pollution is caused by a multitude of factors, including the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, and excessive lighting, which collectively contribute to significant environmental degradation. Additionally, the acceleration of work pace, resulting in increased traffic during rush hours, also plays a role.As previously discussed, a multifaceted approach is necessary to mitigate pollution and traffic problems. Firstly, authorities should prioritize enhancing public transportation infrastructure, such as expanding bus lines, to discourage the use of private vehicles. Secondly, temporary targets should be established to limit pollutant emissions within a specific timeframe, such as a season. Supervisory institutions should also be established to identify and address problems. Furthermore, fostering a sense of environmental responsibility, although it may not yield immediate results, is a prudent long-term strategy.In conclusion, solely relying on increasing oil prices to address pollution and traffic issues is inadequate. Instead, improving transportation facilities, establishing supervisory institutions, and raising environmental awareness are more effective approaches to tackling these complex problems.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The advertising industry has never been as advanced as it is in today's society, but this has also led to some negative perceptions among the public due to the spread of exaggerated and false information. As a result, there is ongoing debate about whether all advertisements should be banned. In my opinion, while some advertisements can be disturbing, it is essential to acknowledge the benefits they bring.Firstly, it would be unfair to restrict public service advertisements that are creative and inspiring, as their purpose is not to generate profits but to disseminate valuable culture, promote good moral traits, and raise awareness and support for the disabled and the poor.Additionally, advertising a brand image or product through mass media can significantly boost sales for companies, which in turn can stimulate household spending and contribute to the economic development of the country as a whole. Recent studies have shown that launching an advertising campaign can increase sales revenue by 40%, demonstrating the positive impact of advertising on the economy.However, it is important to acknowledge that advertisements also have their downsides. The costs of advertising can lead to higher product prices, and some advertisements do spread false information, creating an information imbalance between consumers and companies. Nevertheless, the benefits of advertising outweigh these drawbacks.In conclusion, advertisements have a social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. It is not reasonable to completely deny the value of all advertisements. Nevertheless, if advertisements with exaggerated and false information could be banned, the overall perception and acceptance of advertising would likely improve.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;In today's fast-paced world, people often encounter numerous challenges that can lead to significant stress. As a result, it is essential for individuals to find effective ways to unwind and relax. While different people may employ various strategies to cope with stress, such as reading, watching movies, or gardening, I firmly believe that engaging in various forms of exercise is the most effective method for reducing stress in modern society. Exercise not only improves physical health but also fosters positive emotions and mental well-being.It is no surprise that exercise plays a vital role in enhancing physical health. Engaging in sports like jogging, swimming, or playing basketball can effectively improve the human respiratory and circulatory systems. Additionally, these activities can strengthen muscles and reduce excess body fat, which is particularly important given the rising prevalence of obesity in recent years. Many studies have highlighted the alarming increase in overweight individuals in developed countries, primarily due to a lack of regular exercise.Exercise also has a profound impact on mental health. When people engage in physical activity, their brain's neuron cells release dopamine, a chemical compound that induces feelings of pleasure and delight. This can help alleviate the burden of stress and anxiety, enabling individuals to tackle challenging problems and tasks with renewed confidence and determination. Furthermore, rigorous exercise can also refine one's willpower, allowing people to approach difficult situations with a more positive and resilient mindset.In conclusion, while various activities can help people relax, I strongly argue that exercise is the most effective way to mitigate stress, offering benefits that extend beyond physical health to mental well-being as well.
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"The adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" has been a long-standing maxim, highlighting the significant impact of images in conveying messages, ideas, and opinions to the masses. While images are a powerful tool for communication, the importance of the written word cannot be overstated, as it remains a widely used means of expression. Therefore, I only partially agree that images are a more effective means of communication in today's world.On one hand, images have the ability to shape public perception and influence thoughts. For instance, the graphic images displayed on cigarette packaging serve as a deterrent, illustrating the harmful consequences of smoking, and have contributed to a slight decline in smoking rates. Moreover, Kevin Carter's haunting photograph of a starving Sudanese child highlighted the plight of Sudan's citizens, demonstrating the significant impact of images in raising awareness. Images are also ubiquitous in newspapers, magazines, and advertisements, captivating the attention of a wide audience.On the other hand, written words are essential for conveying nuanced messages and providing context. Relying solely on images can lead to misinterpretation, as individuals may draw their own conclusions about the intended meaning. In contrast, written words provide clarity and explanation, facilitating a deeper understanding of the message. Furthermore, written words play a crucial role in education, with academic textbooks relying on a combination of images and text to guide readers towards comprehension.In conclusion, both images and words are interdependent, and it is impractical to emphasize one over the other. For effective communication, both elements must be utilized: images to illustrate and words to describe a particular subject. By striking a balance between these two components, we can convey messages with greater clarity, precision, and impact."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;It is undeniable that languages are disappearing at an alarming rate worldwide. In response, some people advocate for governments to allocate funds to preserve these languages. However, others are skeptical about the feasibility of such efforts. In my opinion, this viewpoint warrants a thorough examination, and this essay will delve into this issue.Firstly, it is evident that languages, particularly oral languages, are an integral part of a country's cultural heritage. They facilitate distinction between nations and regions within a country. The loss of a minority language entails the erosion of a nation's traditional customs, habits, and cultural identity. Governments should invest in preserving these cultural assets to maintain the rich diversity of cultures that makes our world more fascinating. Moreover, a country with a rich cultural heritage can take pride in its unique identity, which can foster a deeper sense of patriotism and national loyalty among its citizens.On the other hand, there are drawbacks to preserving minority languages. Despite government investment, it is challenging to achieve desirable outcomes. For instance, many young people, in particular, show little interest in learning and studying these languages, which are often complex and unpopular. Furthermore, the preservation process requires a significant amount of time to collect, restore, and train educators. If not done diligently, these efforts can be futile and result in a waste of resources.In conclusion, I firmly believe that all languages should be preserved and developed to the greatest extent possible. Collective efforts from individuals and governments are necessary to achieve this goal, with governments playing a crucial role in promoting and supporting language preservation initiatives.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;In my opinion, the government should prioritize investing in basic social welfare programs, such as education and housing, over subsidizing arts programs. Education is a more critical determinant of quality of life than art, as it has a direct impact on people's well-being and opportunities. To improve people's lives, governments should focus on providing fundamental support, such as scholarships, to ensure that all citizens have access to quality education. This is because knowledge and wisdom are essential for personal growth and a well-rounded social system.While art can certainly enrich our daily lives, providing a welcome respite from the pressures of study and work, its importance pales in comparison to more pressing issues, such as housing shortages, which affect many low-income families in developing countries. In these countries, where basic needs are not being met, the pursuit of art seems like a luxury that cannot be afforded.In conclusion, while art can play a role in enhancing the quality of life, I believe that governments should give greater weight to more pressing social issues, such as education and housing. These are the essential foundations upon which a decent life is built, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure that these basic needs are met before investing in more discretionary programs like the arts.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;Despite the advancements of modern society, access to healthcare and education remain fundamental rights of citizens. A highly debated topic is whether the government should be responsible for providing these essential services to its citizens.Proponents of government-funded healthcare and education argue that it is the government's obligation to ensure citizens have access to these basic necessities. As the leader of society, the government should create a harmonious and stable environment, which includes providing healthcare and education. Without these, citizens' physical and mental well-being would be at risk, leading to decreased productivity and potentially destabilizing the industry. Moreover, lack of education and guidance could lead to misbehavior, crime, and threats to public safety. Therefore, the government should be accountable for providing healthcare and education to maintain a safe and stable society.On the other hand, opponents argue that government subsidies for healthcare and education would be a waste of public funds, as many individuals have the means to pay for these services privately. Instead, the government should prioritize more pressing issues, such as high crime rates, the AIDS epidemic, or infrastructure shortages, which require significant financial resources to address.In my opinion, the government should provide healthcare and education to those who are most in need, namely the underprivileged. Meanwhile, citizens who can afford these services should encourage the government to allocate funds to more urgent areas. Ultimately, creating a harmonious society requires a collaborative effort between the government and its citizens.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;Children often visit zoos to see various types of wild animals. However, when it comes to the existence of zoos in modern society, animal rights activists strongly argue that wildlife belongs in its natural habitat and that zoos should be abolished. I disagree with this viewpoint, as zoos provide invaluable benefits in terms of animal conservation and education for children.It is undeniable that our environment is deteriorating daily due to the excessive pursuit of economic development at the expense of the ecosystem, posing a significant threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoos offer a viable alternative for protecting animals, as specialized staff can provide better care and protection. If an animal falls ill, a professional veterinarian can provide prompt treatment. Thanks to this thoughtful care, the diversity of wild animals can be ensured.Moreover, zoos provide a platform for educating teenagers and promoting eco-friendly behavior towards animals. Although the animals are enclosed, they still have the ability to roam in a limited area. When children visit zoos, they can observe the eating habits and leisure activities of animals, enriching their knowledge about different species. Furthermore, children can acquire information on how to protect wild animals through guided tours or interactions with volunteers.On the other hand, criticisms about the drawbacks of zoos are common. It is true that some zoos lack systematic management, leading to the death of wild animals due to food shortages. Additionally, being confined in zoos for extended periods can cause wildlife to lose their ability to survive in nature, where competition among animals is fierce.In my opinion, zoos offer a man-made environment that can prolong the lifespan of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting them. To improve, zoos should focus on enhancing their management systems and utilizing their income wisely to better conserve wild animals. By doing so, zoos can continue to provide a valuable service in promoting animal conservation and education, while also ensuring the well-being of the animals in their care.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;Many countries have successfully driven their economies forward by developing national industries. However, there is a growing concern that the economic goals of industrialized nations may come at the cost of harming the environment. In my opinion, I firmly believe that a thriving economy and environmental preservation can go hand in hand.It is true that some countries may prioritize economic growth over environmental protection, resulting in the degradation of their local environments. These countries often lack the necessary financial and human resources, advanced technologies, and expertise, forcing them to rely heavily on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Additionally, people in impoverished areas may not have the knowledge or awareness to preserve ecosystems, leading to the unchecked and reckless exploitation of local resources, which can put a significant strain on the environment. From this perspective, economic development and environmental protection may seem to be conflicting goals.However, I strongly believe that a booming economy can be closely tied to environmental preservation. As people become more aware of the importance of a green economy, products that are free from pollutants are gaining popularity among consumers, allowing eco-friendly businesses to thrive and drive sales. For instance, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy sources have gained immense popularity in recent years.Moreover, taking environmental consequences seriously can also lead to increased efficiency and productivity. If a company is environmentally conscious, it will likely optimize its resource usage, leading to improved production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity and spur economic growth. On the other hand, without environmental considerations, companies would continue to consume large amounts of energy, resulting in high operational costs that hinder economic development.In conclusion, I firmly believe that thriving economies and environmental preservation can be promoted simultaneously. Moreover, I think that developed countries should provide financial resources, technologies, and expertise to support underdeveloped areas, enabling them to effectively alleviate environmental problems. By doing so, we can ensure a sustainable future where economic growth and environmental protection go hand in hand.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;In recent years, there has been a growing trend of people becoming more aware of their democratic rights, and as a result, they are taking a greater interest in how the government allocates tax expenditures. Some individuals have suggested that tax money should be diverted from arts to public services that benefit the community. However, I firmly believe that arts should also be a priority in the government's investment portfolio.It is undeniable that the government has a responsibility to prioritize public services and facilities, as these are essential for maintaining social stability and safety. The government has a leadership role to play in ensuring that tax money is utilized effectively to meet the basic needs of citizens, including access to education and healthcare. By doing so, it can create a sense of comfort and security among the population, which in turn can lead to a reduction in crime rates. Therefore, it is crucial that public services and facilities receive adequate attention from the authorities.On the other hand, I strongly argue that arts should not be neglected by the government. Arts have the power to enrich people's cultural lives and provide a much-needed respite from the pressures of daily life. In today's competitive world, individuals are often overwhelmed with work and study commitments, and arts offer a vital outlet for relaxation and stress relief. Without access to arts, people may be at risk of developing psychological problems.Moreover, from a local community perspective, investing in arts can have numerous benefits for cultural and economic development. Arts are closely tied to cultural heritage, and preserving local arts can help promote the preservation of cultural heritage, fostering a sense of belonging among local residents and contributing to the growth of the local tourism industry. In this sense, arts serve both cultural and economic purposes.In conclusion, while public services and facilities are indeed a crucial part of government expenditure, I believe that the authorities should also recognize the value of arts, which offer numerous individual and social benefits. By striking a balance between these two priorities, the government can ensure that tax money is allocated in a way that promotes the well-being and prosperity of citizens.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;Since their inception, zoos have been a subject of both support and criticism. While some people view zoos as entertaining and ecologically significant, others condemn the practice of keeping animals in captivity. This discussion will examine both perspectives before drawing a reasonable conclusion.On one hand, critics of zoos argue that keeping animals in captivity is morally wrong, as they believe animals should be considered non-human persons with the right to freedom. They argue that removing animals from their natural habitats and confining them to small enclosures is unfair. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that many zoos, particularly those in developing countries, fail to provide adequate care and attention to their animals. As a result, animals often suffer from malnutrition and inadequate medical treatment. Furthermore, animals from warm climates are sometimes forced to endure harsh European winters.On the other hand, proponents of zoos contend that they offer the public a unique form of entertainment while also contributing to the preservation of ecological balance. Many people, especially children, enjoy visiting zoos to see their favorite animals, observe newborns, and learn about species from around the world. Zoos provide valuable educational information about the lives of various animals, and they play a crucial role in conserving endangered species and preventing their extinction. By simulating natural habitats and protecting animals from predators and hunters, zoos help maintain the balance of nature.In conclusion, both arguments have valid points, but in my opinion, the benefits of zoos outweigh the drawbacks. Nevertheless, it is essential that zoos improve their standards to ensure that animals receive proper care and attention. By doing so, zoos can continue to provide entertainment, education, and conservation while also upholding the welfare of the animals in their care.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;"The freedom to express oneself is a fundamental right that artists in most countries are granted. However, there are those who argue that government restrictions are necessary to limit their opinions. I partially agree with this sentiment, but ultimately believe that artists should be given the liberty to create, as this is essential for producing truly remarkable works of art.Firstly, imposing control over artists' ideas would inevitably stifle their creativity in the long run. When given the opportunity to express themselves freely, most artists will think outside the box and create extraordinary works of art, such as paintings or movies. The paintings of Da Vinci and Michelangelo, for example, continue to be admired to this day, precisely because they were not restricted during their time. In essence, the absence of limitations will lead to more awe-inspiring work from artists.Moreover, it is every individual's right to voice their opinions in any manner, as long as they do not harm the nation. Many countries strive to demonstrate their democratic credentials, and art is a powerful means of critiquing social problems and government policies. The film ""3 Idiots,"" starring Amir Khan, is a prime example of this, as it critiques the education system's emphasis on memorization over practical application. Therefore, restricting artists' freedom of expression would be a violation of their human rights.From another perspective, there are potential drawbacks to giving artists complete freedom. They may delve into sensitive topics that could spark controversy and chaos in a country. For instance, in a multiracial country like Malaysia, where citizens coexist in harmony, an artist who raises sensitive issues about a particular race in their work could create social unrest. Nevertheless, I believe that artists are well aware of their boundaries and would not intentionally engage in reckless behavior that could tarnish their reputation.In conclusion, it is clear that there should be no restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely provides them with the opportunity to express themselves naturally, without limitations. While freedom of expression can have negative consequences, I firmly believe that the numerous wonderful and beautiful works of art that result from this freedom outweigh the potential drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the absence of restrictions on artists, enabling them to create works that inspire and enrich society."
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;The use of advertising through various media outlets, such as newspapers, radio, and television, has become ubiquitous in today's society, leading many to believe that it is a necessary component. Opinions on advertising are divided, with some viewing it as a beneficial activity that improves lives, while others hold a contrasting perspective. This essay will examine both viewpoints before drawing a reasonable conclusion.On one hand, advertising is primarily used to promote products and services, encouraging consumption and driving sales. For businesses, advertisements are crucial for increasing revenue and profits. Additionally, advertising provides consumers with valuable information, enabling them to make informed decisions. For instance, customers of telecommunication services can compare offers from different companies, making it easier to choose the best internet or mobile phone plans. This perspective suggests that advertising has a positive impact on daily life, garnering significant support.On the other hand, some argue that advertising has negative consequences. One major concern is the proliferation of spam, where automated systems send numerous advertisements to personal phones or email addresses, causing discomfort and annoyance. Furthermore, advertising can be costly, and not all campaigns yield successful results, leading many to believe that advertising is a financial burden for businesses.In conclusion, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of advertising, it is clear that both perspectives have valid arguments. However, it appears that the benefits of advertising outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, the notion that advertising is a positive aspect of life is more convincing, and its importance in today's society is reaffirmed.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The issue of nuclear technology is a highly contentious one, with proponents arguing that it provides an efficient and economical source of energy, while opponents claim that it is inherently uncontrollable and perilous. Personally, I align with the latter group, who are skeptical about the benefits of nuclear power. In my opinion, the drawbacks of nuclear technology far outweigh its advantages, and I have several compelling reasons to support this stance.Firstly, the pursuit of nuclear technology inevitably leads to the development of atomic weapons. The devastating consequences of such weapons were starkly evident in the last century, and the risk of countries attempting to harness nuclear power for military purposes is a very real one. If multiple nations were to develop nuclear capabilities, the risk of nuclear conflict would increase exponentially.Another significant concern is the inherent risk of radioactivity associated with even civilian uses of nuclear power. Recent events have starkly illustrated the potential dangers, as an earthquake triggered a leak of radioactive materials from a nuclear power plant, releasing tons of hazardous substances into the air. This unfortunate incident underscores the inevitability of accidents, no matter how stringent the safety protocols may be.Furthermore, the generation of energy from nuclear sources is accompanied by the problem of nuclear waste disposal. This is a daunting task, as nuclear waste is exponentially more lethal to the environment than other hazardous materials. Despite efforts to find a solution, a permanent and safe method for disposing of nuclear waste remains elusive.In conclusion, while nuclear power may seem like a panacea for the global energy crisis, its disadvantages significantly outweigh its benefits. The risks associated with nuclear technology, including the potential for nuclear proliferation, radioactivity, and environmental degradation, make it an unacceptably hazardous option. Therefore, I firmly believe that the use of nuclear technology, even for civilian purposes, should be discouraged in favor of safer and more sustainable alternatives.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;The rising rate of unemployment has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that providing the unemployed with internet-enabled mobile phones is the most effective solution. Proponents of this approach believe that it is the best way to utilize public funds. However, I only partially agree with this solution, as I think giving mobile phones to the unemployed could be a waste of money.On the positive side, mobile phones with internet access can be a valuable tool for job seekers. They can browse online job listings, such as those found on The Star Online's job section, and research potential employers. The internet can also facilitate preparation for job applications and interviews. Additionally, mobile phones enable users to make calls to prospective employers, increasing their chances of finding employment. In essence, providing mobile phones to the unemployed could empower them to find work and become self-sufficient.On the other hand, supplying mobile phones to the unemployed may be a misguided use of taxpayer money. The funds allocated for this purpose could be better spent on other public amenities or distributed to those in need, allowing them to earn a living. Alternative uses for the money could have a more significant impact on the community. Moreover, offering free mobile phones could create an incentive for people to claim unemployment benefits falsely, taking advantage of the system and wasting public resources. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to support the effectiveness of this approach in reducing unemployment.In conclusion, providing internet-enabled mobile phones to the unemployed is not a viable solution to mitigate unemployment. I recommend that the government conduct thorough background checks on individuals before distributing mobile phones. It is essential to utilize public funds for the greater good of society, rather than squandering them on those who are not willing to put in the effort to find employment. A more thoughtful and targeted approach is necessary to address the complex issue of unemployment.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras has become ubiquitous in various settings, including schools, businesses, and other establishments, where they are employed to monitor activities. The benefits of CCTV cameras, particularly in reducing crime and protecting employees, are undeniable. However, some individuals argue that these cameras infringe upon their privacy due to the constant surveillance. Despite this, I firmly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every establishment to combat the rising theft rate and safeguard workers in the workplace.Firstly, the presence of CCTV cameras in the workplace can significantly reduce crimes such as robbery. The footage captured by these cameras serves as valuable evidence to aid in tracing and apprehending thieves. For instance, in Malaysia, the police successfully utilized CCTV footage to track and apprehend a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during midnight. Moreover, the knowledge that they are under constant surveillance can deter employees from engaging in theft, thereby minimizing crime rates. It is evident that CCTV cameras are essential in all workplaces to reduce crime.Furthermore, in some offices, employees often interact with irate or frustrated customers, which can sometimes put them in physical danger. The installation of CCTV cameras can provide employees with a sense of security, as customers are aware that their conversations are being recorded. In the event of an altercation, the videotapes can be used to determine the sequence of events, and subsequent actions can be taken. In essence, these cameras offer a form of protection to workers against potentially aggressive customers.From a different perspective, the use of CCTV cameras is not without controversy. Opponents of the system feel that their privacy is compromised due to the constant monitoring. However, it is crucial to recognize that safety takes precedence over privacy, and prevention is always preferable to dealing with the consequences of crime. Therefore, those opposing the system should strive to understand the situation and take proactive measures to prevent themselves from becoming victims of crime.In conclusion, CCTV cameras are indispensable and should be installed in every establishment, primarily to protect individuals from harm by intruders or robbers. Although the use of these cameras may result in a loss of privacy, safety should be the top priority to ensure personal security.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;Nowadays, it is possible to live anywhere in the world, but there are still some differences between locations. From my perspective, big cities can be a great place to raise children.To start with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities compared to the countryside. For example, in my country, the best schools, universities, and institutes are located in cities, and education is one of the most important aspects of a child's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to spend their early years in cities.Additionally, it is widely acknowledged that a large number of recreational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have access to a wide range of entertainment options, such as playgrounds, parks, science museums, and cinemas. In contrast, the countryside often lacks such facilities, and children there often spend their free time on farms.Finally, in big cities, children have easy access to media, which enables them to learn a lot by watching television and browsing the internet. Through the internet, they can connect with other children from around the world, exchange knowledge, and learn about different cultures.In conclusion, although the countryside has its advantages, such as fresh air and peace, children today need stimulation and activities to occupy their leisure time in a meaningful way. Big cities can provide the necessary infrastructure and resources to support a child's development and entertainment, making them a suitable place for raising children.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";There are numerous types of jobs in society, ranging from those offered by government-related companies to those provided by private companies. While both types of companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would personally prefer to be my own boss and have my own business. There are several benefits to working for oneself rather than for others.Firstly, private entrepreneurship offers a multitude of opportunities that are not available when working for someone else. As the boss of one's own business, individuals have the freedom to make their own decisions and are solely responsible for their tasks. This autonomy can be empowering, although it can also create stressful situations. Moreover, when individuals work for themselves, they retain the profits they generate, whereas in other jobs, the profits often go to managers or supervisors. Unfortunately, many employers today fail to share a fair portion of these profits with their workers, which I believe is unfair.Lastly, private businesses offer a level of autonomy that employees often crave when working for others. As one's own boss, an individual can set their own schedule, allowing for greater flexibility. This is particularly beneficial when unexpected events arise, such as illness, traffic jams, or the need for a vacation. In traditional employment settings, such situations often require requesting permission, which may not always be granted.While working for others undoubtedly has its advantages, I firmly believe that those who have their own businesses are generally more comfortable. They enjoy greater opportunities, profits, and autonomy, making entrepreneurship an appealing choice for many.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"Throughout their lives, many individuals encounter at least one failure in various areas, including education, relationships, and economics. Some people believe that the best way to deal with failure is to forget about it and move on; however, I strongly disagree with this approach. Instead, I firmly believe that a person who has experienced defeat should persist and continue trying until they achieve their goal.Firstly, when individuals face failure, they can learn valuable lessons from the experience, which enables them to avoid repeating the same mistakes in their next attempt. For instance, many inventors initially encounter problems and setbacks, but they learn from these experiences and develop strategies to overcome them in subsequent stages.Secondly, experience demonstrates that consistent effort and perseverance lead to increased expertise and ultimately, success. For example, scientists who experiment with a substance over an extended period gain extensive knowledge and experience, which eventually enables them to achieve a breakthrough.In conclusion, I argue that people should not give up when faced with failure. On the contrary, they should use the experience as an opportunity to learn and gain new insights, and with persistence and dedication, they will become more experienced and increase their chances of success."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;In today's world, many countries and nations are grappling with pressing issues, two of which stand out as particularly significant: the rapidly increasing population and the endangerment of plant and animal species. In my opinion, while endangered animals are crucial, human needs should take precedence.First and foremost, the world's population is growing by the day, which in turn increases the demand for food. To meet this demand, we require vast areas of farmland to cultivate crops like wheat and corn. It's undeniable that food is essential for human survival, and without it, people cannot sustain themselves for more than a few weeks. Consequently, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, humans need shelter to protect themselves from the elements, such as wind, floods, and wildlife. This necessitates the allocation of land for building houses. After food, shelter is one of the most fundamental human needs, and its importance cannot be overstated.Lastly, humans require various essential resources to sustain their lives, many of which are industrial in nature, such as medicine. Therefore, it's necessary to designate certain areas for industrial purposes. Modern life comes with its own set of challenges, which are mitigated by the comforts provided by industry.In conclusion, the population of endangered animals is significantly lower than that of humans, and therefore, they do not require as much land as people do. I firmly believe that, given the increasing population, human needs such as farmland, housing, and industry take precedence over preserving land for endangered animals.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";Every individual possesses two distinct characteristics: appearance and personality. In my opinion, while appearance is significant, personality takes precedence. It's impossible to accurately judge someone based solely on their physical appearance. Some people mistakenly believe that those with darker skin tones or a reserved demeanor are inherently bad, while those with lighter skin tones or a perpetual smile are inherently good. I strongly disagree with such superficial judgments.Firstly, it's essential to recognize that some individuals are adept at pretending to be someone they're not, deceiving others with their charming facade. For instance, some people may put on a cheerful and well-spoken exterior before marriage, only to reveal their true personality after the wedding. This highlights the importance of looking beyond one's appearance to truly understand their character.Secondly, it's crucial to acknowledge that physical appearance is not a reliable indicator of a person's worth or personality. People with darker skin tones, larger body types, or a more serious demeanor may still be exceptional individuals, worthy of friendship and respect. I recall a personal experience with a neighbor who embodied these characteristics. Initially, I was intimidated by her appearance, but when I found myself locked out of my house on a cold winter day, she took me in and showed me remarkable hospitality. Her behavior was truly unforgettable, and it taught me a valuable lesson: never judge someone based on their appearance.In conclusion, the most effective way to evaluate individuals is to get to know their personality, rather than their physical appearance. Unfortunately, many people masquerade as someone they're not, hiding their true nature behind a charming exterior. By looking beyond surface-level characteristics, we can foster more meaningful connections and avoid making misguided judgments about others.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The 21st century has been marked by the pervasive trend of globalization, sparking debates about the necessity of a single international language. In my opinion, a universal language is crucial for the global community, playing a vital role in facilitating communication and cooperation among people from diverse backgrounds.The importance of a single international language is particularly evident in the realm of global economic cooperation. When businessmen from different countries share a common language, they can communicate more effectively and engage in deeper discussions about trade, thereby intensifying transnational cooperation. Conversely, the absence of a shared language can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts during business negotiations, hindering collaboration. Thus, a single international language serves a significant economic purpose.Furthermore, a universal language is essential for cultural communication and exchange. Equipped with a shared language, people can effortlessly share information about their countries' unique cultures, such as traditional customs and modern lifestyles, broadening their perspectives and enabling them to view the world from new angles. For instance, when travelers visit foreign countries, locals can use the universal language to introduce them to tourist attractions, enhancing their experience and fostering cultural understanding.However, it is also important to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of promoting a universal language. One notable concern is that it may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. As people are exposed to the cultural values embedded in the universal language, they may begin to identify with these values, potentially diminishing their sense of national belonging. For example, some Asians have started to embrace individualism, a concept previously foreign to many Asian cultures, due to their exposure to American movies and values, which have been introduced through the proliferation of English.In conclusion, while a single international language contributes significantly to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication, it is equally important for countries to preserve their unique cultural heritage. Ultimately, striking a balance between the promotion of a universal language and the preservation of national cultural identities is crucial for fostering a harmonious and diverse global community.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;As the internet becomes increasingly accessible, people can now gather a vast amount of information on the latest global fashion trends, such as the most popular shoe styles of the season or the most coveted clothing colors of the year. However, some argue that embracing a personal style is more important than following the latest fashion trends. From my perspective, I believe that fashion trends play a more vital role in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because staying on top of fashion trends allows individuals to stay connected to the world's latest developments, which is crucial in today's globalized society. By consistently seeking out the latest fashion information, people gradually broaden their perspectives, becoming more receptive to diverse viewpoints from around the world. In contrast, those who cling to their own personal styles, disregarding the accomplishments of top fashion designers, risk becoming isolated in their own limited worlds and falling behind.Moreover, individuals with limited aesthetic knowledge or originality can develop their own sense of style by staying informed about the latest fashion trends. Without this guidance, they would struggle to choose and match clothes, let alone create their own unique dressing styles.However, it is also true that constantly following fashion trends can lead to a loss of individuality, as people may end up wearing the same styles, resulting in a monotonous world.Considering these points, I conclude that people, especially those lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, should prioritize staying informed about fashion trends to stay in sync with the world's rapid changes. On the other hand, individuals with creative talents can focus on developing their own unique dressing styles, valuing their personal expression and flair.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate over whether wealthy nations have a responsibility to assist poorer ones by providing infrastructure, or to remain detached from global poverty, is a contentious issue. In my opinion, as members of the privileged minority, wealthy nations have a compelling reason to share their wealth with those in need.From an ethical standpoint, it is inhumane to stand by and watch others struggle with famine and poverty without taking action, especially when it requires minimal effort. Compassion, a virtue emphasized in nearly all religions, including Buddhism and Islam, is a fundamental aspect of humanity that distinguishes us from animals.From an economic perspective, providing aid can create a mutually beneficial situation. Underdeveloped nations undoubtedly receive direct benefits from such assistance. For developed nations, working in underdeveloped countries can lead to new medical discoveries and research, driving innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, the vast potential market in these poor countries, many of which have large populations, is a significant opportunity. By fostering good relationships with these nations, wealthy countries can expand their global market and facilitate future international trade. In return, underdeveloped nations can export local products, such as agricultural and mineral goods, at discounted rates, thereby boosting each other's economy.In conclusion, the assistance provided by wealthy nations is not only a moral obligation but also a worthwhile investment that will yield returns in the long run. Ultimately, only those who empathize with their fellow humans can truly prosper.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;It is entirely justified and prudent to prioritize health education and preventative measures over treatment. This approach will yield numerous benefits for both citizens and governments once implemented. Health education has a lasting, positive impact on future generations. By receiving comprehensive health education from a young age, children develop good health habits that they maintain into adolescence. For instance, a child taught to lead a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age is likely to continue this practice as they grow older. Moreover, health education equips people, especially children, with the necessary knowledge to protect themselves from disease risks. Instead of feeling afraid or panicked, they can remain calm when faced with common illnesses such as allergies or seasonal diseases. Many diseases that could be easily cured can become serious if not treated properly. Health education enables people to make informed treatment choices, facilitating quicker recovery.Preventative measures play a crucial role in enhancing the overall health of citizens. Vaccination campaigns, for example, safeguard pregnant women and their babies against severe infectious diseases like flu, smallpox, and rubella. Large-scale vaccination efforts across the country can significantly improve community health. Given the vital role human resources play in a country's development, investing in enhanced public health is a wise decision. Furthermore, since the cost of prevention is often significantly lower than that of treatment, the government can make substantial savings on the national health budget.In conclusion, I firmly believe that prioritizing health education and preventative measures over treatment is the right approach. Nevertheless, it is essential to allocate reasonable attention to treatment to ensure citizens receive the best possible care. By striking this balance, we can foster a healthier, more resilient community and a more sustainable healthcare system.

95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;It is a widely acknowledged fact that, under British and Australian law, juries in a case are not informed about a defendant's past criminal activities. However, some argue that this practice should be reformed to allow juries to have some knowledge of the defendant's background before reaching a verdict. I wholeheartedly support this proposal, as I believe it offers numerous advantages to various parties, which I will discuss below.Primarily, I think that having access to a defendant's past information would facilitate the jury's decision-making process. By being familiar with the defendant's background, the jury can better analyze the crime and make a more informed judgment. For example, if an individual with no prior history of violent crime is suddenly found guilty of murder, the jury can assess whether the act was intentional or a result of circumstances. This, in turn, enables the jury to determine an appropriate punishment.Furthermore, knowing a defendant's past records can lead to a fairer trial. As juries are composed of individuals with limited legal knowledge, providing them with access to a defendant's past records can enable them to think more critically and make a more informed decision. This, in turn, allows the jury to feel more confident in their verdict, knowing that it is based on a thorough consideration of the evidence. Additionally, the defendant is more likely to receive a fair outcome.A potential drawback of this approach is that it may compromise the defendant's right to privacy. If a defendant's background is thoroughly investigated and revealed to the public, and they are ultimately found not guilty, they may feel embarrassed and stigmatized. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that the crimes committed by individuals should be exposed to the public, so that others can be aware of potential dangers and take necessary precautions.In conclusion, I strongly believe that the current practice of jury decision-making should be reformed to allow juries to have access to information about the defendants they are trying. This is crucial for ensuring that juries can deliver a more reliable, fair, and informed verdict. By implementing this change, beneficial reforms can be achieved, as change is often a necessary precursor to progress.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;Whenever an international sporting event like the football World Cup takes place, it draws millions of people from around the globe. As sports have become a universal passion that transcends national borders, popular sporting events can remarkably reduce international tensions and promote national pride in a safe and healthy manner.Firstly, sports events provide excellent athletes with valuable opportunities to meet, learn from each other, and gain experience, enabling them to improve their performance, break records, and bring victories to their respective countries. The large gatherings of people in the host city for sports events also offer a unique chance to discover diverse cultures. Consequently, sports events that embody the spirit of health, honesty, and fairness can foster greater understanding, friendship, and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive yet exciting moments, competitors often exchange warm greetings and congratulations, leading to improved relationships between nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play a vital role in evoking patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. The sight of national flags being honored is often the most emotional moment for each athlete, filling them with a sense of responsibility and a desire to contribute to their beloved country. Witnessing national flags flying proudly alongside others can also unleash pride and happiness in spectators. For instance, when Vietnam won the SEAGAMES championship for the first time in 2008, the streets erupted in a festive atmosphere, with people of all ages waving flags, banners, and singing songs. The excitement persisted for several days, although a minority of individuals got carried away, engaging in reckless behavior such as motor racing or illegal fireworks. Nonetheless, it can be said that sports events have the power to awaken strong feelings of love and responsibility in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only an effective solution to tensions between nations but also a catalyst for safely releasing patriotic emotions. Therefore, I recommend that large-scale sports events be held more frequently in the future to promote global unity and understanding.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;In numerous countries, children are taught from a young age to be self-sufficient and accountable for their actions. As a result, parents often encourage them to take on part-time jobs, as these can provide valuable learning experiences and help them develop a sense of responsibility. However, there are those who believe that this approach is not an effective educational strategy. In my opinion, the advantages of children's participation in paid work far outweigh the disadvantages.Firstly, engaging in paid work allows children to understand the value of earning money. By taking on jobs such as babysitting, doing household chores, or working in shops, they gain essential life skills and experiences that foster maturity and enable them to navigate various real-life situations. Consequently, they are more likely to appreciate the efforts their parents make, respect the value of money, and develop a prudent habit of saving.Secondly, when children are employed, they tend to become more responsible, as their earnings are directly tied to their work ethic and performance. To maintain their jobs, children must strive to complete their tasks diligently. For instance, a child working as a shop assistant must remain vigilant, accurately calculate prices, and take responsibility for any losses.Some argue that paid work may lead children to become overly materialistic, neglect their studies, or fall prey to exploitative employers. Nevertheless, with proper guidance and supervision from parents, children can leverage their work experiences to acquire valuable skills and avoid negative influences.In conclusion, when children participate in paid work with their parents' consent, they can acquire invaluable lessons and develop into mature, responsible individuals. I suggest that parents assist their children in selecting suitable jobs that do not interfere with their academic pursuits, and that the government implement policies to prevent the exploitation of child labor.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, it has become increasingly popular for students to take a break before pursuing university studies. This trend is no longer exclusive to affluent students, as individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds are now embracing the idea of taking a gap year or two. During this time, some students travel extensively, while others opt to gain work experience.The experiences gained through traveling, meeting new people, and working can be highly beneficial. Not only do these experiences boost a student's confidence and independence, but they also provide valuable insight into their future aspirations. Students who work during their break tend to accumulate financial resources, which can be relied upon during their university studies. Moreover, these experiences broaden their perspective, enabling them to make more informed decisions about their academic and career paths.However, taking a break is not without its drawbacks. Once students begin earning a steady income, they may be reluctant to return to their studies, as this would mean sacrificing their financial independence. Additionally, they may struggle to readapt to the academic environment. There is also a risk that some students may never resume their university education, instead opting for short-term courses that can lead to better job prospects and salaries in the short term. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that a complete and proper university education is essential for achieving long-term career success.In my opinion, I support the idea of taking a break before commencing higher education. Students who take a break tend to gain numerous benefits from traveling or working, which enriches their academic experience with real-world insights, making them more mature and contributing members of their academic community.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's fast-paced and competitive world, acquiring extensive knowledge and skills is crucial for achieving success. While many believe that academic institutions are the primary source of these essential tools, I partially agree. However, I also think that it's possible to excel without attending university.For certain professions, such as medicine, engineering, and law, a university education is indispensable. These careers require specialized training and knowledge, which can only be obtained through formal education. Moreover, universities provide opportunities for networking and sharing knowledge, which can be beneficial for future business ventures or entrepreneurial pursuits.On the other hand, there are numerous examples of successful individuals who have achieved greatness without attending university. Entrepreneurs, for instance, often rely on hard work and luck to build their businesses. A notable example is Michael Dell, who dropped out of college at 19 and went on to found Dell Computers. Using his earnings and a loan from his family, he was able to grow his company into the successful brand it is today.Additionally, people born with natural talents can also thrive in their respective fields. The entertainment and sports industries, in particular, have seen a surge in success stories thanks to reality TV shows. David Archuleta, for example, was a relatively unknown individual who rose to fame after appearing on a reality show and now enjoys a large following. This highlights the fact that innate talent can also be a key factor in achieving success.In conclusion, while university education is undoubtedly important for personal growth and success, it's incorrect to assume that it's the sole determining factor. Hard work, natural talent, and dedication also play significant roles in an individual's progress. Ultimately, success is not solely dependent on the education one receives, but rather a combination of these factors.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;The question of when a person should stop working has become a highly debated topic in society. While some people believe that individuals should have the freedom to choose when to retire, others argue against this idea. In my opinion, 60 years old is the appropriate age for retirement. I strongly support setting an age criterion for retirement, and I will outline the reasons for this stance below.Firstly, if older workers dominate the job market, it will lead to fewer job opportunities for recent graduates. As a result, many will be forced to pursue careers unrelated to their field of study. For instance, a medical graduate may feel disheartened after spending five years studying medicine, only to find themselves working in a different profession due to limited job opportunities. Moreover, the lack of genuine passion for a job that wasn't their first choice can lead to a decline in their performance standards at work.Furthermore, not all elderly workers are physically fit. Beyond a certain age, many are more likely to develop health issues such as stress-related diseases and cardiovascular problems. For example, the stressful life of an older teacher can take a toll on their health, making it difficult for them to perform at their best. Additionally, the institution may have to bear the costs of their medical bills, resulting in further losses. Therefore, it would be beneficial to give opportunities to younger individuals at an older age.However, it's essential to acknowledge the valuable expertise of senior workers who have retired. Their experiences and knowledge in fields like engineering, medicine, and law can be highly beneficial to the younger generation. Therefore, it's recommended that retirees visit companies or hospitals to share their knowledge with current staff, bridging the gap between them and passing on their expertise.In conclusion, it's clear that an age limit should be set for retirement. There comes a time when the older generation should pass on the responsibility to the new entrants who are eager to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of a person's working life but also gives them a chance to make up for lost time and pursue other interests.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";While it's true that the internet has made it possible to view artworks and historical objects from around the world from the comfort of our own homes, I firmly believe that public museums and art galleries will remain essential. The convenience of online browsing has led many people to prefer searching for art online, but this experience is limited. Online images are confined to a screen size, which can't replicate the immersive experience of viewing life-sized exhibits in person. For instance, seeing a real mummy in a museum can evoke a sense of mystique that is lost when viewing a digital image.Museums and galleries offer a range of interactive activities that allow visitors to engage directly with the exhibits, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation. For example, the American Museum of Natural History offers a hands-on experience where visitors can recreate a stegosaurus bone by bone, while the Museum of Art in New York allows visitors to examine 17th-century instruments while listening to their music. These experiences are impossible to replicate online.Moreover, viewing an artwork on a computer screen is a vastly different experience from seeing it in person. The texture and details of an artwork, which are crucial to understanding the artist's techniques, can't be fully appreciated on a screen. Additionally, the resolution of a computer screen may not be sufficient to display all the nuances of an artwork, which can lead to a lack of comprehension. In conclusion, while technology has its benefits, I believe that museums and art galleries will continue to play a vital role in our cultural landscape. However, I also think that incorporating computers and digital technology into museums and galleries can enhance the visitor experience, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the artworks and historical objects on display.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;In many countries, courts provide jurors with a defendant's history, but this practice is not followed in the UK and Australia. The notion that a jury should have access to all information about a suspect has led some lawyers to criticize the current rules in these two nations. The prevailing view is that a person's past behavior is indicative of their future actions, which is a key argument in favor of disclosing a defendant's record to the jury. It is acknowledged that having a complete picture of a defendant's history enables jury members to form a more comprehensive understanding of their personality. Additionally, in cases involving serious crimes like kidnapping or murder, a defendant's past record may be relevant in determining their capability to commit such offenses.However, to ensure the jury reaches an objective decision uninfluenced by a defendant's past, the court should only provide details directly relevant to the case at hand. For instance, a defendant with a history of crimes may be more likely to be found guilty compared to someone with a lighter or no criminal record. Conversely, innocent suspects with prior convictions could face unfair judicial outcomes, essentially being penalized twice for past mistakes.In conclusion, I harbor doubts about the merits of disclosing a defendant's history to the jury, due to the potential for subjective and potentially inaccurate verdicts. Therefore, I strongly endorse the existing laws in the UK and Australia, which keep the jury unaware of a defendant's past actions, and I would not advocate for changing these regulations.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;Over the past few decades, the world has made significant strides in technological advancements, particularly in the field of education. This has allowed university lecturers to post their lessons online, making it possible for students to access them from anywhere. As a result, face-to-face interactions between teachers and learners have decreased. Nevertheless, the impact of the Internet on education remains a topic of debate among educators. In my opinion, the Internet will revolutionize the way we learn, making education more accessible and convenient.Firstly, the Internet is a vast source of academic information, capable of meeting the needs of university students. With lectures, e-books, and multi-faceted documents available online, the Internet has become the largest virtual library. Furthermore, the Internet has bridged the gap of distance and time, enabling students to save time searching for information online rather than spending hours searching in bookstores or libraries. Additionally, the Internet offers a more effective and practical way of studying, with virtual flowcharts, animations, and online resources like Google and Wikipedia providing detailed answers to queries.In the near future, the Internet will become an essential component of academic training, given its numerous benefits. Imagine being able to attend a lecture by a renowned speaker in Finland from the comfort of your own home - this is now a reality thanks to technological and Internet advancements.Critics may argue that the Internet has several drawbacks that can negatively impact the education system, such as Internet abuse and the dark web. However, it is essential to recognize that these problems are primarily caused by students' misuse of the Internet, rather than the Internet itself. Therefore, what is needed is a change in learners' attitudes towards the Internet, rather than its elimination from academic studies.After considering both perspectives, I reiterate the importance of the Internet in the learning process. It is evident that the benefits of the Internet far outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just a matter of whether the Internet is helpful or harmful, but rather how it is utilized. It is crucial to be wise and conscious in our use of the Internet.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;Currently, many patients in impoverished countries are dying due to a lack of access to medication rather than the diseases themselves. It has been proposed that companies in developed nations should lower the prices of their medicines to prevent such unnecessary deaths. Indeed, the use of effective medicines would save countless lives. The pharmaceutical industry in developing countries lacks the capacity to produce high-quality medications. The developed world, with its advanced technology, has made significant breakthroughs in medicine production, creating drugs that can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries could access these medications, their health outcomes would likely improve. Reducing the cost of medicines would be a humane gesture.However, the current pricing of medicines is, in fact, reasonable and based on their effectiveness. The process of researching, testing, and mass-producing drugs is costly. These products guarantee human health, which justifies their expense. If companies were forced to lower drug prices, they would incur losses due to production costs, potentially leading to financial ruin. Therefore, this measure is not viable in the long term.Fortunately, alternative solutions exist. Governments can incentivize domestic medicine production by providing land for factories and reducing taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can purchase medicines from developed countries and distribute them to underdeveloped regions for free. In conclusion, I disagree with the proposal to reduce medicine prices, as it may compromise their quality. Instead, governments and medical foundations should take responsibility for distributing drugs to underdeveloped countries at reasonable prices, ensuring both accessibility and quality.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The growing awareness of the harmful effects of smoking among the general public has led to increased pressure on governments and private sectors to take action. Consequently, many businesses have banned smoking on their premises, and some governments have restricted smoking in public areas. It is widely acknowledged that this move will have long-term benefits for both public health and the nation's image.Firstly, the dangers of smoking are well-documented and clinically proven. Smoking is extremely hazardous not only to the smoker but also to those exposed to second-hand smoke over time. According to recent statistics released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health, lung-related diseases caused by smoking are the leading cause of death. Furthermore, a significant proportion of these deaths involve second-hand smokers, particularly vulnerable groups such as young children and pregnant women. Implementing a total ban on public smoking could significantly reduce the number of fatalities.Secondly, restricting public smoking can promote a nation's image as a healthy one, especially when governments impose strict penalties on offenders. For example, Brunei's recent enforcement of a law against smoking in public areas, such as cafes, hospitals, and shopping streets, has led to a decrease in the number of smokers in the country. As a result, Brunei is renowned for its tranquility and cleanliness, demonstrating the benefits of restricting public smoking for the country as a whole.In conclusion, prohibiting smoking in public areas is a crucial step in mitigating associated health risks and creating a healthier nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow suit, prioritizing the well-being of their citizens and the country's interests.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The phrase ""Save the planet Earth"" is a ubiquitous message that resonates globally, emphasizing the need for collective action to preserve our planet. Despite the comforts afforded by human development, numerous initiatives have been launched to mitigate the detrimental effects of unchecked growth. While some argue that these developments enhance our quality of life, the importance of saving Earth cannot be overstated, due to several compelling reasons.First and foremost, the rapid expansion of infrastructure has led to widespread deforestation, giving rise to ""concrete jungles"" that imperil forests and wildlife. As we are well aware, trees play a vital role in producing life-sustaining oxygen by converting harmful carbon dioxide. Furthermore, wildlife is essential for maintaining ecological balance on our planet.Secondly, the large-scale emissions of carbon monoxide from refrigerants, such as air conditioners, have depleted the ozone layer. The significance of the ozone layer is evident in its role in shielding us from harmful ultraviolet rays. Moreover, the excessive emission of carbon dioxide, primarily from vehicles worldwide, has caused a rise in the average temperature at the North Pole, leading to a gradual melting of glaciers and a subsequent increase in water levels.Lastly, the daily production of industrial and domestic waste is severely polluting our planet. For instance, the unrestrained release of industrial waste into oceans has a profound impact on aquatic life. The harmful chemicals present in this waste are responsible for the demise of numerous sea creatures in oceans and rivers.In conclusion, Earth is our home, and it is our responsibility to protect it. Human activities that harm the planet must be regulated, and alternative methods should be devised to minimize damage. Innovative ideas should be encouraged to reduce our environmental footprint without compromising our quality of life. By adopting a more sustainable approach, we can preserve the beauty and wonder of our planet for future generations."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The debate about whether companies should set a retirement age of 55 to create more job opportunities for the younger generation has sparked controversy. While some argue that this is a good way to support young people, others disagree. On the one hand, encouraging workers to retire at 55 to make way for younger job seekers has its advantages. For instance, recent graduates can bring innovative and practical ideas to an organization, as they have acquired the latest knowledge and skills at university. Moreover, a higher proportion of young adults in the workforce can enhance productivity and efficiency, as they tend to be physically stronger and more energetic, enabling them to handle heavy workloads and meet deadlines.On the other hand, forcing older employees to retire to make way for younger workers has several drawbacks. From a personal perspective, it creates a sense of unfairness between older and younger generations, as every individual has the right to continue working as long as they are capable, regardless of age or physical ability. From a social perspective, mass early retirement would place a significant financial burden on the local government, which would need to provide sufficient pension payments and medical care for retired citizens.In conclusion, although introducing early retirement may have some benefits, it is likely to create discrimination among different age groups and increase financial pressure on the government. Ultimately, the decision to set a retirement age of 55 is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of the potential consequences.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;"The debate surrounding mass media control has become a highly contentious issue in recent times. While some argue that the government should exert less control over the dissemination of media information to the public, I firmly believe that increased regulation is necessary to safeguard the public from exposure to inappropriate content and unwanted foreign cultural influences.One of the primary arguments in favor of stricter media control is the need to limit the spread of violent and sexual content, which can have a profound impact on young people, particularly during their formative years. For instance, the internet cartoon series ""Happy Tree Friends"" is notorious for its graphic violence, featuring characters who often lose limbs or have their heads torn off. Another reason to support media control is the importation of foreign programs by television companies, which can introduce ideas that may not be aligned with local cultural values. A few years ago, a Japanese game show that involved throwing cream cakes at the loser was widely criticized for its environmental unfriendliness.On the other hand, the main counterargument is that the government should prioritize citizen safety by providing timely access to information, especially during disasters and disease outbreaks. The SARS outbreak in 2003 is a case in point, where the Chinese government's decision to limit information access led to a significant number of deaths. However, it can also be argued that restricting information can help prevent unnecessary fear and unrest among citizens.Both sides of the debate have valid points. In my opinion, while citizen safety is crucial, the government should still regulate the amount of violent and sexual content and censor culturally unsuitable information. Establishing a council to monitor media information and ensure it is suitable for public consumption could be a practical solution. By striking a balance between these competing interests, the government can create a safer and more informed media environment for its citizens."
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;A global debate surrounds the responsibilities of citizens, with some individuals believing that paying taxes is their sole obligation, while others argue that being a member of society entails a broader range of duties.Taxes are a crucial source of income for every country, particularly for developing nations. By paying taxes, citizens are contributing to their country's development and economy, thereby fulfilling a fundamental aspect of their civic duty. However, some argue that the responsibilities of citizens extend far beyond taxation. For instance, adhering to laws imposed by the government is essential for maintaining social order and reducing crime rates, which in turn, fosters a peaceful environment conducive to rapid national development.Moreover, citizens have a duty to preserve and promote their country's cultural heritage and history. This can be achieved through active engagement with educational materials, such as studying in school or reading relevant literature. Additionally, fostering a sense of community and unity among citizens is vital for national development. When individuals within a society are strongly bonded, they create a harmonious and supportive environment where mutual aid and cooperation thrive.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the duties of a citizen encompass a wide range of responsibilities that go beyond the payment of taxes. To make a meaningful contribution to society, individuals must engage in a variety of activities and commitments that promote social cohesion, cultural preservation, and economic development.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;One of the most pressing issues in the realm of animal rights today is the practice of animal experimentation. While numerous medical breakthroughs, including the development of cancer and HIV treatments, have been achieved through animal testing, and many scientists argue that this practice is essential for advancing human health, I firmly believe that primates, and by extension other animals, should be afforded the same rights as humans.There are compelling arguments against the continuation of animal testing. Firstly, the costs associated with this practice far outweigh any potential benefits. Each year, millions of animals are killed by cosmetic companies, farms, and medical schools for the purpose of testing products, often without yielding any substantial or beneficial outcomes. The financial burden of animal testing is significant, given the necessity to feed, care for, and administer drugs or experimental substances to the animals.Secondly, animals are subjected to unnatural living conditions, which can significantly impact the reliability of test results. Recent studies have highlighted instances of neglect and poor treatment, which understandably affect the animals' reactions to drugs. A disturbing example of this mistreatment was captured in a 2003 video by a lab technician, showing primates confined to cages without access to pain medication, including a baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. This egregious mistreatment reinforces my conviction that animal testing is both an expensive and inhumane practice.Furthermore, the argument can be made that animal testing violates fundamental ethical and genetic principles. Many individuals concur that causing pain to animals is not only inhumane and cruel but also potentially misleading, given the differences in how animals and humans respond to drugs. Personally, I believe that humans have no moral justification to utilize animals in ways that do not directly benefit the animals themselves.Considering the aforementioned points, it appears to me that animal testing lacks clear, definitive results and, consequently, should be outlawed. The inherent cruelty, potential for misleading data, and significant financial costs all contribute to a compelling case against the practice. It is our moral obligation to reconsider the role of animal testing in scientific research and to seek out alternative, humane methods that do not involve the exploitation and suffering of animals.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";Examinations are a ubiquitous assessment tool used globally in education systems to measure learning outcomes at every stage of the educational process. They serve as a checkpoint to confirm a learner's readiness to progress to the next level. Nevertheless, there is a growing sentiment that the utility of examinations warrants reevaluation.On the one hand, examinations offer several benefits. They promote fairness by applying uniform conditions to all test-takers, and their versatility allows them to assess various aspects of reasoning and knowledge through different question types, such as multiple-choice questions and essays. However, examinations also have their drawbacks. Some individuals may perform well on exams due to their test-taking strategies rather than genuine understanding or skills. Conversely, others may underperform due to exam anxiety. This often leads to a narrowed focus on the curriculum, where both educators and learners concentrate solely on the material likely to be tested, thereby limiting the breadth of the educational experience.To mitigate these concerns, several adjustments should be made. Exams should, whenever feasible, align closely with the learning environment's content and activities. Additionally, incorporating a variety of exam tasks can provide a fairer assessment for individuals with diverse skill sets. It's also crucial to consider alternative assessment methods, such as written assignments to evaluate independent research skills, or group projects to assess teamwork and collaboration abilities.In conclusion, while exams undoubtedly play a significant role in objective achievement assessment, it's imperative that they are meticulously designed and complemented with other evaluation methods to truly enhance the education system. By doing so, exams can serve as a valuable tool for assessing learning outcomes, rather than a limitation to the educational process.
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of impoverished nations is heavily reliant on advancements in healthcare, education, and trade. In order to bridge the gap, these countries require assistance from their more affluent counterparts in these critical areas.First and foremost, the healthcare sector in poorer nations is often plagued by a scarcity of medical professionals, including doctors and nurses, compared to richer nations. The large population in these countries, exacerbated by a lack of family planning, has resulted in an imbalance between the number of medical practitioners and the population size. Furthermore, the dearth of hospitals in these nations is insufficient to meet the demands of patients. To address these concerns, richer nations can provide significant contributions by sending medical professionals to these countries and donating funds for the construction of hospitals.Secondly, in the realm of education, it is widely acknowledged that poorer countries face a shortage of teachers in schools and lecturers in higher education institutions. Additionally, education in these countries is often not subsidized, making it inaccessible to all but a select group of students who can afford it. To resolve the issue of manpower in education, richer countries can assign experienced educators to train additional teachers and lecturers in poorer nations. Simultaneously, to tackle the problem of education costs, richer countries should offer scholarships and loans to deserving students.Lastly, in the domain of trade, the disparity between richer and poorer countries is stark, with the latter lagging behind due to financial constraints. The limited trading activity in poorer countries can also be attributed to inadequate transportation infrastructure. For instance, residents in rural areas still rely on subsistence farming for food production. As a gesture of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial assistance to poorer countries to stimulate trading activities. They can also offer consultations on establishing a comprehensive and efficient transportation network to support trade.In conclusion, richer nations have a heightened responsibility to assist poorer nations in the areas of healthcare, education, and trade. Enhancements in these sectors will lead to an improved quality of life for residents in poorer nations, enabling them to contribute to the growth and development of their homelands.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"In recent years, the integration of technological tools into the learning process has become increasingly prevalent. Nevertheless, I disagree with the notion that the surge in technology will revolutionize the education system by substituting teachers with computers.There are several compelling reasons why teachers cannot be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers are inherently dependent on human operation. While it is undeniable that technological tools have become essential in modern classrooms, with tools like PowerPoint presentations and LCD projectors making lessons more engaging and accessible, it is crucial to acknowledge that these technologies require trained staff to utilize them effectively. According to scientific findings, every classroom necessitates the presence of skilled teachers to harness the full potential of these innovative teaching methods. I concur that computers have significantly enhanced the learning process, but they are merely tools that require human oversight to function optimally.Secondly, the necessity of human interaction in the educational process cannot be overstated. Regardless of technological advancements, computers will never be capable of replicating the complex dynamics of human communication. An interview with Josh Trumm, founder of the Teachers Global Group, underscores the importance of human interaction: ""The verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and students is the foundational step towards a meaningful education. Without a person to explain and empathize with their problems, students cannot truly learn."" I am inclined to agree with this perspective, as teachers possess the unique ability to form emotional connections with their students, serving not only as educators but also as mentors and role models.In conclusion, the notion of a school without teachers is untenable. I firmly believe that computers will continue to be employed as supplementary tools in the learning process, but they will never supplant the role of teachers. Teachers embody a multifaceted role that encompasses not only instruction but also guidance and mentorship, rendering them indispensable in the educational process."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;In recent years, the debate over agricultural development has become increasingly contentious. On one hand, some people believe that the integration of advanced plant foods and cutting-edge technology can substantially reduce the cost of producing farm products. On the other hand, others argue that this collaboration has a series of detrimental effects on both human health and society as a whole.It is undeniable that the use of advanced fertilizers and automated harvesting equipment can increase farmers' economic profits. The application of artificial fertilizers enhances the productivity of farmland, allowing for higher crop yields, while automated machinery improves work efficiency during harvests. As a result, the production and labor costs of agricultural products have decreased significantly.However, the use of high-tech fertilizers poses a potential threat to human health. Unlike organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers contain unusual chemicals that not only alter the genetic makeup of crops but also remain present in the plants permanently. Consequently, consumers who regularly consume these fertilized products are more likely to suffer from various diseases in the future.Furthermore, an over-reliance on electronic equipment for harvesting has several negative impacts on society. For instance, it exacerbates air pollution by releasing excessive exhaust emissions, whereas manual harvesting methods prevent severe environmental damage. Additionally, the use of mechanical reapers contributes to the rise of unemployment rates in the farming industry, as high-tech harvesting equipment replaces a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, although the adoption of advanced plant foods and machinery can lead to significant financial gains for farmers, it is clear that the drawbacks of applying these new developments in the agricultural industry cannot be ignored. The potential risks to human health and the negative impacts on society must be carefully considered in the pursuit of economic success.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;In today's economic climate, governments worldwide are seeking ways to allocate their budgets efficiently and boost their economies. One proposed solution is to divert funds away from artists and toward more pressing areas like medical research and space exploration. However, I strongly disagree with this suggestion for several compelling reasons.Firstly, art plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of life and attracting tourism. Iconic monuments, for instance, not only showcase a city's history and culture but also make it a more beautiful and appealing destination for tourists. Since tourism is a primary revenue source for many countries, governments should support the arts, as they are essential for boosting the tourism industry.Furthermore, art is a significant medium for preserving a nation's culture and history. The sculptures and paintings exhibited in museums and galleries reflect the civilization and culture of each generation, allowing young people to gain insight into their country's heritage by observing these artworks. This preservation of cultural history is invaluable and underscores the importance of governmental support for artists.Additionally, artistic talent is exceedingly rare and precious, and it would be a waste to let it go unappreciated. Just as talents in science, literature, and other fields are valued and nurtured, so too should artistic abilities. Not everyone possesses the gift of creating meaningful and impactful art, making it a talent that deserves recognition and support.In conclusion, art is an invaluable asset to every country, and the unique talent required to create it is not universally available. Therefore, I firmly believe that governments should provide assistance and encouragement to artists, enabling them to continue their work. This support is not only a cultural investment but also a strategic one, contributing to the enrichment of society and the economy through tourism and cultural preservation.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The correlation between technological advancements and environmental issues is undeniable. There are two prevailing perspectives on how to address these problems. On one hand, some individuals believe that adopting a simpler way of life, devoid of the luxuries brought about by technology, can mitigate environmental problems. On the other hand, others argue that technology itself holds the key to resolving these issues. This discussion will delve into both viewpoints.Proponents of a simpler lifestyle argue that the excessive use of technological conveniences, such as air conditioners and automobiles, contributes significantly to environmental degradation. They posit that by abstaining from these luxuries, pollution would decrease, and the depletion of natural resources like fossil fuels would slow, ultimately leading to environmental conservation.In contrast, advocates for technology argue that it is impractical to expect people to revert to primitive ways of living, especially considering the significant strides humanity has made in technological advancements. They point to numerous innovations that are actively combating environmental challenges. For instance, technological solutions are being developed to address water scarcity in developing nations, such as Africa. One such innovation involves converting seawater into clean drinking water through pressurization and filtration using carbon nanotubes, effectively tapping into an almost limitless resource.Moreover, ambitious projects like Japan's space solar power system, slated for completion by 2030, aim to harness solar energy to meet global electricity demands without generating nuclear or greenhouse gas emissions. The potential impact of such a system is monumental, promising to provide energy for essential services and institutions worldwide, potentially ushering in a new industrial revolution.In conclusion, it is evident that technology alone has the potential to solve the world's environmental problems. As we enter an era where engineering and technology are making significant positive impacts on the planet, it becomes clear that reverting to simpler, less technologically advanced ways of living is not a practical or viable solution. Instead, embracing and further developing technological innovations offers the most promising path forward in addressing and resolving environmental challenges.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The notion that professional athletes and entertainers are fairly compensated with salaries ranging into the millions each year is a common one. However, I argue that their actual value to society does not justify such high pay. Instead, I believe that a more modest salary would be more appropriate, especially when compared to individuals in scientific, social, and economic fields who make significant contributions to society.Proponents of high salaries for athletes and entertainers argue that these individuals possess exceptional talents that set them apart from others. For instance, few people can match the basketball prowess of legendary player Michael Jordan, who won numerous NBA championships. They also emphasize the rigorous training and countless competitions these individuals must endure to reach the pinnacle of their careers. With only a select few achieving fame and success, it is reasoned that their hard work and dedication warrant substantial financial rewards.However, I believe that the value of their talents should not be overstated. Critics argue that the contributions of athletes and entertainers to society are relatively insignificant. While their performances may bring aesthetic and entertainment value to audiences, they do not contribute to the advancement of society in meaningful ways. In contrast, scientists develop innovative technologies that improve daily life, doctors care for and cure patients, and law enforcement officers maintain national safety and stability. Athletes and entertainers, on the other hand, primarily provide relaxation and enjoyment for their audiences. Although their role is necessary, it is less crucial than that of doctors, scientists, or other essential professions. As a result, their high salaries seem unwarranted, especially when compared to the modest pay of essential workers who can barely afford basic necessities.In conclusion, based on the analysis presented, professional athletes and entertainers are overcompensated relative to their contributions to society. I firmly believe that there should be a salary adjustment for these individuals to bring their pay more in line with that of people in other fields, such as science and social work, who are the true drivers of national prosperity.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;As technological advancements continue to accelerate, there is a widespread notion that the internet and computers will eventually replace the traditional role of teachers in the near future. This concept can be argued from two distinct perspectives, each presenting unique viewpoints.Proponents of this idea argue that the internet is an unparalleled source of information, surpassing the knowledge that even the most experienced teachers can accumulate. The internet and computers offer a more comprehensive and engaging learning experience, incorporating visual and auditory stimuli that make learning enjoyable, particularly for children.On the other hand, critics argue that despite the undeniable educational benefits of the internet, there are significant limitations. While the internet provides a vast amount of information, much of it is unverified by experts, rendering it questionable. Although computers can indicate whether an answer is correct or incorrect, they cannot provide the in-depth explanations that a human teacher can offer. Face-to-face communication enables teachers to identify individual students' weaknesses and tailor their teaching methods to meet the needs of their students, a capability that computers lack.In conclusion, while both perspectives present valid arguments, I tend to believe that although the internet can be a valuable educational tool, it will never fully replace the unique role of human teachers.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"The debate over capital punishment remains a contentious issue in many countries. While some argue that it serves as a necessary deterrent to violent crimes, others contend that it is an immoral practice that violates human rights. As societies evolve and human rights gain greater recognition, the notion of ""murdering"" criminals becomes increasingly unacceptable.First and foremost, it is essential to acknowledge that every individual has an inherent right to life, and no authority should be empowered to take that away. Although the harm caused by criminals to society and their victims is undoubtedly significant, it is crucial to remember that they are human beings whose lives have value. Furthermore, capital punishment fails to address the underlying consequences of crime, and it can also inflict hardship on the criminal's family, while the pain of the victim's loved ones can never be fully consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is not the only means of controlling crime rates. Life imprisonment can be just as effective, as it involves detaining individuals in prison for the remainder of their lives. In terms of punishment, being confined to a miserable existence, restricted from the outside world, and burdened by guilt every day in a confined space can be a more severe and haunting penalty than immediate execution.The third argument against capital punishment is the risk of wrongful convictions. Juries, being human, can lack discretion and make mistakes, leading to the execution of innocent people who did not commit the crime. This raises questions about the fairness and reliability of the judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment may serve as a stark warning to society, I strongly oppose it due to its absurdity and inhumanity. Moreover, it can be replaced with a life sentence, which can provide a more humane and effective alternative. Ultimately, it is essential to prioritize human rights and dignity, even in the face of heinous crimes, and to seek more compassionate and just solutions to address the complexities of crime and punishment."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;It is undeniable that companies, factories, and businesses are established to provide essential products and generate profits for their owners. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that businesses should be given free rein to pursue profit without any restrictions. Unfettered permission to prioritize profits above all else can have devastating consequences.Firstly, if businesses are allowed to operate without any oversight or control, they pose a significant threat to the well-being of humans, animals, and the environment. The daily reports of environmental degradation caused by toxic substances emitted by factories are a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked industrial activity. The lack of regulation can have catastrophic consequences, including harm to human health, destruction of ecosystems, and loss of biodiversity.Furthermore, if companies are permitted to prioritize profits over all else, they may compromise on product quality and safety, putting consumers' lives at risk. A disturbing example of this is the recent incident where a company sold substandard baby milk, resulting in the tragic loss of several infant lives. Such incidents highlight the importance of stringent quality control measures and the need for businesses to be held accountable for their actions.In conclusion, it is imperative that governments and regulatory bodies closely monitor companies, factories, and businesses to prevent them from prioritizing profits over environmental and human well-being. Unchecked corporate activity can have far-reaching and devastating consequences, and it is the responsibility of regulatory authorities to ensure that businesses operate in a responsible and sustainable manner.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;Although some of my neighbors may disagree, I personally support the idea of building a new high school in our community. The current high school in our district is outdated and lacks essential facilities, hindering students' ability to receive a quality education. I firmly believe that the new high school will be a valuable addition to our community's educational system.Firstly, I think the new high school will provide numerous opportunities for students interested in education. The old high school is in dire need of modern educational materials, repairs to its sports facilities, and updated laboratory equipment for subjects like physics and chemistry. In the new school, students will be able to study with renewed enthusiasm and energy. The improved facilities will undoubtedly enhance their learning experience.Secondly, the new high school will serve as a hub for students from different communities and districts to connect and interact. After classes, students will gather in the school building to participate in various competitions, such as football matches, which will bring together students from different high schools. These events will foster social connections among students, allowing them to build relationships that extend beyond their own school. While it is true that these competitions may generate some noise, potentially disturbing nearby residents, I do not consider this a significant enough reason to cancel these events.In conclusion, the new high school offers numerous benefits, including the opportunity for students from different backgrounds to connect, and the provision of modern educational equipment that will increase students' enthusiasm for learning. The only drawback is the potential noise from competitions, but I believe this is a minor issue. Overall, I am convinced that the new high school will be a great asset to our community.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;It may seem that teenagers, particularly those between the ages of 15 and 18, are fully grown and capable of making important decisions on their own. However, in my opinion, teenagers require more attention and guidance compared to older individuals. I will discuss my perspective in two main areas.Firstly, it is undeniable that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced and knowledgeable, making them the best advisors for their children. Having lived through various experiences, they can offer valuable advice that can help children avoid making costly mistakes and wasting time and money. By listening to their guidance, teenagers can make the most of their lives and enjoy them to the fullest.Furthermore, I firmly believe that parents and adult relatives are the best friends and confidants for teenagers. Unfortunately, there are individuals who take advantage of young people's naivety and cheat them for personal gain. These individuals often target young people because they perceive them as immature and easily manipulated.In conclusion, while people of all ages have the freedom to make their own decisions, it is sometimes beneficial for young individuals to seek advice from parents and adult relatives to prevent potential problems from arising. This guidance can serve as a safeguard, helping teenagers navigate complex decisions and make informed choices that will positively impact their lives.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;It's rare to find someone who says they had an unpleasant childhood. When people reminisce about their memories, they often fondly recall events from their childhood. Even if these events were difficult at the time, they become sweet memories in adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is undoubtedly the happiest time in a person's life, and there are two main reasons for this.Firstly, children have the freedom to do as they please, without restrictions or limitations. As they are in a stage of growth and development, they are encouraged to try new things and explore their surroundings. As a result, they don't have to worry about arguments or punishments. This freedom allows them to discover and learn without fear of reprimand.Additionally, children are not expected to take on responsibilities, such as education or work, which means they have plenty of time to enjoy this stage of their life. I can attest to this from my own experience - during my childhood, I made many friends, traveled to many cities in my county, and became familiar with various animals and plants. This carefree period allowed me to try new things, experience life, and create lasting memories.In conclusion, I firmly believe that childhood is the best phase of a person's life. Children are not only free to do as they please without fear of punishment, but they also have the time and freedom to try new things, experience life, and enjoy themselves. This unique combination makes childhood a truly special and happy time.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;For centuries, universities have played a vital role in shaping individuals' lives. People attend university for diverse reasons, but in my opinion, the top three motivations are to acquire increased knowledge, prepare for a career, and gain new experiences.Firstly, universities are ideal institutions for fostering intellectual growth. The academic environment provides access to a vast array of information and resources, including renowned professors, well-trained teachers, and state-of-the-art facilities like laboratories and libraries. This enables students to expand their knowledge and conduct in-depth research across various academic disciplines. As a result, they gain a deeper understanding of their field of study.Secondly, attending university marks a significant turning point in one's life, offering a plethora of new experiences. The sheer number of students enrolled in universities surpasses that of any other educational institution, providing an unparalleled opportunity to form diverse and extensive relationships with people from all corners of the globe. For instance, my brother is studying at an international university with a multicultural community comprising students from Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, and beyond. He shared his excitement about immersing himself in this novel environment, which was one of his primary motivations for attending university.Lastly, career preparation is a fundamental function of universities. Students engage in a range of activities, including homework, assignments, classes, volunteer work, internships, and part-time jobs. These experiences help them navigate the outside world, discover their passions, and identify their life goals. Ultimately, they gain clarity on where to focus their efforts to achieve their objectives.In summary, individuals may attend university for various reasons, whether to enjoy new experiences, prepare for their future careers, or expand their knowledge. Despite the diversity of purposes, it is essential for university students to remain focused on their objectives and strive to achieve their best.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;"I don't feel the need to stress the benefits of having a large number of casual acquaintances. However, I still believe that having one or two close friends is more valuable than having a large network of acquaintances.It's undeniable that being friends with someone is a unique experience that differs from simply being acquaintances. Forming close friendships is not an easy task, as I believe that friends are individuals who share a strong compatibility with one another. After spending two years in college, I've come to realize that people can be more different than similar, having grown up in different families and been educated in various ways. Sometimes, acquaintances remain just that - acquaintances. We may spend time together, but we may never truly become friends. Therefore, it's often easier to have casual acquaintances than to form close friendships.Close friends, on the other hand, can easily understand each other's feelings due to their similarities. In contrast, acquaintances may not be able to understand you as well as your friends do, and they may not even take the time to consider your emotions. Everyone plays the role of both acquaintance and friend, but being friendly is not enough to qualify as a true friend. When my friend is unwell, I wouldn't just ask if they're okay like an acquaintance would; instead, I'd do my best to help them recover as soon as possible. If my friend is heading in the wrong direction, I'd try to guide them back on track, rather than standing by and doing nothing. I believe my friend would do the same for me.In conclusion, a friend is someone you genuinely care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life, second only to my family. I'm a person who values deep, meaningful relationships, and I'm content with having just one or two close friends. If someone offered to replace my close friends with thousands of acquaintances, I would undoubtedly say no."
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";Life today is vastly different from what it was half a century ago. While technological advancements have helped solve numerous problems, they have also taken away certain aspects of life that we once had. In my opinion, life in the past brought more happiness to people than it does today, and there are several reasons for this.Firstly, life was simpler in the past. Nowadays, everyone is competing with each other, and with the rising global population, competition has become increasingly fierce. If you're not able to handle your job, someone else will replace you immediately. People have to put in much more effort just to maintain their standard of living. Therefore, life in the old days was easier and less stressful than it is today.Secondly, the environment today is severely damaged. When I look out the window, I don't see blue skies, trees, or mountains, but instead, I see cold, towering buildings. Every day, I walk on hard roads, breathe in polluted air, and live in a limited space. To make matters worse, it has been proven that living in such conditions can lead to mental health issues. Thus, the environment our grandparents lived in was more comfortable and healthier than the one we live in today.Thirdly, the pace of life has become overwhelming. While we can now access news from around the world, chat with people online, and travel globally by plane, it also means that any event happening anywhere in the world can instantly impact our lives. If we can't react quickly and properly, we become vulnerable. We have no choice but to live at a fast pace, which can be exhausting and stressful.In conclusion, while some people may be living in relatively good conditions, they are in the minority. Society has become too focused on accumulating wealth and advancing technology, and in the process, we have lost things that can never be regained. Behind the glamorous facade of modern life, we have lost aspects of life that truly mattered, and this loss is irreparable.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High school is a critical period when students decide on their future careers and the fields they wish to specialize in. In my opinion, high schools should allow students to choose their courses for several compelling reasons: it promotes freedom of choice, fosters progress in academic grades and knowledge, and enables students to discover their aptitudes.Firstly, students should have the autonomy to select the subjects they want to study. Denying them this freedom is a violation of their rights. As citizens of an independent nation, it is essential that we are aware of our rights and opportunities, which are crucial in achieving our goals and dreams.Secondly, permitting students to choose their classes can lead to improved academic performance and grades. This approach can also help minimize conflicts between students and teachers, creating a more enjoyable and productive learning environment for both parties. For instance, when I took an art class, everyone shared similar interests, making it easier to understand and connect with one another. Allowing students to choose their fields of study based on their interests is undoubtedly beneficial.Lastly, and most importantly, I support this idea because it enables students to explore areas where they have a natural aptitude. When schools provide such opportunities, students are more likely to excel and succeed in their future endeavors, which is one of the primary reasons people pursue education. Moreover, these opportunities can nurture future geniuses and lead to groundbreaking achievements.In conclusion, as a young individual, I hope that my future children will have the opportunity to acquire knowledge in the subjects they are passionate about, leading to distinguished achievements that not only benefit them but also society at large. The three reasons outlined above can help cultivate well-educated students with bright, independent minds, capable of making a positive impact in the world.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The debate over whether people should live at a faster or slower pace is a contentious issue, with multiple perspectives and complexities. While some individuals rush to complete tasks, others prefer a more relaxed approach. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion, and I firmly believe that living at a higher pace is preferable.My primary reason for this stance is the importance of time management. With numerous significant tasks to accomplish, it's essential to prioritize and make the most of our time. A personal experience that illustrates this point is when I missed a university entrance exam due to underestimating the time required for breakfast and transportation. Unfortunately, I got stuck in traffic and missed the first test. This experience taught me the value of being proactive and making the most of my time.Another crucial aspect of living at a higher pace is that it prevents laziness and increases the likelihood of achieving my goals. For instance, I spent extensive time practicing piano, which ultimately led to my victory in a piano competition. This experience demonstrates that maintaining a high pace can be a key factor in achieving success.Some may argue that living at a slower pace allows for greater enjoyment of life, as it eliminates the pressure of time management and the need for achievement. However, I am skeptical about the validity of this claim. In my opinion, those who adopt a slower pace and miss out on opportunities, such as winning a competition, are unlikely to experience true happiness. In contrast, I find immense joy in the thrill of victory and the sense of accomplishment that comes with living at a higher pace.Based on the reasons outlined above, I firmly believe that living at a higher pace is superior, as its advantages far outweigh those of the alternative. While I acknowledge that other perspectives may have some merit, I am convinced that my arguments in favor of a higher pace are more compelling and plausible. Ultimately, I prefer to live life at a faster pace, and I am confident that this approach will serve me well in achieving my goals and finding fulfillment.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry is emerging as a significant driver of economic growth. However, some argue that this perspective overlooks the potential ecological and environmental harm caused by tourist activities, as well as their negative impacts on local communities and ecosystems. In my opinion, with effective management and regulation, a thriving tourism sector can be a substantial source of economic growth and prosperity for both rural and urban areas.One of the most notable advantages of tourism is its potential to greatly enhance economic development in a specific region or state. This occurs not only through direct spending by tourists but also by creating direct and indirect employment opportunities in the community, including in retail, agriculture, and the service industry. A well-regulated tourism program also leads to increased tax revenue and the expansion of local markets for accommodations, luxury goods, and other services. Furthermore, tourism generates a significant number of jobs, both directly and indirectly, in sectors such as retail, hotels, transportation, agriculture, and services. This increase in job opportunities enables more people to contribute to society through the purchase of goods and services with their growing incomes, thereby energizing the economic cycle and leading to local economic prosperity.Some might argue against tourism, citing its environmental and cultural impacts. However, when compared to other industries like resource extraction and manufacturing, tourism is far less destructive. For example, paper mills release hundreds of thousands of tons of pollutants into rivers, causing severe water pollution. In contrast, the vast majority of tourists, especially those who spend considerable time and money visiting rural areas, are educated and likely to behave responsibly when required to do so.After weighing both sides of the argument, it becomes clear that the tourism sector is beneficial due to its significant socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that, under appropriate management, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks, making it a desirable sector for economic growth and development.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The question of whether governments should provide financial support for artistic features in society has ignited a fierce debate. Some argue that allocating funds to the arts is a misallocation of national resources, and that the money would be better spent on essential public services. However, I firmly believe that investing in the arts is in the best interest of society as a whole.First and foremost, it is undeniable that governments have a responsibility to provide their citizens with access to adequate public services and facilities in an efficient manner. It is crucial that individuals have access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, transportation, and communication. Nevertheless, these necessities only cater to people's physical needs, leaving a significant gap in addressing their mental well-being. This is where the arts come into play, as they have the potential to provide mental health benefits, either subtly or overtly, that are essential for a society's overall well-being.Moreover, the arts are instrumental in the comprehensive development of a society. It is rare to find a developed country that does not prioritize music, painting, literature, and other artistic fields as part of its governmental considerations. By enriching people's lives and broadening their perspectives, the arts significantly contribute to the positive evolution of societies in multiple ways.In addition, investments in the arts can generate employment opportunities and potentially yield returns on investment. The value of artworks created as a result of such investments should be considered national assets, as they can appreciate in value over time and be sold to replenish governmental funds. This approach not only validates the financial viability of investing in the arts but also highlights its cultural enrichment benefits.In conclusion, investing in the arts cannot be viewed as a waste of resources in any sense. Instead, it enriches the cultural fabric of a society, providing multiple benefits for both governments and individuals. The arts play a vital role in the holistic development of a nation, impacting its citizens' quality of life and contributing to the country's overall prosperity.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";"Since the onset of industrialization in the late 19th century, having a career has been the cornerstone of living. Traditionally, individuals have pursued a single career as a means of supporting themselves and their families. However, a contemporary trend indicates that newer generations are more inclined to explore multiple professions and acquire several higher education certificates to enhance their earnings and achieve financial stability.In the past, a full-time job with a steady income was sufficient for an individual to support themselves and their loved ones. Nevertheless, the recent recession has led to a significant economic downturn globally, prompting widespread layoffs and workforce reductions. As a consequence, people are now focusing on diversifying their income streams by taking on multiple jobs or pursuing further qualifications to secure their financial well-being.The advent of technology has also played a significant role in exacerbating unemployment, a phenomenon referred to as ""Technological Unemployment."" North American economists, after analyzing the current American economic landscape, have reported that technology is eliminating more jobs than it is creating. For instance, robots, automation, and software are increasingly replacing human workers in professions such as clerical work, interpretation, security services, retail, and particularly in manufacturing. This has put many individuals' jobs at risk. Consequently, the most effective way to ensure a stable income is to have multiple jobs.Lastly, corporate policies aimed at reducing labor costs by paying employees less is another factor driving workers to seek opportunities in diverse sectors. Considering these factors, it is evident that people are becoming more conscious of the need to acquire additional educational qualifications and are more inclined to work in various fields simultaneously to increase their earnings and support themselves."
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The computer is a modern device that has become an essential tool in human life. People utilize computers for various purposes, including work, study, and communication. However, there is a growing debate about whether computers are more of a hindrance than a help in social life. Some argue that computers have become an indispensable part of daily life, making it impossible for people to function without them. In my opinion, computers have a significant influence on society, and people's lives are already heavily reliant on these devices.I would argue that computers can be a major obstacle for some individuals. A study by Mediabank found that the majority of Australian adults are spending less time socializing with family and friends due to their extensive computer use, which averages around nine hours a day. This trend suggests that the idea of computers being beneficial is being overlooked.On the other hand, computers can also make people's work more efficient. For instance, businessmen use computers to create presentations and communicate with colleagues. Features like email and the internet enable busy professionals to maintain relationships and conduct business deals even across different countries. As a result, many workers have become dependent on computers to perform their jobs effectively.In conclusion, in this technological era, computers have become an integral part of human life. People's daily routines now revolve around computer use, and it has become a deeply ingrained habit. Human activities are increasingly influenced by computer usage, and it is clear that people's lives are heavily controlled by these devices.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The increasing educational level of the workforce has led to a growing trend among employers to consider criteria beyond qualifications, such as social skills, when selecting employees. While some employers still prioritize qualifications as the primary consideration, others recognize the value of social skills in the workplace. This essay aims to explore both sides of the argument and present my own perspective.On one hand, some argue that qualifications should be the primary measure of an employee's value. It is essential for workers to be well-educated and trained to perform their job duties effectively. For instance, in professional fields like medicine, a university degree and extensive experience are typically required. In such cases, social skills may seem less crucial, as they may not directly contribute to the success of a surgical procedure.On the other hand, the importance of social skills is being increasingly recognized by employers. With the shift towards team-based work environments, interpersonal skills play a vital role in facilitating collaboration and resolving conflicts among colleagues. Employees with strong social skills can navigate disagreements more harmoniously and maintain positive relationships with their clients, which leads to improved customer satisfaction. Moreover, as organizations become more customer-centric, excellent social skills are essential for building and maintaining strong client relationships.In my opinion, while qualifications remain the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency, the importance of social skills should not be underestimated. Social skills can significantly enhance job performance by facilitating effective interaction and communication with colleagues, clients, and other stakeholders. By striking a balance between qualifications and social skills, employers can ensure they hire well-rounded employees who can excel in their roles and contribute to the organization's success.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;Despite unprecedented global prosperity, a substantial number of people continue to live in poverty, suffer from the aftermath of wars, or face the devastating effects of natural disasters. Charity organizations play a crucial role in providing support to these individuals. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether aid should prioritize those most in need, regardless of their nationality, or focus on the citizens of the country where the charity is based. In my opinion, international aid should take precedence.The rationale behind prioritizing international aid is clear: people in other countries often face far more severe challenges. For instance, many individuals in certain African nations lack basic necessities like food, water, and warm clothing, not to mention their unmet educational needs. The situation is even more dire for those living in countries ravaged by war or natural disasters, who must contend with issues such as insecurity, homelessness, and the profound grief of losing loved ones. It's evident that these individuals are in dire need of international support.While it's essential to help those beyond our borders, it's also reasonable to assist our fellow citizens. Charity organizations are primarily funded by their home country, which creates a legitimate expectation that the funds should be utilized within the country where they were collected. Additionally, even in the most developed nations, there are still individuals struggling to meet their basic needs. Addressing these domestic issues contributes to social stability and sustained economic growth.In conclusion, while it's crucial to provide international assistance to those from less fortunate countries, it's also necessary to help citizens within our own country. A balanced approach that considers both international and domestic needs is essential for creating a more equitable and supportive global community.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The learning methods of today's children have undergone a significant transformation compared to previous generations, largely due to the widespread availability and affordability of modern technology. Although some argue that traditional teaching methods are superior, I strongly believe that both alternative sources of knowledge and conventional educational approaches are equally vital for children's learning process.The proliferation of alternative knowledge sources has undoubtedly played a crucial role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers, for instance, can be programmed to generate an infinite number of questions across various fields, allowing students to learn and reinforce facts as they answer them. A notable example is the reading and listening sections of the TOEFL iBT exams, where candidates must respond to numerous questions within a limited timeframe. Furthermore, when students encounter academic difficulties, they can post their queries on websites and receive accurate responses from individuals across the globe without incurring any costs. Additionally, research that once required hours of searching through library shelves can now be conducted with the click of a button, highlighting the importance of technology in the learning process.On the other hand, educational institutions provide a structured environment where students can learn from both their peers and formal educators. Under the guidance of experienced teachers, students' development is systematically orchestrated, stage by stage, ensuring a comprehensive and supported acquisition of knowledge. Therefore, traditional education approaches are also indispensable.In conclusion, I firmly believe that alternative sources of information and traditional education systems are equally essential for children's development. To achieve the best learning outcomes, students should leverage both the knowledge imparted by teachers and the vast resources offered by modern technology. By combining these two approaches, students can maximize their learning potential and thrive in their academic pursuits.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";Global sporting events are a universal phenomenon, watched by nearly every country worldwide, fostering social interaction and community gathering. While some view these events as a means to bridge international gaps and resolve conflicts, others see them as mere entertainment, serving as a distraction from pressing issues. Personally, I believe that these events hold some significance, but are not indispensable.In reality, global sports competitions generate positive energy among a vast number of people. The primary purpose of these events is to evoke and share emotions among supporters of various teams, transcending local, national, and international boundaries. The football World Cup, held every four years, is a prime example of such an event, where people from diverse backgrounds come together to enjoy the experience.However, it's crucial to acknowledge that these sports events are not pivotal in addressing more substantial issues, such as politics or international relations. The peaceful and harmonious atmosphere during these events often belies the underlying complexities and tensions. Once the games conclude, the world reverts to its usual state, and the competitive fervor is forgotten by the majority. For instance, Putin's enthusiastic opening of the last Winter Olympics, which brought together international delegations, was merely a facade, as he subsequently disregarded international warnings and proceeded to annex Crimea.In conclusion, international sports events are a valuable means of uniting people, allowing them to take pride in their nationalities, and temporarily forget their troubles. Nonetheless, these events do not intersect with international affairs, and their impact is fleeting, lasting only as long as the competition itself.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The rapid advancement of information technology has made long-distance education a viable option, allowing individuals to learn from the comfort of their own homes without the need to physically attend school. This has sparked a heated debate about whether this approach is more beneficial to students than traditional methods. In my opinion, I firmly believe that students can reap more benefits from remote education.Firstly, studying at home offers pupils a significant amount of time and cost savings. By utilizing distance-learning programs, students can reduce their commuting time, tuition fees, and textbook costs, requiring only an internet connection. This is particularly advantageous for children living in remote areas and those from low-income families.Moreover, long-distance education provides students with access to a vast array of knowledge resources and diverse teaching methods. With just a click of a mouse, pupils can obtain curriculum materials, such as scientific reports, study guides, and documentaries. Students can even choose online courses tailored to their preferences and schedules, allowing them to control their learning pace and achieve satisfactory results.While traditional education has its strengths, including face-to-face interaction, mental stimulation, and physical education, which provide immediate feedback and contribute to the development of students' personalities, remote education can bridge the gap of distance and physical presence with advancements in streaming and sensor technologies.In conclusion, although I acknowledge that traditional education has certain advantages, such as feedback and inspiration, that are difficult to replicate, I believe that distance learning surpasses conventional methods in terms of efficiency, convenience, and economic value. Additionally, remote education enables self-regulated learning, allowing pupils to study at their own pace and purpose, making it a more beneficial option for students.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The threat of extinction looms over many animal species today, prompting a heated debate about the importance of conservation. Proponents of animal protection argue that preserving biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, as the loss of certain species can have a ripple effect, threatening other species, including humans. They believe it is our responsibility to safeguard the existence of as many species as possible.However, I disagree with this perspective. The theory of evolution suggests that species extinction is a natural process. The Earth's environment has undergone numerous transformations since the emergence of the first species, resulting in the inevitable extinction of many plants and animals that were unable to adapt. In most cases, extinction is an irreversible process that is beyond human control.Moreover, humans face numerous pressing issues, such as hunger, disease, and conflict, which demand our immediate attention. In comparison, the extinction of certain animal species seems relatively less significant. Given the limited resources at our disposal, it is impractical to allocate them to the conservation of species that are beyond salvation. Our primary concern should be ensuring the survival and well-being of our own species before considering the preservation of others.In conclusion, I firmly believe that human interests should take precedence over those of animals. It is more sensible to allow natural processes to unfold, rather than attempting to intervene in the inevitable course of species extinction. By prioritizing human needs and concerns, we can effectively address the pressing problems that threaten our own existence, rather than diverting resources to conservation efforts that may be futile in the face of natural selection.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;In the modern era, education stands out as the pivotal factor that ultimately shapes an individual's future. I strongly endorse the perspective that university admissions should be free from gender bias, ensuring equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their gender. Several compelling arguments support this stance.Firstly, the assessment of a student's capabilities should be grounded in their academic achievements and talents, rather than their gender. Today, both male and female students exhibit equal competitiveness, deserving of recognition for their outstanding performances across various educational disciplines. For instance, in India, female students frequently secure the majority of top scorer positions in higher secondary school examinations, demonstrating their academic prowess.Moreover, female students are increasingly interested in pursuing courses like mechanical engineering, which require physical engagement in lab workshops, a departure from traditional gender roles. Additionally, due to heightened awareness of current affairs and advancements in technology, female graduates are more inclined to assume significant responsibilities in the workplace, including those that come with intense pressure and stress. A notable example is Chanda Kochhar, the CEO of ICICI Bank, India's second-largest bank, who has been recognized as one of the most powerful female leaders in the business sector.In conclusion, I firmly believe that all students, regardless of gender, should have equal opportunities to pursue their educational aspirations in any university subject, provided they meet the requisite qualifications. The government should implement measures to regulate the admission process, ensuring that all students can benefit from higher education without facing gender-based limitations. This approach will not only promote gender equality but also harness the full potential of the younger generation, contributing to the societal and economic development of the country.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate over whether face-to-face communication is superior to other forms of communication is a contentious and multifaceted issue, open to various interpretations due to its complexity. Opinions on this matter are divided, with some individuals believing that in-person communication is the most effective means of expression, while others hold the opposing view. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion on the matter, and I concur with the former: face-to-face communication is indeed superior.The primary reason for this stance lies in the undeniable fact that communicating in person can be more persuasive. Face-to-face interactions often lead to successful persuasion or resolution of issues, as exemplified by my uncle's experience. He once complained about a restaurant service, directly speaking to the manager about a meal that contained a fly. This face-to-face interaction resulted in a new service being provided. Had he simply written a complaint on the website or called on the phone, it's unlikely the issue would have been taken seriously. This anecdote illustrates the effectiveness of in-person communication.Another significant aspect to consider is the ease with which one can be deceived without face-to-face communication. For instance, I once received hurtful messages on Facebook from my best friend, Eric, stating that I had failed in our friendship and that he no longer wished to be friends. I was shocked and confused. Ultimately, it was discovered that his Facebook account had been hacked. This experience highlights the importance of face-to-face communication in avoiding misunderstandings and ensuring the authenticity of interactions.It is acknowledged that some individuals may argue that communicating through letters, email, or telephone allows for more uninhibited conversation, which they consider a crucial aspect of communication. However, in my view, the value of uninhibited speech is overstated. Before engaging in conversation, it is essential to be mindful of our words, as speaking without restraint can often be detrimental. Based on the reasons outlined above, I firmly believe that expressing oneself in person is preferable due to the significantly greater advantages it offers compared to other forms of communication. In other words, I am convinced that face-to-face communication is the best method. This is not to dismiss other viewpoints as entirely without merit, but rather, I am persuaded that the arguments I have presented in favor of face-to-face communication are more compelling and reasonable.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The advancement of technology has led to significant improvements in medical care, which in turn has played a crucial role in increasing life expectancy. While the rise in life expectancy may put some strain on the Medicare system, I firmly believe that the benefits of advanced medical care far outweigh its drawbacks.One of the primary advantages of high-tech medical care is that it enables people to receive better care, leading to improved health outcomes. This, in turn, allows them to contribute more effectively to the economy, as healthy workers are more productive. Moreover, they spend less time on health checks and treatments, resulting in significant time and cost savings.Furthermore, a community with healthy elderly members plays a vital role in sustainable social development. When older adults are in good health, it has a positive impact on younger generations, who can take comfort in knowing that their parents and grandparents are well. Ultimately, advancements in medical care lead to a better quality of life for everyone.Some argue that the increase in life expectancy puts a significant burden on the economic system, as more funds are allocated to Medicare rather than being invested in other sectors. While this is a valid concern, I believe that the funds spent on caring for the elderly are a worthwhile investment, as these individuals have contributed to society through their work and efforts during their productive years. It is the responsibility of governments and younger generations to ensure that the Medicare system is improved to provide adequate care for those who have earned it.In conclusion, the development of the healthcare system has a profoundly positive impact on people's lives, enabling them to build a sustainable society where they can live happily and healthily in their older age.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"The debate about whether successful individuals typically take risks or stick to what they know has been a longstanding and contentious issue. Due to its complexity, this topic can be approached from multiple angles, leading to diverse perspectives. Some believe that trying new, unfamiliar things is essential for success, while others argue that playing it safe with established knowledge is the key. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion, which aligns with the latter: successful people often achieve success by doing what they already know.The primary reason for this stance is the undeniable fact that minimizing risk is a crucial aspect of achieving success. By reducing the factors that could lead to failure, individuals increase their probability of success. Consider, for instance, a wealthy individual who has extensive knowledge of investments. They can focus on companies they believe are worthwhile, wait for stable returns, and avoid risky investments that could lead to financial ruin. This example illustrates that successful people do not necessarily need to take risks or try new things.Furthermore, another vital aspect is the capability to make informed decisions and overcome obstacles. A successful person should be able to analyze and dismantle hurdles that stand in their way. For example, sports stars do not need to resort to performance-enhancing drugs to win games or showcase their skills; their natural abilities in their sport are what lead to their success. In contrast, athletes who take risks by using drugs often fail to achieve their goals. This case supports the notion that taking risks is not a necessary component of success.Admittedly, there are those who argue that doing something new and different is essential for success, as it allows individuals to stand out from others. However, in my view, this perspective lacks prudence. While trying new things can indeed make someone special, it does not guarantee success. The distinction between being unique and being successful is crucial here.Based on the reasons outlined above, I firmly believe that doing what one already knows can still lead to success, primarily because the advantages of this approach outweigh those of the alternative. In essence, reducing risks and enhancing one's capabilities is the most critical path to success. This is not to say that other viewpoints are entirely without merit, but rather that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my perspective are more tenable and cogent. Ultimately, the strategy of minimizing risk and maximizing known strengths offers a more reliable and effective route to achieving success."
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;"The purpose of education is a contentious issue among individuals and society, particularly when it comes to higher education at the college or university level. While some people believe that all students deserve the opportunity to pursue higher education, I argue that it would be more beneficial to reserve this type of training for a select group of talented and knowledgeable learners.Firstly, focusing on talented students is a better approach because it enables academic institutions to maintain their high standards of education. Unlike middle school or high school, universities and colleges require a significant amount of ability and skills to keep up with the vast amount of complex knowledge. In reality, some students may excel in high school, but the pressure of higher education can be overwhelming, even for the most talented individuals. This is why I believe that higher education is only suitable for a limited number of people, and opening it up to everyone would be detrimental to institutions, as they would need to dilute the curriculum to make it accessible to all.Secondly, universities should only accept talented students because it provides better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some argue that this approach may lead to social division, where highly educated individuals refuse to take on ""low-level"" jobs. However, I believe that this approach does no harm to the community. Standard jobs will always be available to everyone, while complex tasks should be handled by the most capable individuals, who have been educated at the best institutions. Limiting the number of students who can be admitted to universities is, in my opinion, a good decision, as it rewards motivated students and keeps them at a high level of learning, driving them to improve themselves constantly. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and provides the best individuals to serve the most critical needs of society.In conclusion, I agree that everyone should have access to compulsory education up to the high school level, but higher education should be reserved for the most talented students. This approach will improve the quality of both universities and students, ultimately placing individuals in positions that suit them best."
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"The question of whether universities should prioritize spending on upgrading facilities or hiring renowned professors is a highly contested issue, with multiple perspectives and complexities. While some individuals argue that schools should focus on investing in new facilities, others believe that hiring famous teachers is more beneficial for students. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion on the matter, and I firmly believe that spending on improving facilities is the better option.The primary reason for this stance is that advanced facilities provide students with greater opportunities for knowledge acquisition. For instance, a well-equipped library offers students a tranquil environment to study and research, with access to a vast array of references. Such facilities significantly enhance the learning experience, making a strong case for the benefits of investing in them. Furthermore, students engage in various activities beyond the classroom, and improved facilities can greatly support these endeavors. Consider a student who is part of the school's jazz ensemble; a superior auditorium would enable them to deliver an exceptional performance, resulting in a valuable and memorable experience. This example illustrates that students can greatly benefit from investments in facilities, which would likely be their preference.On the other hand, some argue that hiring prestigious teachers is the better use of funds, as they can provide superior instruction. However, in my view, the impact of a teacher is not the sole determining factor in a student's success. A student's performance is ultimately dependent on their individual effort, not solely on the teacher's fame or abilities. Hiring a renowned teacher to instruct unmotivated students would be ineffective, as the outcome depends more on the student's dedication to their studies.Based on the arguments presented, I conclude that enhancing facilities is the superior choice for educational institutions, as the advantages of this approach outweigh those of hiring famous professors. In essence, students can derive more benefits from improved facilities. This is not to dismiss the validity of opposing viewpoints entirely, but rather to assert that the reasons I have outlined in support of my position are more compelling and logical."
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;Some argue that high schools should give students the freedom to choose their own courses, as this can motivate them to learn. However, I believe that students should be required to study a wide range of subjects, from literature to mathematics. This broad-based education will prepare them for specialized studies at university and also help them to avoid missing out on valuable opportunities.Firstly, students need to explore various fields of study to discover their true interests. Without trying out different subjects, they may miss out on a potentially successful career path. For example, a student who thinks they want to study mathematics may find that they have a hidden talent for philosophy. By studying a range of subjects, students can make informed decisions about their future majors.Moreover, acquiring knowledge from multiple academic fields is essential for future success. General education plays a crucial role in specialized education, as it provides a foundation for more advanced studies. Today's scientists, for instance, need to combine knowledge from chemistry, physics, and other subjects to solve complex problems. Even textbooks in higher education, which may be labeled as specific subjects, often require a basic understanding of other disciplines. For instance, understanding physics is often necessary to comprehend chemistry texts. Therefore, high school students should be encouraged to study broadly, preparing them for future learning at university.Lastly, students often tend to avoid challenges and may opt for easier courses, which can limit their future opportunities. To prevent this, schools should take responsibility for guiding students' futures by providing a well-planned curriculum. This will protect students from making decisions that may harm their long-term prospects.In conclusion, students should be encouraged to explore various subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare for higher education. High schools must also take responsibility for their students' futures by providing a curriculum that challenges and prepares them for success.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;As individuals mature, debates about the significance of games emerge. Some argue that adults require gaming just as children do. However, in my view, games lose their importance for adults due to several key factors.Firstly, games become less essential for people as they embark on their careers. While some may contend that games help adults unwind and achieve a better work-life balance, the reality is that the demands of work and family commitments often force them to abandon their long-standing hobbies. Consequently, they can no longer devote the necessary time and effort to their favorite games as they once did in their youth. For instance, in my country, aside from a small minority of professional athletes, most people cease to engage in games seriously once they secure a decent job, finding them more bothersome than enjoyable in their daily lives.Another significant reason is that adults typically do not engage in games with the same competitive spirit as children. Youngsters are naturally inclined towards competition and winning, which fosters outstanding traits such as perseverance, regardless of whether they participate in sports or not. My younger sister, for example, is passionate about fencing, and her desire to win motivates her to persevere even when faced with adversity or injury. In contrast, adults often view such competitive behaviors as immature and promptly discard them. In fact, highly competitive individuals often struggle to collaborate with peers and colleagues, leading them to lose interest in games that do not offer substantial achievements.In conclusion, while I believe adults do benefit from playing games, their approach to gaming is often distinctly different from that of children, focusing more on enjoyment and less on competition. Given the high demands of family and work life, games serve as leisure activities for adults, rather than a necessity as they are for children.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";The concept of a unified world culture is a topic of debate, with some arguing that it's impossible for all countries to share a single culture. However, I believe that modern technology is paving the way for a global culture to emerge, and here's why.First and foremost, the widespread adoption of technology has led to a convergence of educational systems worldwide. Many countries now employ similar teaching methods, where students are tasked with researching topics online, typing up their findings on computers, and presenting their work using software like PowerPoint. For instance, students in Iran use the same Microsoft software as their Canadian counterparts to complete homework and presentations. This homogenization of educational tools and methods is a significant step towards cultural unification.Secondly, the rise of new technologies has created a global job market, with certain professions in high demand across the globe. Computer technology, in particular, is a rapidly growing field, and students are being encouraged to pursue careers in this area. This is evident in countries like Canada, where immigrants with degrees in computer technology can easily find well-paying jobs. The fact that technology-related jobs are in high demand worldwide underscores the similarities in career opportunities across cultures.Some might counter that certain cultural aspects, such as cuisine, are unique to each culture and immune to technological influence. While this point has some validity, it's worth noting that many countries, like Canada, the USA, and the UK, have a diverse range of restaurants serving dishes from various cultures. Moreover, the internet has made it easier than ever for cooks to discover new recipes from around the world. For example, I recently visited a Canadian restaurant and enjoyed Chinese noodles, sushi, and a Greek salad - a testament to the globalization of food culture.In conclusion, modern technology is indeed bridging cultural gaps and creating a more unified world culture. Its impact is evident in educational systems, job markets, and even the way we experience and share food. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more similarities emerge across cultures, ultimately contributing to a more interconnected and globalized world.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The path to success is influenced by a multitude of factors, and the debate about which one holds the most sway is ongoing. Many argue that in today's world, assistance from family members is a crucial element in achieving success. It appears that having family support can significantly ease the journey to success. I concur with this viewpoint, believing that family plays a pivotal role in helping individuals pursue and attain success. Several reasons underpin this perspective.Firstly, the increasing accessibility of university education has empowered more people to acquire higher learning, thereby enhancing their ability to offer valuable advice and assistance in their children's careers. Unlike in the past, when opportunities for higher education were scarce, current generations have the benefit of more educated parents. For instance, my grandparents lacked even a high school education, forcing my father to seek help from his teachers when faced with difficulties. In contrast, I have grown up in a more advantageous environment, where I can readily seek guidance from my parents, who possess a broader knowledge base to address my problems swiftly.Furthermore, family members provide multifaceted support beyond academic advice. When I was undecided about my university major, my father shared his experiences and insights about different fields of study, significantly aiding my decision-making process. Parents, with their accumulated experience, are better positioned to guide their children towards the right path. They can impart their knowledge and wish to see their children progress, making them indispensable resources for growth and development.In essence, the support and guidance from parents and other family members are invaluable in navigating life's challenges and striving for success. I firmly believe that with the backing of family, achieving success becomes a more attainable and less daunting task.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"The topic of hobbies sparks a multitude of opinions, with some individuals preferring to spend their leisure time watching TV. However, I firmly believe that reading fiction is a more enjoyable and rewarding hobby than watching movies, and I'd like to outline the reasons why.First and foremost, fiction books offer a level of detail and depth that movies simply can't match. Through reading, we can gain a thorough understanding of characters, settings, and plot developments, which are often meticulously described in novels. This is particularly evident in novels that feature complex characters and subplots, where every scene is carefully crafted to reveal more about the story and its inhabitants. For instance, after reading ""Animal Farm,"" a allegory of the Russian Revolution, I developed a nuanced understanding of the key leaders and various factions of the Russian people. In contrast, movies often provide only a superficial glimpse into the story and its characters, lacking the depth and complexity of their literary counterparts.Another significant advantage of reading fiction is its convenience. Many novels are compact, with some spanning around 100 pages, making them easy to carry and read in short intervals, such as during commutes or while waiting. I've recently started reading a novel, and due to my busy schedule, I can only dedicate short periods to reading, often during my daily commute home from English class. This flexibility is particularly useful, as it allows me to make progress with my reading even when I have limited time. Watching a movie, on the other hand, requires a significant time commitment, which can be challenging to find, especially when faced with other responsibilities like studying.Some might argue that watching TV, particularly movies, can be an effective way to learn new things, such as languages. While this point has some validity, I believe that movies are not the ideal resource for language beginners. The fast and often unclear dialogue in movies can be overwhelming for those trying to learn a new language. In such cases, reading novels can be a more accessible and enjoyable way to start learning, as the pace is determined by the reader, and the language is often more comprehensible.In conclusion, reading fiction stands out as a more pleasant and rewarding hobby than watching movies due to its depth, convenience, and utility for language learners. Fiction books offer a rich and detailed experience that can be savored at the reader's pace, making them an ideal choice for those seeking an engaging and fulfilling hobby."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The English language has become a widely accepted and commonly used language globally, with its usage increasing exponentially. As a result, many local languages are facing the threat of extinction. While some individuals view this as a positive development, facilitating easier communication among people, others are concerned about the demise of local languages. In my opinion, I firmly believe that the adoption of a single language worldwide is a positive change that is contributing to making the world a better place to live in.A world with fewer languages enhances our ability to interact with one another more effectively. With the advent of globalization, numerous people are traveling for professional purposes, and communicating in a single language simplifies daily activities such as ordering food or navigating unfamiliar places. Moreover, students who migrate for better educational opportunities will face less stress as they can easily forge new friendships and participate in discussions, which would be challenging in a multilingual world. This, in turn, facilitates adjustment to new environments. The use of a single language also minimizes misunderstandings between individuals. Additionally, the exchange of knowledge in various research sectors, including electronics, medicine, and astronomy, becomes more effortless.On the other hand, some individuals are concerned about the decline of local languages, which serve as the foundation for cultural communication and representation. These languages are intricately linked to history, and the loss of these languages would render ancient literature and scripts indecipherable. However, I firmly believe that change is inevitable, and the adoption of a single language worldwide is a positive development. Embracing this change is essential for creating a better world, where communication in a single language enhances global productivity and unifies people across the globe.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The world is constantly evolving, and humans play a significant role in shaping their environment, leading to inevitable changes. Some people, particularly the elderly, may feel that the past was better than the present, believing that the modern world has lost its charm. However, I strongly disagree with this sentiment, citing technological and medical advancements as evidence.We are living in an era where technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, making the world a more convenient and interconnected place. A notable example is the invention of smartphones, which have revolutionized the way we navigate and communicate. The robust navigation systems on these devices have saved countless lives, especially for those stranded in remote areas like forests or deserts. While some critics argue that social media has eroded face-to-face relationships, I believe that platforms like Facebook have actually strengthened bonds between friends and family members who are physically apart, facilitating communication that was previously impossible.The remarkable progress in medical science over the last decade has been a groundbreaking achievement, making the world a healthier and happier place. Thanks to the tireless efforts of biomedical engineers and neurologists, people with severe spinal injuries can now regain mobility and engage in physical activities like walking. Furthermore, advancements in drug delivery systems have led to the development of targeted therapies, where medications can be delivered directly to damaged organs, marking a significant breakthrough. The increase in human lifespan, from approximately 50 to 75 years, over the past few decades, serves as a testament to the success of medical advancements.In conclusion, while some older individuals may nostalgically claim that their generation had stronger, more meaningful relationships, I believe they are judging the present through a biased lens. Considering the aforementioned facts, it is clear that the current world offers higher living standards, with people enjoying better social and physical conditions. The notion that the past was better is, in my opinion, a misconception, and I firmly believe that we are living in a better world than ever before.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;It is undeniable that money plays a more significant role in our lives now than it did in the past. The idea of teaching financial management to young students is a subject of ongoing debate. While some believe that educating teenagers about money management will help them appreciate its importance, others think that introducing children to financial concepts at a young age could have adverse effects. In my opinion, I firmly believe that high school students should be taught about money management.The primary reason I think teenagers need to learn about money management is that when they reach the age of attending college or university, they often have to live away from home, either in hostels or with friends. By teaching money management skills at an early age, students will develop a greater sense of responsibility and confidence in handling their finances. For instance, when I was a child, my father would maintain a monthly expense log, and I was encouraged to do the same to track my pocket money expenses. This practice, which I developed at a young age, has been helpful in planning my expenses throughout my life.Additionally, introducing financial management concepts at a young age will give students a better understanding of their family's financial situation and background. This, in turn, will minimize the likelihood of students having unrealistic expectations and desires. For example, buying a gaming console might not be a significant expense for a student from a wealthy background, but for a student from a middle-class family, it might not be a priority. Therefore, being exposed to money management techniques at a high school level will enable them to prioritize their financial commitments more efficiently.In conclusion, I believe that teaching students about money management techniques will have more positive outcomes than negative consequences. However, it is essential to teach these concepts in a constructive and supportive manner, avoiding making students feel guilty or anxious about every expense they make.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;The decision to live with a roommate or reside alone is a dilemma that many single individuals face, with each person having their own unique preferences and priorities. While some value the privacy that comes with living alone, others opt for the practicality of sharing a space with a roommate. Personally, I lean towards the latter, and my reasons are rooted in the financial, social, and supportive benefits it offers.One of the most significant advantages of living with a roommate is the financial savings. When you share a living space, expenses such as rent and utilities can be divided among roommates, leading to significant cost reductions. For instance, my experience of sharing a room off-campus with a friend last year resulted in substantial savings. We split the rent and heating bills equally, which meant I saved around $50 on heating and $200 on rent each month. This kind of cost-cutting is especially beneficial when considering the wastefulness of heating and maintaining a large space alone.Beyond the financial perks, living with a roommate also facilitates easier socialization. Being in a shared living environment naturally lends itself to more social interactions. For example, when my roommate, Millan, brought his friends over one evening, we quickly bonded over our shared love of video games, spending the night playing 'Halo' together. Such interactions not only lead to fun times but also foster meaningful friendships, showcasing how living with roommates can enrich one's social life.Lastly, another crucial benefit of living with a roommate is the access to help and expertise that comes with it. Roommates often possess a variety of skills and knowledge that can be invaluable in times of need. When my computer suddenly malfunctioned, for instance, after receiving no help from the manufacturer, one of my roommates stepped in with his computer skills and quickly resolved the issue. This kind of immediate, expert assistance is hard to come by when living alone.In conclusion, while personal preferences may sway some towards living alone, I firmly believe in the benefits of living with a roommate. The combination of reduced expenses, enhanced social opportunities, and readily available help makes shared living not only practical but also preferable for those seeking to make the most out of their living situation. For single individuals aiming to enjoy their lives to the fullest, I recommend embracing the roommate lifestyle, as it offers a unique blend of financial prudence, social engagement, and mutual support that can significantly enhance one's quality of life.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;Smoking has never been beneficial for the human body. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cigars contain harmful ingredients that can cause significant harm. Despite claims from smokers that it enhances their productivity or creativity, there is no evidence to suggest that smoking has any benefits for human health. In my opinion, smoking should be strictly prohibited, especially in public places like restaurants, as it can cause discomfort and harm to non-smokers.Firstly, restaurants are establishments where people pay to enjoy their meals, and smoking can significantly disrupt this experience. The presence of smoke can make it impossible for others to fully appreciate their food, creating an unpleasant environment. Furthermore, restaurants are often family-friendly environments, where children, grandparents, and pregnant women are present. Smoking in these settings can set a bad example for children, who are highly impressionable and may imitate adult behavior. Additionally, smoking can exacerbate health issues in elderly individuals, particularly those with pre-existing heart and lung problems. Pregnant women are also at significant risk, as inhaling contaminated air can disrupt fetal development.Lastly, passive smokers are also at risk of developing serious health problems, including stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and various types of cancer, simply by being in close proximity to active smokers. This is particularly unfair, as passive smokers do not smoke themselves yet still face similar health risks as active smokers.In conclusion, smoking should be strictly prohibited in restaurants, as it can cause significant harm and discomfort to many individuals. State laws that ban smoking in public places should be enforced, allowing restaurant management to establish clear no-smoking policies and ensuring that everyone has the right to enjoy their meals in a safe and healthy environment.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;It is evident that violent behavior has become increasingly prevalent in films over the past 20 years, and this trend has been exploited as a marketing tool to promote movies. From my perspective, I firmly believe that violence in films has a detrimental impact on young people, particularly in terms of their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.First and foremost, children's behavior is a primary concern for parents, who strive to do their best to guide them. Nowadays, children are more exposed to TV programs, and if their favorite actor engages in violent roles, they are likely to imitate this behavior in an attempt to emulate them. As a result, violent behavior can unintentionally influence children's actions.Moreover, humans, especially young people, are highly sensitive. For instance, death is a distressing event, and killing is even more disturbing. If such scenes are depicted on TV, they can have a profound negative impact on young viewers. The emotional toll of exposure to violence can be significant, and it is crucial to consider the potential consequences.Finally, in addition to the aforementioned points, a child's academic performance should also be carefully monitored. For example, if a child watches a frightening movie, they may struggle to concentrate on their studies, particularly if they have an upcoming exam. The lingering effects of the movie can preoccupy their mind, making it challenging for them to focus on their academic tasks. Consequently, their academic performance can suffer significantly.In conclusion, I strongly assert that the growing presence of violence in films undoubtedly has negative effects on young people, particularly in terms of their academic performance, emotions, and behavior. Therefore, I believe that this issue should be addressed through parental guidance or regulation by film directors to mitigate the potential harm.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"In today's world, information has become a valuable commodity that can be bought, sold, or stolen. The phrase ""information is power"" has never been more relevant, emphasizing the importance of being well-informed. I strongly agree with this statement for several compelling reasons.Firstly, verifying information through multiple sources is crucial in ensuring its accuracy. Some individuals may intentionally disseminate false information, making it imprudent to draw conclusions without being certain of the facts. For instance, during the conflict between Ossetia and Georgia, Russian news outlets reported that Georgia was the aggressor, while European news sources blamed Russia. It wasn't until later, when the situation became clearer, that the truth emerged, but by then, many people had already condemned Russia's actions.Secondly, having access to factual information about events or issues, rather than just estimates or opinions, is vital in forming our own conclusions or judgments. However, finding reliable facts can be challenging, especially on the internet, where misinformation can spread quickly. Therefore, it's essential to consult multiple sources to increase the chances of finding accurate information. Relying solely on someone's personal opinion or unverified information can lead to incorrect decisions. For example, a few years ago in Moscow, the price of salt doubled in just one week due to rumors that it would soon be unavailable in stores. This gossip-based information had a significant impact on prices, and it wasn't until an official announcement was made that the ""salt panic"" subsided.In conclusion, it's crucial to be confident in the information we use, especially when our conclusions or decisions have the potential to significantly impact outcomes. Being well-informed is not just a matter of personal benefit, but also a responsibility that can help mitigate the spread of misinformation and its potentially harmful consequences."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The preservation of historic buildings is a contentious issue for governments, as it often pits the need for housing and development against the desire to protect cultural heritage. In my opinion, all buildings that contribute significantly to our cultural identity should be preserved.There are valid arguments against restoring old buildings. The rapid urbanization process, which has led to an influx of people moving to cities in search of job opportunities, has created a pressing need for housing. As a result, governments may prioritize constructing new accommodations over preserving old buildings. Additionally, the preservation of old buildings is a costly endeavor, as each component has historical value.On the other hand, old buildings are an integral part of our history and cultural heritage. Tourists often visit a country to experience its culture, and historic buildings are a major draw. By preserving these buildings, city managers can generate revenue from tourism, which can then be invested in conservation efforts. Moreover, preserving old buildings is a way to safeguard our cultural heritage, allowing future generations to learn from and appreciate them. These buildings can be repurposed as cultural museums or adapted to provide modern accommodations, striking a balance between preservation and functionality.Many cities have development strategies that aim to blend unique, historic charm with modern amenities, and preserving old buildings is a crucial part of this process. Ultimately, both perspectives have merit: the need for housing and the expense of restoration must be weighed against the importance of preserving cultural heritage and attracting tourism. However, I believe that restoring old buildings is essential, as they embody the most distinctive features of the areas in which they are located.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;In today's world, many young people rely heavily on their mobile phones, which they believe help them stay organized and connected to their loved ones. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that mobile phones are a positive influence on the younger generation.First and foremost, the constant presence of mobile phones can be a significant distraction for young students. The numerous games and applications available on these devices can consume a substantial amount of their time, leaving them with limited hours to focus on their studies and other academic activities. Moreover, internet-enabled phones can further divert their attention towards social media and online chatting, rather than their schoolwork. I can attest to this from personal experience, having once become addicted to a mobile game during my college days. My obsession with reaching a higher level to impress my friends led me to neglect my homework, resulting in a failed subject that semester.Additionally, young mobile phone users often develop materialistic tendencies. They are drawn to purchasing phones not only for their functionality but also for their brand reputation, which can come at a substantial cost. Since most of these young individuals are students, they often rely on their parents for financial support, which can be a significant burden. It's not uncommon to see teenagers owning high-end phones worth twice their parents' monthly salary, illustrating the unfortunate trend of prioritizing material possessions over other essential values.In conclusion, the negative consequences of mobile phone usage can have detrimental effects on a person's education and character development. Therefore, I strongly advise young people to be cautious of their mobile phone dependency and maintain a balance between their use of technology and other aspects of their lives.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The primary purpose of punishment is to deter crime and instill fear in the minds of offenders,. Some argue that the motivation behind a crime is irrelevant and that a fixed punishment should be imposed for each specific offense. However, I disagree and believe that the circumstances and conditions that drive an individual to commit a crime should be taken into account.Firstly, implementing fixed punishments for each type of crime could lead to an increase in crime rates. Professional criminals would be well aware of the consequences and would not be deterred from committing crimes. Additionally, laws and regulations are designed to serve the people, and it is essential to consider the context of a crime. For instance, a woman who steals food to feed her child should not be treated the same as a woman who steals to support her drug addiction. Furthermore, first-time offenders and professional criminals should not be imprisoned together, as this could exacerbate the problem.On the other hand, fixed punishments could streamline the judicial process, reducing the time and cost associated with trials. This approach could also promote equality, as it would ensure that everyone is treated fairly, regardless of their financial situation. Unfortunately, the current system can be biased towards those who cannot afford quality legal representation, leading to unjust imprisonments. In such cases, fixed punishments might help bridge the gap between the rich and the poor, promoting a sense of mutual respect and understanding.In conclusion, I firmly believe that punishments should be determined on a case-by-case basis. By adopting this approach, governments can work towards eliminating crime from their nations. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of every individual to uphold the truth and respect the laws enshrined in our constitution.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;Many people unwind by participating in leisure activities, with some preferring to spend their free time indoors. However, based on my personal experience, I strongly believe that spending leisure time outdoors is beneficial for one's health and fitness. Outdoor activities not only allow me to stay physically fit, but they also provide opportunities to socialize with others and appreciate the beauty of nature.There are several advantages to spending leisure time outdoors. One significant benefit is that engaging in outdoor activities, such as soccer and baseball, is excellent for one's health. For instance, last summer, I spent my time playing these sports, which helped develop my upper body strength through hitting and throwing in baseball, and my lower body endurance through kicking and playing full 90-minute soccer games. I firmly believe that practicing these sports greatly improved my health, kept my body fit, and left me feeling refreshed. As a result, my body became stronger, and my endurance improved significantly after that summer.Outdoor activities not only enhance my physical health but also offer me chances to interact with more people. When I was ten, I was a shy girl, and my mother enrolled me in The National Camp. Initially, I kept to myself, but on the third day, while swimming, I met a friendly girl who greeted me, and we became friends. She taught me how to swim effectively, and the next day, we played together, and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities like skiing and mountain climbing, I made many friends since attending The National Camp. If I hadn't participated in that camp, I wouldn't have made as many friends as I have today.Furthermore, outdoor activities like hiking, sunbathing, and biking allow individuals to enjoy the beauty of nature. Spending time outdoors enables people to breathe fresh air, feel the warmth of the sun, and experience the tranquility that only nature can provide. In contrast, staying indoors prevents one from appreciating the natural world.Although indoor activities, such as reading, watching TV, or listening to music, can be enjoyable, their appeal cannot outweigh the benefits of outdoor activities for me. Ultimately, people have their own preferences, and I choose to spend my leisure time outdoors. While indoor activities can be fun, I believe that the advantages of outdoor activities make them a more attractive option for me.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;In recent years, numerous airlines have been offering an increasing number of affordable flights to their customers. The concept of cheap air travel has sparked a range of opinions among people. While there are valid arguments in favor of promoting this trend, I personally believe that cheap flights can lead to several significant problems.It is undeniable that inexpensive air fares have expanded travel opportunities for many individuals, particularly those with lower incomes. Nowadays, millions of people can travel globally for work or leisure, which enables them to advance their careers, broaden their knowledge, and interact with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, travel helps promote the development of the tourism industry, boosting the economies and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, the growth of cheap flights has a negative impact on the environment. Evidently, an increase in flights results in larger and busier airports, which can lead to increased air pollution for those living and working nearby. However, the primary concern is the effect on global warming. The combustion of plane fuel releases carbon dioxide into the environment, causing the Earth to heat up. Notably, while efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, little is being done to restrain the airlines.In conclusion, I argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. Nevertheless, this does not imply that air travel should become more expensive. Rather, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices. 
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;While both big cities and small towns have their advantages, I personally prefer living in a big city for several reasons. On the one hand, I have always aspired to work for a large company located in a thriving city area, and living close to my workplace is a priority for convenience and to save on transportation costs.On the other hand, city life is more dynamic and offers access to modern amenities and advanced facilities. For instance, cities are home to museums, well-equipped libraries, and sports centers, providing a wide range of activities and learning opportunities that may be limited in smaller towns.Moreover, living in a big city exposes one to a vast array of information and stimuli, which can lead to more opportunities for personal and professional growth. The city is filled with advertisements and information on various products, services, and opportunities, whether through leaflets, big screens in commercial zones, or other media. This wealth of information can help individuals make informed decisions about employment, travel, education, and consumer choices.Another significant advantage of city living is the potential for better educational opportunities for children. Schools in big cities often receive more funding from local communities and the government, enabling them to invest in advanced teaching facilities and attract high-quality teachers. This, in turn, provides children with a better chance to receive high-quality education, which is crucial for their future development and success.In conclusion, for those seeking a convenient, modern, and stimulating lifestyle with access to a wide range of opportunities, facilities, and quality education for their children, a big city is the ideal place to call home. It offers a unique blend of personal and professional opportunities, educational resources, and lifestyle advantages that make it preferable to small town living.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;Firstly, training sessions offer employees a refreshing break from the office environment, allowing them to clear their minds. In a company setting, we often encounter stressful situations, such as dealing with difficult customers or receiving criticism from supervisors. Training classes provide an opportunity to unwind and socialize with colleagues, make new friends, and enjoy acquiring new knowledge.Secondly, employees feel valued when they receive training, as it demonstrates that their company is invested in their future development. This, in turn, encourages employees to consider a long-term career with the company. Additionally, being selected for training can evoke a sense of pride, especially when others do not have the same opportunity.Thirdly, professional training enhances job satisfaction by improving employees' business knowledge and confidence. With newfound expertise, employees are more likely to deliver excellent results, which contributes to their overall happiness and job satisfaction, as well as that of their supervisors.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has numerous benefits. It can help employees recharge, increase their job satisfaction, and focus on their work. Considering these factors, it is clear that training can be an effective motivator for encouraging further good work.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;Attending university classes is a significant part of a student's academic life. Nevertheless, the classroom is not the sole source of knowledge. Students can also acquire knowledge and skills through experience, libraries, and interactions with others. I firmly believe that attending classes should be optional for students, and I will outline the reasons for this stance.Firstly, mandatory class attendance may not be the most effective way for all students to learn. Some students may find that they can learn better through self-study or alternative sources outside the classroom. For instance, a friend of mine, who was in the same department as me, demonstrated exceptional learning capabilities and quickly grasped concepts in class. As a result, she rarely attended classes, opting instead to focus on topics she struggled with in the library. Her strategy paid off, as she achieved outstanding grades upon graduation.Secondly, students who already have a solid understanding of the course material should have the flexibility to manage their time more efficiently. In my own experience, I often skipped biology classes because my university did not require attendance, and I had already studied the topics beforehand. This allowed me to allocate the time to work on my chemistry research, which ultimately earned me an A+ grade in both biology and chemistry.In conclusion, I believe that students should be empowered to make informed decisions about how to allocate their time and manage their learning. By doing so, they will also need to develop strategies to mitigate any potential negative consequences of not attending classes. Ultimately, making class attendance optional will enable students to take ownership of their learning and make the most of their university experience.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;In a few years, I will be completing my university studies and will have to make a decision about where to live - in a small town or a big city. As someone who is keen to secure a good job and experience different aspects of life, I think I would prefer to reside in a city.Living in a big city presents numerous opportunities. Primarily, it will be easier for me to find a job in electrical engineering, as cities have a higher demand for professionals in this field, which deals with issues related to electricity supply.

The multitude of bars, cafes, and restaurants provides ample options to socialize with friends. Moreover, multinational cities boast restaurants serving diverse national cuisines, which is a significant advantage for me, given my fondness for Italian food - I would certainly visit any Italian restaurant in the city.Cities also offer a vibrant nightlife, with nightclubs being popular spots for young people to enjoy music, meet new friends, or simply unwind with a drink. The cultural scene in a metropolis is always engaging, with a plethora of museums that I, as an enthusiast, would delight in visiting to admire famous artworks and historical artifacts. On special occasions, cities often host free exhibitions that are open to anyone interested in art.Additionally, cities are equipped with superior medical facilities compared to rural areas, providing assurance that if I were to fall ill, I would have access to high-quality medical care.In conclusion, while small towns have the allure of natural beauty and clean air, big cities offer an unparalleled array of opportunities, entertainment, and cultural experiences. Weighing these benefits, my preference would be to live in a big city.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;"The emergence of computers is a significant outcome of advanced technological development. While some individuals argue that computers have added complexity and stress to life, others contend that they have made life more convenient and easier. In my opinion, computers have brought ease and convenience to our lives by facilitating access to information and enhancing communication quality.Firstly, computers, through the internet, have simplified our access to information. With computers, we can quickly gather relevant data, store it on our hard drives for as long as needed, and retrieve it when necessary. Search engines like Google and Yandex, with their numerous features tailored to the characteristics of the required information, enable rapid searches that yield results in mere minutes. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have transformed traditional information sources, reducing governmental control over information dissemination. Consequently, using computers saves us time in searching for information, and we can obtain it from diverse sources.Secondly, in today's globalized world, computers have expedited communication, making it faster, more visual, and cost-effective. Email enables messages to be delivered to anyone, anywhere in the world, within minutes. This method is also convenient as it eliminates the need to physically visit a post office; instead, one can simply click their computer's mouse from the comfort of their home to reach friends and family worldwide. Internet facilities like MSN and Skype have made visual communication possible. For instance, via Skype, people can not only communicate with friends and family but also conduct job interviews and university enrollment interviews. As a result, communication has become cheaper, faster, and more visual.Lastly, I firmly believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient by broadening information sources, quickening access, and improving communication quality in multiple ways. The advent of computers has undoubtedly enhanced the convenience and ease of living in the modern world."
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;While some individuals believe that working from home provides excessive convenience for employees, I disagree. Often, the ideal working conditions are not as beneficial as people expect. In fact, working without pressure and social interaction can be significant drawbacks. Pressure, for instance, serves as a motivator, driving employees to perform at their best. Office environments, with their established rules and deadlines, foster a sense of responsibility among workers. Directors and managers oversee projects, setting deadlines that employees must meet, which encourages them to work diligently.In contrast, working from home can lack this sense of urgency and accountability. Although technology, such as computers and modems, enables remote work, it also introduces distractions like social media platforms, including Facebook and Yahoo. These entertainment websites can hinder concentration and productivity. Offices, on the other hand, have rules in place to minimize such distractions, allowing employees to stay focused. Moreover, working alone at home can lead to boredom and fatigue, making it easier for employees to fall asleep, which can delay project completion.Another significant advantage of office environments is the opportunity for interaction among colleagues. Collaborative discussions and debates enhance workability, as collective efforts can expedite the achievement of targets. Furthermore, interacting with coworkers improves communication skills, leading to stronger friendships and professional relationships. Interaction is a crucial factor in elevating work quality.In conclusion, working from home has several disadvantages, including a lack of pressure, limited interaction, and increased distractions. These factors should be carefully considered by those contemplating remote work arrangements. Ultimately, the perceived convenience of working from home may not outweigh the benefits of a traditional office setting.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;In today's academic landscape, many professors balance teaching responsibilities with research endeavors. While research can secure funding and advance knowledge in their field, it often comes at the expense of teaching time. In my opinion, professors should prioritize course preparation over research.First and foremost, professors have a responsibility to facilitate students' knowledge acquisition. Their primary duty is to nurture students and develop high-quality courses. Excessive time devoted to research can compromise course preparation, potentially diminishing the overall quality of instruction. Students enroll in universities to acquire cutting-edge knowledge, and professors should provide well-prepared courses that convey state-of-the-art information. Therefore, professors should focus on effective teaching methods rather than research.On the other hand, neglecting course preparation in favor of research can damage a university's reputation. Students may express dissatisfaction with unprepared courses, leading to declining enrollment. This, in turn, can make it challenging for professors to secure assistants for their projects, ultimately hindering the academic field as a whole. Consequently, prioritizing student development is more crucial for professors than pursuing research.However, research can be an effective teaching tool. Some students benefit from participating in research projects, gaining hands-on experience with equipment and inventing their own work. For instance, electronics students can develop practical skills by designing and building innovative devices like robots, MP3 players, and remote control cars. Moreover, some students may even receive recognition for their inventive work. Nevertheless, this is only feasible when students have mastered systematic knowledge, emphasizing the importance of high-quality courses. In other words, professors should focus on preparing engaging classes.In conclusion, research can be beneficial for both professors and students to some extent. However, the prerequisite for successful research is a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge. By developing students' skills and knowledge, we can foster a more robust academic environment. Professors can strike a balance between research and course preparation, ultimately enhancing the academic field.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;Over the past few decades, numerous groundbreaking advancements in technology have had a profound impact on society and individuals, yielding both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, technological developments have been a catalyst for economic growth and improved living standards. The innovations of scientists and engineers have led to the creation of novel products and tools that play a vital role in economic activities. The advent of internet technology and air transportation has enabled businessmen to facilitate international trade and financial transactions with ease. This, in turn, has allowed many countries to efficiently export their products worldwide, thereby increasing their revenue.Moreover, advanced technology has enabled individuals to enhance their standard of living and access to healthcare. The significant improvements in medical technology have led to a notable increase in life expectancy in many countries, with many serious diseases being brought under control. The development of digital entertainment technology has also provided people with new avenues for enjoyment, such as interactive video games and 3D movies, contributing to an overall increase in happiness.On the other hand, the development of technology also poses significant environmental and societal risks. The application of architectural technology to expand urban areas and the use of drilling technology by fuel companies to extract large amounts of fossil oil from natural regions threaten the ecology and environment. Furthermore, the proliferation of vehicle technology has led to increased private car ownership, resulting in exhaust gas emissions that contribute to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, while technological progress is accompanied by corresponding challenges, its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks, providing society with numerous advantages that ultimately improve the quality of life.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's society, it is essential for governments to prioritize the well-being of their citizens by providing accessible healthcare and health education. I strongly advocate for allocating a larger portion of health budgets to health education and preventive measures. There are several compelling reasons to support this approach. Firstly, investing in health education and prevention can significantly improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By reducing the number of patients, hospitals and healthcare centers can manage their resources more effectively, leading to better treatment outcomes for those in need. Educating the public about health issues enables individuals to take proactive measures to prevent illnesses, rather than relying on treatment after they have fallen ill. This,'t wait-and-see' approach not only reduces the burden on healthcare facilities but also promotes a healthier population.Secondly, prioritizing health education and prevention is crucial for the overall welfare of society. Health is a fundamental aspect of human life, and it is the foundation upon which happiness and well-being are built. Therefore, governments have a responsibility to provide their citizens with the knowledge and tools necessary to prevent illnesses that can cause suffering and misery. For instance, the Turkish Ministry of Health's anti-smoking campaign among young people led to improved well-being and lifestyle changes among those who quit smoking after the campaign. This example demonstrates the positive impact that targeted health education and prevention initiatives can have on public health.In conclusion, to achieve a more effective healthcare system and a higher level of societal well-being, governments should allocate a greater proportion of their health budgets to education and prevention rather than treatment alone. By doing so, they can create a healthier, more informed population that is better equipped to prevent illnesses and lead fulfilling lives.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;When it comes to choosing a place to live while attending university, students are often faced with two popular options: living in a university dormitory or renting an apartment in the city. Both options have their pros and cons, but after weighing the factors of freedom, studying conditions, and cost, I would personally prefer to live in an apartment in the community over living in a university dormitory.One of the primary advantages of living in an apartment is the increased level of freedom it provides. Unlike dormitories, which come with a set of predetermined rules, an apartment allows you to create your own rules and schedule. This means you have the freedom to receive visitors at any time or enjoy alone time whenever you want. Additionally, apartments offer more privacy, as you can choose to have your own room, rather than sharing with a roommate. This also translates to more space, which is often limited in dormitories.From a financial perspective, some people argue that apartments are more expensive. However, this can be mitigated by renting out extra rooms to other individuals, which can significantly reduce the cost. Another consideration is transportation, as you will need to commute to and from the university daily. Using public transportation is a cost-effective option, while having a car provides the freedom to create your own schedule and choose your destination, although it comes with a higher price tag.In terms of studying conditions, apartments have the upper hand. Without the noise and distractions that often come with dormitory living, such as loud music or unexpected visitors, you can focus better on your studies. Moreover, as you are not bound by a roommate's schedule, you have the flexibility to create your own study routine, whether that means studying late at night, playing music, or hosting friends. On the other hand, living in a dormitory and being surrounded by fellow students has its advantages, such as easy access to help with academic issues.In conclusion, while both options have their benefits, I firmly believe that the advantages of living in an apartment outweigh those of living in a dormitory. The freedom, privacy, and flexibility that come with apartment living make it the preferable choice for me.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;Have you ever had the opportunity to see a bear or a monkey up close? Chances are, it was at a zoo. Zoos are large outdoor spaces that house various animal species, allowing people to observe, learn from, and appreciate them. Many people believe that zoos serve no purpose, but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, zoos provide essential benefits, including social interaction, education, and the development of qualities like respect and understanding for animals.Visiting a zoo is often a group activity, whether with family or as part of a school trip. This setting encourages social interaction among visitors, who can relax, observe the animals, and engage with each other. In today's fast-paced world, families rarely spend quality time together, making a zoo visit an excellent excuse for a fun, family-bonding experience that can be enjoyed by all, from young children to grandparents.Zoos also play a significant role in education. While books and lectures are valuable learning tools, visual and personal experiences are even more effective. By visiting a zoo, you can observe animals in their habitats, learn about their behavior, diet, and unique characteristics. You can see different species, including males, females, and young, and witness their reactions to various situations, such as interacting with other species or protecting their young. This hands-on experience can even help students better understand the concepts they learn in school.Furthermore, a trip to the zoo can foster respect and appreciation for animals. Seeing and learning about animals firsthand can help people, especially city dwellers who may only interact with pets, develop a deeper understanding and appreciation for the importance of animals and the respect they deserve. Unfortunately, many people oppose zoos due to concerns about animal welfare and poor facilities in some zoos. While these concerns are valid, they do not undermine the fundamental purpose and benefits of zoos. Ideally, all zoos would provide perfect conditions for their animals, but even with some flaws, zoos remain a valuable resource.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"Firstly, serious movies often boast a diverse range of themes and content. In contrast to entertaining films, which are primarily designed to amuse audiences, serious movies tend to be more substantial and meaningful. Many entertaining movies, on the other hand, lack depth and are nonsensical. Serious films typically aim to convey profound thoughts on love, humanity, and social issues, highlighting the darker aspects of society.Secondly, not all serious movies are dull and unengaging. A case in point is ""Click"", a comedy with a serious undertone that explores the importance of striking a balance between work and family life. The film's humorous and satirical approach prompts viewers to reflect on their priorities and appreciate the value of family. The underlying messages in serious movies often transcend the visual and verbal elements, encouraging introspection and self-reflection.Furthermore, some serious movies encourage viewers to contemplate the harsh realities of the world. ""Blood Diamond"", a film based on true events in South Africa, exposes the connection between diamonds and conflict. Watching this movie can teach us a valuable lesson about the true cost of jewels and the association between diamonds and death. It challenges the common perception of diamonds as rare and symbolic of love, instead revealing a cruel reality. As a result, serious movies offer a unique perspective on the world, prompting us to think differently.For these reasons, I prefer watching serious movies that inspire deep thoughts and reflections about real life. They offer a more meaningful and impactful cinematic experience compared to entertaining films."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;"The media plays a crucial role in keeping the public informed about important events and issues. However, the primary goal of journalism should be to provide accurate and unbiased reporting, rather than relying on gossip and speculation. Unfortunately, the journalism landscape is shifting, with some reporters prioritizing sensational stories about celebrities' personal lives over substantive news about public issues.Firstly, gossip often involves manipulated or misleading information designed to boost sales or stir up public controversy. The audience is presented with a barrage of images and stories that appear to be newsworthy but are actually devoid of real substance. Moreover, this type of coverage can be a significant nuisance for the celebrities being reported on, as it invades their privacy and can be damaging to their reputation.Furthermore, the emphasis on sensational stories about famous people distracts from pressing social and public issues. Media executives face the challenge of selecting content that will engage their audience, often opting for frivolous or distorted stories about celebrities rather than meaningful news about education, the environment, or other significant public concerns. In essence, this type of ""yellow journalism"" blocks the audience from accessing important information and instead fills their attention with trivial or misleading content.In conclusion, based on the discussion above, I firmly believe that the media's excessive focus on the personal lives of famous people is a serious issue that needs to be addressed."
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;As a travel enthusiast, visiting an excellent museum is often the highlight of a trip to a new destination, and for good reason. There are several reasons why museums stand out as a must-visit attraction.Firstly, museums provide an easy and engaging way to learn about the history of a new place. For instance, my visit to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum in New York last year was incredibly enlightening. The exhibits revealed the significance of the Statue of Liberty as a symbol of freedom and Ellis Island as a gateway where immigrants brought their dreams and fears. Museums like this one offer a unique opportunity to understand the history and customs of a new location.Secondly, visiting a renowned museum can be a profoundly enriching experience, broadening our perspectives and inspiring us with its diverse and magnificent collections. The National Palace Museum in my city, for example, is famous for its ancient Chinese artifacts, including the astonishing Jadeite cabbage, crafted from jade. Such works of art are not only aesthetically pleasing but also thought-provoking.Furthermore, local museums are often a top choice for tourists, providing a valuable use of time that might otherwise be wasted on less fulfilling activities like shopping or staying in the hotel. Most importantly, these museums represent the unique culture of their location, allowing visitors to quickly acquaint themselves with the local customs and way of life.Given these reasons, visiting top museums around the world is an opportunity that should not be missed. During any trip, taking the time to visit a local museum is truly worthwhile, offering a depth and richness to the travel experience that is hard to find elsewhere.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";While studying from home using technology has its advantages, such as flexibility and convenience, it also has its drawbacks. The biggest benefit of online learning is that it provides 24/7 access to course materials and instructors, allowing students to create their own schedules and study at their own pace. However, this flexibility can be a double-edged sword, as it requires students to be highly self-motivated and possess excellent time management skills to stay on track.Firstly, online learning demands persistence and patience, as students are left to navigate course materials on their own without the direct guidance of an instructor. This can lead to difficulties in understanding certain topics or subjects, and without immediate support, students may struggle to overcome these challenges.Secondly, studying from home is vastly different from traditional learning. Unlike classroom-based education, online courses lack the structure and supervision that helps students stay focused. For those who are easily distracted, online learning may not be the best fit.Moreover, traditional schools offer a unique advantage: socialization. Interacting with classmates and teachers provides invaluable opportunities to develop essential life skills, such as cooperation, teamwork, and communication. While online programs can teach academic subjects, they cannot replace the social learning that occurs in a traditional classroom setting. For instance, teamwork and collaboration with peers are essential skills that are difficult to develop in isolation.In conclusion, based on these reasons, I strongly believe that distance education cannot replace traditional schools. The benefits of socialization, structure, and direct instructor support make traditional classrooms an indispensable part of the learning experience.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;I strongly believe that constructing a large shopping center in our community is a sound idea, and I'd like to outline the following reasons to support my stance.First and foremost, a large shopping center would provide residents with a more convenient and accessible shopping destination. A notable example is the Queens Center Mall in New York City's Queens borough, which boasts a diverse range of stores, products, and services, from apparel to electronics and dining options. This mall is renowned for its high productivity and offers an exhaustive list of brands, including Macy's and JCPenney. In my opinion, a large shopping mall serves as an ideal location for residents to spend their leisure time.Additionally, a shopping center not only offers a retail space but also generates job opportunities. The establishment of new stores within the mall would create a multitude of job vacancies, catering to individuals seeking part-time or full-time employment. This could be particularly beneficial for students and retirees looking to productively utilize their free time while earning a income.Lastly, a shopping center would enable residents to purchase goods at competitive prices while saving time. The emergence of a new shopping center would likely trigger competition among existing stores, prompting sales promotions and discounts. This would allow consumers to effortlessly compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions. Moreover, having a shopping center in close proximity to residential areas would eliminate the need for lengthy commutes, thereby conserving time and energy.In conclusion, based on these arguments, I firmly advocate for the construction of a large shopping center in my neighborhood, as it would yield numerous benefits for our community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";Many people view life as a constant struggle, filled with numerous challenges and difficulties. As a result, learning how to manage stress and cope with overwhelming pressure is an essential skill that we should all possess. Here are the reasons why.Stress is our body's natural response to any kind of demand, and it can be triggered by both positive and negative experiences. While stress can be a motivating force that drives us to succeed, it is often unexpected and frustrating, hindering our ability to achieve our goals. Without effective stress management skills, we may face serious problems.In today's fast-paced world, stress is a common issue that affects people of all ages, from young to old. Financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties, and work overload are just a few examples of the many stressors that can lead to depression. Some individuals see stress as a motivating force that helps them overcome obstacles, while others struggle to manage their thoughts, emotions, and problem-solving strategies. As a result, stress management has become an increasingly important concern.Moreover, stress can have severe consequences for our physical and mental health. Modern life is often filled with hassles, frustrations, and demands, leaving many people feeling overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to physical problems such as insomnia and headaches, as well as more severe issues like melancholia, which can even drive people to suicide. Therefore, it is crucial that we learn to reduce and cope with stress in order to maintain a healthy balance between our mind and body. To avoid becoming pessimistic, we can try to overcome our distress by sharing our worries with friends or family, engaging in regular exercise, and learning to view our troubles from a different perspective.In conclusion, I firmly believe that stress management is a vital skill that everyone should learn and master, finding their own unique way to manage and overcome stress.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Throughout our lives, it's unavoidable that we'll interact with various groups and organizations, making them an integral part of our existence. From my perspective, groups offer a platform for individuals to gain valuable experiences and achieve their goals. My reasoning is based on the following points:Firstly, humans are inherently social creatures, and society comprises a diverse range of groups. These groups play a vital role in the socialization process, from childhood to adulthood. We start participating in groups and organizations from a young age and often continue to do so throughout our lives. By working together, children in schools learn to interact with others, while university students join student organizations related to their majors to expand their experiences and network with peers. After graduating, employees may join business associations to access resources and benefits. As a result, most of us live and thrive in a group-oriented environment.Participating in an organization provides a positive means for individuals to acquire experiences and skills tailored to a specific purpose. A well-structured group can serve as an ideal environment, allowing people to improve themselves and broaden their horizons. For instance, as a mass media student, I joined a student group related to my major and gained hands-on experience in project management, while also learning about renowned artists in the field. This experience has significantly enhanced my resume, increasing my chances of securing a better job.Moreover, groups and organizations can motivate individuals to take action and achieve their objectives. Charitable organizations, such as Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhist organization in Taiwan, exemplify this point. Tzu Chi is renowned for its contributions to social and community services, as well as medical care, inspiring others with its selfless spirit. To accomplish their missions, charities rely on volunteers and sponsors to undertake challenging tasks, ultimately providing hope and support to those in need. By doing so, they create opportunities to make a positive impact on a global scale.In conclusion, based on the aforementioned reasons and examples, it's clear that groups and organizations are essential components of our lives, playing a vital role in various aspects, across different age groups and backgrounds.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;I would be delighted to learn that the government intends to establish a new university in my community. The advantages of setting up the university are numerous, including providing more opportunities for community members to pursue higher education and creating jobs. However, these benefits are accompanied by some drawbacks, such as potential social problems.The new university would offer a significant number of community members the chance to study locally. For instance, individuals living in remote areas with no nearby universities would no longer have to travel extensive distances to attend a business school. Instead, they could enroll in the proposed university's business school, eliminating the need to relocate or commute long distances.The establishment of the university would also generate employment opportunities, as it would need to hire professors, staff, and other personnel to fill various vacant positions. This, in turn, would create more job opportunities within the community. Furthermore, with a steady income, community members would have more disposable income to spend on goods and services, which could help stimulate the local economy.However, the construction of the university may lead to social issues. An influx of people from other communities may arrive in search of admission or employment opportunities at the university. When large crowds congregate in a single area, social problems often follow. Traffic congestion may worsen, waste management may become a concern, and crime rates may potentially increase. These social problems could negatively impact the overall quality of life in the community.In conclusion, I support the plan to build the university, as I believe the benefits will outweigh the costs. Nevertheless, it is essential for the government to conduct a survey to gauge community opinion on the new university before proceeding. This would help ensure that the community's needs and concerns are taken into account, ultimately leading to a more successful and sustainable university establishment.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The idea that the government should cover college tuition and expenses for all citizens who wish to attend college is a notion that some people support. However, I firmly believe that individuals should be responsible for paying their own college tuition. This stance is based on three key arguments: the prohibitively high cost of making college education free, the personal nature of the decision to attend college, and the availability of alternative funding options.Firstly, providing free college education would be excessively costly. It would necessitate diverting public funds away from other essential needs, such as law enforcement, infrastructure, and healthcare. There are numerous pressing needs that should take priority, including ensuring universal access to healthcare and improving public schools. Furthermore, making college education free would require repeated tax hikes, which would unfairly burden all taxpayers, regardless of whether they benefit from the allocation of funds.Secondly, attending college is a personal choice. Not everyone aspires to pursue higher education, and those who do so should be willing to make a financial investment in their own future. It is unreasonable to expect the government to foot the bill for an individual's decision to attend college, especially when it is a voluntary choice.Thirdly, there are numerous ways to fund a college education beyond relying on government subsidies. Students who cannot afford tuition can explore scholarship opportunities, financial aid, and other forms of assistance. Moreover, the government already contributes indirectly to college expenses by providing essential services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for schools and their students. Additionally, the government allocates funds for academic research, which, although not directly benefiting individual students, is a significant contribution nonetheless.In conclusion, individuals should be responsible for financing their own education, as it is a personal choice. Shifting this burden to taxpayers and the government would be unsustainable and unfair.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";We are all aware of the numerous benefits that television offers, including relaxation, staying informed about current events, and broadening our perspectives. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider the negative impact that television has on communication among friends and family. In my opinion, this is one of the most detrimental effects of television on our lives.Firstly, excessive television viewing can lead to social isolation. For instance, children often become so engrossed in TV shows and movies that they lose interest in other activities, such as attending school or engaging in physical exercise with their peers. As a result, they gradually drift apart from their friends, who move on with their lives, whether in academic or extracurricular pursuits.Secondly, the increasing prevalence of multiple TVs in each household, with each family member having their own set in their room, has contributed to a decline in communication among family members. Instead of interacting with one another, parents and children alike often prefer to watch TV in solitude. This can have severe consequences, as children may learn behaviors and values from TV shows rather than from their parents. Furthermore, parents may struggle to fulfill their parental responsibilities, leading to a visible deterioration in communication among family members.Lastly, watching excessive amounts of television can unconsciously instill harmful behaviors in individuals, which can sow discord among people. For example, exposure to films that glorify terrorism can lead children to consider such acts as justified. If children were to emulate the violent behaviors depicted in these films, it could contribute to social division and unrest.In conclusion, while television has its advantages, its detrimental impact on communication among friends and family cannot be overlooked. It is imperative that we address this issue promptly, with a primary focus on reducing the violent and inappropriate content that children are exposed to through television. By doing so, we can mitigate the harm caused by excessive TV viewing and foster healthier, more communicative relationships among family and friends.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience.

Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable.

Have you been to a stadium to cheer on your team, shouting and possibly even shedding tears alongside thousands of fellow fans? If you're passionate about football and your home team, being there in person to support them is far more exhilarating than watching the match alone at home.Firstly, attending a live football match is an incredibly rewarding experience. The pre-match atmosphere is electric, with thousands of fans gathering outside the stadium, waving team flags, wearing colorful outfits, and creating a deafening din with trumpets and rattles. As the game begins, the excitement inside the stadium reaches a fever pitch. You get to watch football stars in action with your own eyes, sharing the experience with a crowd of around 40,000 people - an exhilaration you simply can't replicate when watching at home. The collective energy is palpable, with everyone cheering and singing together, and the stadium erupts whenever a goal is scored.

While watching at home might be convenient, it's an experience that's easily forgotten, much like a movie. Although stadium tickets might be pricey, the entertainment value you get from the game far outweighs the cost. You can treasure the memory of the experience for a long time. Moreover, it can be an exclusive experience, particularly if it's a crucial win that clinches a trophy - you'll be right there to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, while watching football on television might be comfortable and enjoyable, watching a match live at the stadium is a far more thrilling experience. It can create moments that will stay with you forever, making it an experience that's hard to beat.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";While renewable energy sources are a crucial part of our current and future energy strategy, I believe they cannot replace fossil fuels like gas, oil, and coal anytime soon. One major obstacle is the high cost of renewable energy due to technological limitations. Research and development in this field are extremely expensive, making it unaffordable for many developing countries. In contrast, fossil fuels are abundant and relatively inexpensive in many areas. For instance, China has the world's largest coal reserves, and the government is hesitant to invest heavily in expensive alternatives like solar batteries and wind farms. This financial constraint may hinder the adoption of renewable energy sources, as not every country can afford the transition.Moreover, despite claims that renewable energy is environmentally friendly, it may not be as clean and green as we think. Recent studies have shown that these energy sources can also pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, hydroelectric dams disrupt river water flows, causing droughts and damaging habitats of valuable fish and bird species. Furthermore, the accumulation of heavy metals in the silt behind these dams is difficult and expensive to clean up, leaving problems for future generations. This raises questions about the reliability of renewable energy sources.Although fossil fuels currently cause significant environmental problems like acid rain, ozone layer depletion, and global warming, these issues can be mitigated by improving efficiency and reducing emissions. For example, using chemicals to desulfurize emissions from power plants and vehicles can help prevent acid rain. These solutions are often cheaper and simpler than the high-tech approaches required for renewable energy. As a result, fossil fuels seem like a more sustainable option.In conclusion, despite their promise, renewable energy sources are unlikely to replace fossil fuels in the near future.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;In recent times, a dominant viewpoint has emerged, suggesting that human requirements for farmland, housing, and industry take precedence over preserving land for endangered species. Those who disagree argue that reducing land for endangered animals would disrupt the ecological balance. However, I concur with the opinion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are of greater importance. My reasoning is based on the following aspects.Firstly, land allocated for farmland, housing, and industry benefits the society as a whole. It is undeniable that the economy of the entire society is developed through agriculture, real estate, and industry, particularly industry, which is a pillar of the national economy, as they generate substantial profits. Moreover, society becomes stable and harmonious due to the presence of more farmland and industry. It is widely recognized that increased farmland and industries provide more job opportunities, thereby decreasing unemployment and crime rates. Thus, the needs for farmland, housing, and industry are of paramount importance.Secondly, farmland, housing, and industry cater to humanity's desire for a better life. It is clear that farming, housing, and industry provide us with the essentials for living, such as food, shelter, and clothing. Especially in impoverished areas, survival is the most significant concern. Furthermore, advanced agriculture and industry can improve living conditions, enabling us to have a good quality of life.Lastly, I'd like to mention that even though farmland, housing, and industry may occupy land used for endangered animals, they can ultimately contribute to the protection of these species. As discussed earlier, agriculture and industry contribute to economic development. With economic growth, we can employ more advanced methods to care for endangered animals. For instance, we can invent new techniques to help endangered animals reproduce, ensuring their survival.In conclusion, while protecting endangered animals is necessary, human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are of greater importance. This prioritization is essential for the development and stability of society, as well as for improving the quality of human life, which in turn can facilitate better conservation efforts.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;While learning a foreign language in one's own country has its benefits, I strongly believe that immersing oneself in the language's native country provides a more comprehensive understanding of various language skills. In one's own country, a language learner, referred to as person 'A', can follow a structured teaching approach, which allows them to dedicate sufficient time and energy to learning the language. Moreover, learners from the same country are likely to learn the language in a similar manner. On the other hand, learning a language in its native country offers the opportunity to engage with native speakers. This enables learners to form friendships with locals and participate in groups composed of native speakers, ultimately leading to a deeper grasp of essential language skills. Additionally, they have access to the most current language usage, including idioms, proverbs, and other expressions that may not be available to person 'A'. If I had the means to travel, I would undoubtedly choose to learn a new language in its native country. The importance of communication in language acquisition is well-documented, and surrounding oneself with native speakers who expect communication in the target language creates an environment that fosters rapid and effective learning. In conclusion, although both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, I am convinced that the benefits of learning a language in its native country surpass those of learning it in one's own country.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";While some individuals argue that students should devote their entire day to academic pursuits, I firmly believe that physical exercise is an essential component of every school day. Exercise offers numerous benefits, not only for maintaining a healthy body but also for a healthy mind. Incorporating physical activity into a child's daily routine is a great way to instill the importance of exercise from a young age.Regular physical activity plays a significant role in promoting physical health in children. Given the rising rate of childhood obesity, engaging in daily physical activity can be highly beneficial, providing a much-needed break from prolonged periods of sitting in school. Furthermore, exercise can help minimize the risk of illnesses related to cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure, and cholesterol problems.Daily exercise also contributes to the development of children's brain function. It is well-established that regular exercise enhances the body's overall functioning. When individuals exercise, their respiratory system's efficiency is improved, allowing all organs, including the brain, to receive more oxygen. This, in turn, provides children with a mental break, boosting their ability to learn efficiently.Integrating physical activity into a child's daily routine from an early age teaches them the value of incorporating exercise into their daily schedule. Although children are often lectured about nutrition and physical activity, putting this knowledge into practice is more beneficial. By establishing a daily exercise routine, children are more likely to develop a lifelong habit of physical activity.In conclusion, incorporating physical activity into children's school day is an idea that should be strongly considered. It has the potential to improve not only mental and physical health but also to establish a habit of regular exercise, allowing children to appreciate the value of prioritizing physical activity in their daily lives.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In my opinion, it's not advisable for teenagers to have a job while they're still students. Although some argue that it provides valuable work experience, I believe it can have negative consequences on their life. Having a job can impact a student's health, distract them from their studies, and deprive them of their childhood.In today's competitive world, students need to dedicate a significant amount of time to their studies to achieve good grades. If they take on a job, it would add an extra burden, leading to stress, tension, and fatigue. Jobs come with responsibilities like attendance, extra work, and other commitments, which can leave students with little time for relaxation and sleep, ultimately affecting their mental and physical well-being.Another concern is that jobs can divert students' attention away from their studies. If students start earning money at a young age, they may become attracted to the financial gains and feel independent, leading them to prioritize work over studies. This can cause them to lose interest in their education and even drop out of school to pursue higher-paying opportunities.Furthermore, having a job as a teenager means missing out on the joys of childhood. They would have to sacrifice time spent with friends, participating in clubs and fun activities, and engaging in social interactions. While they have their entire life to work and prove themselves, childhood is a phase that can never be recaptured.Therefore, I firmly believe that teenagers should focus on their studies. Having a job can compromise their health, distract them from their academic pursuits, and rob them of a critical phase of their life. It's essential for them to make the most of their childhood and prioritize their education, as this is a time that will never come again.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;Visiting zoos has become a popular pastime for children, who often spend their free time exploring these facilities. Zoos have been a part of our global landscape for centuries, providing entertainment and fascination for people of all ages. However, over time, a debate has emerged about the role of zoos, with some arguing that they are beneficial to society, while others see them as inhumane treatment of animals.Proponents of zoos argue that they offer numerous benefits to humanity. Firstly, zoos are entertaining and provide a unique opportunity for people to connect with nature and wild animals, allowing them to escape the stresses of everyday life. Additionally, zoos serve as educational institutions, where students and researchers can observe and study the animal kingdom. Many zoos also function as conservation centers, providing a safe haven for endangered species.On the other hand, critics of zoos argue that these institutions deprive animals of their freedom and natural behavior. Confinement, they claim, can lead to stress, discomfort, and a loss of natural instincts. In their view, zoos are essentially prisons, and it is cruel and wrong to keep animals in such conditions.In my opinion, I side with the first group. In today's world, where natural habitats are being destroyed to make way for urban development, zoos have become increasingly important as spaces for people to learn about and appreciate nature. Furthermore, modern zoos are making efforts to create more naturalistic environments, providing proper care and nutrition for the animals, and ensuring their well-being. By doing so, zoos can continue to serve as valuable resources for education, conservation, and entertainment.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;If I could turn back time, I would retake all my exams after discovering the benefits of studying in a group with my classmates. Personally, I prefer group studying due to its notable advantages, including receiving help from peers, developing a positive attitude towards learning, and managing time effectively.When students form a study group, each member has an equal opportunity to assist one another. They can collaborate to comprehend complex aspects of a course. For instance, when a group encounters a challenging math problem, they can share their opinions to find a solution. Moreover, group studying has a remarkable impact, enabling all students to improve their weaknesses. Another benefit of group studying is the increase in motivation and competitive spirit. The most outstanding students in a group encourage their peers to study harder. Additionally, pupils often engage in a friendly competition, striving to achieve the highest grade within the group. This competition and encouragement clearly lead to better learning outcomes.When studying with friends, it is essential to have a schedule to utilize time efficiently. Group studying creates a sense of responsibility to manage time effectively, as we care about our peers and do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another significant advantage of group studying.In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group with my friends due to the numerous opportunities it provides. I can receive help from my peers, improve my learning skills, and manage my time effectively. Now, I am ready to move forward without regretting my past exams, and I am excited to start this new approach to learning.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Although friendship is a vital value in a person's life, individuals may have different preferences when it comes to their social circle. Some people prefer to spend time with a small, close-knit group of friends, while others enjoy being surrounded by a large number of acquaintances. Personally, I lean towards the latter.One of the primary reasons for this preference is that having a large number of friends provides ample opportunities to learn from their diverse experiences. For instance, within a large social circle, one may encounter someone who is an avid athlete, musician, or traveler, and their stories can inspire you to try something new that you may not have considered before. This exposure to various hobbies and interests can be incredibly enriching.While it's true that differences in opinion can sometimes lead to disagreements, making it challenging to reach a consensus, this is a trade-off I'm willing to make. In contrast, spending time with just one or two close friends often means that you share similar interests and preferences, reducing the likelihood of disagreements, but also limiting the diversity of viewpoints.Another significant advantage of having a large number of friends is that it can broaden your perspective and help you become more open-minded. When faced with a problem, seeking advice from a diverse group of friends can provide a wide range of solutions, as each person will approach the issue from their unique perspective. This can be incredibly valuable in making informed decisions, as you'll be able to consider multiple viewpoints and weigh the pros and cons more effectively.On the other hand, having just a few close friends can lead to more intimate relationships and a deeper sense of trust. However, the downside is that their viewpoints may not differ significantly from your own, which can limit the amount of new knowledge and experiences you gain from these relationships.In conclusion, while both options have their advantages and disadvantages, I firmly believe that having a large number of friends can greatly enhance one's life, offering a wider range of experiences, broader perspectives, and a more dynamic social environment.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The development of public transportation is crucial for a developed society. It plays a vital role in conserving natural resources, reducing air pollution, and fostering a sense of community. Therefore, I firmly believe that governments should allocate more funds to improve and expand public transportation systems.One of the primary benefits of using public transportation is the conservation of natural resources. Private cars rely heavily on oil and gasoline, which are non-renewable resources that will eventually run out. In contrast, public transportation options like buses, trains, and subways can transport a large number of people while using significantly less fuel per person. This makes public transportation an essential tool in reducing our reliance on finite resources.Another significant advantage of public transportation is its role in reducing air pollution. Private cars emit harmful gases like carbon dioxide, which contribute to pollution and climate change. The more cars on the road, the more pollution is released into the atmosphere. By using public transportation, we can decrease the number of cars on the road, resulting in lower emissions and a healthier environment.Public transportation also promotes social interaction and a sense of community. When we drive private cars, we often travel alone or with family members, missing out on opportunities to meet new people and connect with others. In contrast, public transportation provides a shared experience, allowing us to interact with a diverse range of people and fostering a sense of belonging to the community.In conclusion, public transportation offers numerous benefits for modern society, including environmental conservation, reduced pollution, and increased social interaction. Given the many challenges faced by modern societies, such as environmental degradation, social isolation, and resource depletion, it is imperative that governments invest more in public transportation and encourage its use. By doing so, we can create a more sustainable, connected, and healthy community for all.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate about the role of zoos in animal welfare has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that zoos are beneficial for animals, others believe that these creatures are inferior and do not warrant our concern. In my view, it is crucial that we prioritize the well-being and safety of animals in their natural habitats.Numerous scientific studies have exposed the harm caused by zoos to animals. For instance, animals, like humans, are born with inherent genetic instincts that enable them to thrive in their native environments. However, when animals are captured and placed in unfamiliar surroundings, they begin to lose these essential instincts. As a result, when they are released or escape, they become disoriented, leading to increased mortality rates.Furthermore, many zoos lack the necessary resources and policies to ensure adequate animal care. A personal experience that stands out in my mind is my first visit to a zoo at the age of eight. I was dismayed by the cruel treatment of animals by the staff. None of the staff members displayed proper behavior towards the animals, often resorting to physical abuse when the animals refused to eat, and justifying their actions as a training method.In conclusion, I firmly believe that we must prioritize animal welfare and provide them with the highest quality of life possible. The scientific evidence highlights the potential harm inflicted by zoos on animals, and many zoos fall short of meeting the required standards of care. It is our responsibility to ensure that animals are treated with respect and protected in their natural environments, rather than being subjected to the hardships of captivity.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;Most universities worldwide strive to conduct research in various countries, often focusing on fields like business or agriculture. If a university were to establish a new research center in my country, I would choose to prioritize a center for agricultural research over one for business research.First and foremost, my country boasts an abundance of untapped land suitable for agricultural purposes. By establishing a research center focused on agriculture, we can empower our citizens to optimize the use of this land and address issues related to land management, particularly for those lacking knowledge or education in this area.Furthermore, an agricultural research center would significantly contribute to the economic growth of my country. Currently, the agricultural sector accounts for only 30% of the market share. The research center could enhance this market share by developing agricultural products, such as dates, which are a staple crop in my country. Researchers could investigate ways to improve the quality of dates, palm tree care, and land treatment, ultimately boosting the agricultural industry.Another compelling reason to prioritize an agricultural research center is its potential to create numerous job opportunities. By teaching people how to effectively utilize their land and produce high-quality agricultural products, we can encourage them to pursue careers in agriculture rather than other fields. This, in turn, can lead to increased employment and economic stability.While some argue that a business research center is more crucial for keeping pace with advanced countries that have focused on business, I firmly believe that being a developed country is not solely dependent on prioritizing business. Instead, we should focus on areas that bring us self-sufficiency and satisfaction. For my country, agriculture is the key sector that can achieve this goal.In conclusion, my country should focus on establishing research centers in agriculture, which would have far-reaching, positive consequences for agricultural workers, the economy, and employment rates. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of our land, improve our economic standing, and create a more sustainable and satisfying future for our citizens.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;Throughout their lives, people have a vast array of subjects to learn and master. To achieve this, they employ various methods to expand their knowledge and skills. One approach that I highly recommend is hands-on learning, where individuals learn by doing things themselves, rather than relying solely on reading or listening to others. This method is particularly effective for those who are serious about acquiring new skills or knowledge.First and foremost, learning by doing fosters maturity and self-reliance. When individuals take the initiative to learn through hands-on experience, they become more independent and less reliant on external sources of information, such as books or other people. This approach allows them to gain valuable experiences that help build their maturity. For instance, someone who aspires to become a leader must immerse themselves in real-world situations, such as leading a team or group, in order to develop the necessary skills. Simply reading about leadership or listening to others discuss it is insufficient.Moreover, hands-on learning is often more engaging and exciting than traditional methods. Many life skills can only be truly learned through direct experience. Reading about a subject or listening to someone else's account of it can rarely replicate the same level of excitement or sensation as actually doing it oneself. For example, people who want to learn how to swim must get in the water and experience it firsthand, rather than just reading about it or listening to someone describe the process.Another significant advantage of hands-on learning is that it tends to be more motivating than other methods. Over time, reading about a subject or listening to someone talk about it can become tedious and boring. In contrast, hands-on learning provides a sense of accomplishment and pleasure, especially when one succeeds in mastering a new skill. This, in turn, motivates individuals to continue learning and exploring new subjects through hands-on experience.History has consistently shown that hands-on learning is one of the most effective ways to acquire new knowledge and skills. Rather than relying solely on reading or listening to others, people should be encouraged to try new things and persist in their efforts until they achieve their learning goals. By doing so, they will not only gain valuable knowledge and skills but also develop the maturity, motivation, and self-reliance necessary to succeed in their endeavors.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;In recent years, many airlines have been offering an increasing number of affordable flights to their customers. The trend of cheap air travel has sparked a range of opinions among people. While there are valid arguments in favor of promoting this trend, I personally believe that cheap flights pose significant problems.It is undeniable that low-cost air fares have expanded travel opportunities for many individuals, particularly those with lower incomes. Nowadays, millions of people can travel worldwide for business or leisure, developing their careers, broadening their knowledge, and interacting with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Furthermore, travel helps promote the development of the tourism industry, boosting the economies and job markets of numerous countries.However, the growth of cheap flights has a detrimental impact on the environment. The increased number of flights leads to larger and busier airports, which can exacerbate air pollution for those living and working nearby. Moreover, the major concern is the effect on global warming. The combustion of plane fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing the Earth to heat up. Notably, while efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, little is being done to regulate the airlines' emissions.In conclusion, I argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. Nevertheless, this does not imply that air travel should become more expensive. Rather, individuals should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions resulting from their lifestyle choices. 
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The question of how governments should allocate their transportation budgets has sparked a debate. While some argue that funds should be spent on upgrading roads and highways, others believe that investing in public transportation is the way to go. In my view, governments should prioritize spending on public transportation systems, as this would help mitigate the problems caused by the increasing number of private vehicles on the road.Firstly, using public transportation conserves resources. Since cars rely on gasoline, a non-renewable resource, the more cars on the road, the faster we deplete our gasoline reserves. In contrast, efficient public transportation systems significantly reduce the amount of gasoline consumed per person, thereby helping to preserve this valuable natural resource.Secondly, public transportation can help alleviate air pollution. On average, public transport vehicles use less gasoline to transport people than private cars, resulting in lower gas emissions and a reduction in air pollution. This, in turn, improves the overall air quality, making it safer for people to breathe.Lastly, public transportation is considerably safer than private transportation. According to the National Safety Council, traveling by bus is over 170 times safer than driving a private car. Given these benefits, it is only logical that governments should invest in public transportation, a mode of transport that is not only environmentally friendly and economical but also safe.In conclusion, I firmly believe that investing in public transportation is essential, as it holds the key to protecting our environment, ensuring a healthy and safe living space for everyone.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;Each person has their own unique approach to achieving success in life. In an academic setting, success is largely dependent on one's study habits. While some students thrive in group study settings, I personally prefer studying individually as it enables me to concentrate better and develop my personality.Studying alone allows for greater focus on lessons. For instance, I am someone who needs solitude to fully comprehend subjects. This method enables me to create and follow my own study schedules, guidelines, and exercises without distractions. Furthermore, certain subjects like mathematics, reading, and drawing often require solo study sessions. In my view, studying alone permits me to utilize every moment efficiently without wasting time.Moreover, studying alone contributes to building one's personality. For example, completing homework independently fosters responsibility and independence. It also motivates individuals to strive for accuracy in their work, setting them up for future success. On a personal note, adhering to a study plan and meeting deadlines enhances my precision and carefulness over time.In conclusion, there are multiple study methods, and it is an individual's prerogative to choose the approach that best suits their character, whether that be alone or in a group. I concur with the notion of solo studying as it improves my focus and helps establish my personality. Ultimately, success demands hard work and sacrifice, regardless of whether one chooses to study alone or in a group.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";"The impact of human activity on the Earth is a topic of ongoing debate, with some arguing that it has a positive influence. However, I firmly believe that human actions are detrimental to our planet. The evidence suggests that human behavior is causing significant harm to the environment, depleting natural resources, and threatening the survival of other species.Human activities are contaminating the ecosystem. Over the past few decades, as consumption has increased, so too has the amount of waste generated. The sheer volume of household and industrial waste has become so massive that it is forming a ""new"" continent in the ocean, composed entirely of garbage. Furthermore, the emission of industrial gases is polluting the air, leading to unhealthy phenomena such as acid rain, global warming, and climate change.In addition to environmental degradation, humans are also depleting the Earth's natural resources. Resources like oil and coal are essential for human activity, and as a result, their exploitation has increased dramatically to meet the infinite demands of human consumption. Researchers have warned that most natural resources are non-renewable, and that within a few decades, the Earth's resources will be completely exhausted. At that point, human activity will be severely impacted due to its dependence on these resources.Moreover, human actions are endangering the lives of other species. Hunting has been a fundamental human activity for obtaining food, and over millions of years, particularly in recent centuries with the advent of rifles and dynamite, humans have killed vast numbers of animals, driving some species to extinction. Additionally, due to population pressure, humans are expanding their living spaces, resulting in the contraction of habitats for other species. This reduction in living space is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.In conclusion, based on the discussed reasons, it is clear that human activity is gradually destroying the Earth by polluting the environment, depleting resources, and imperiling the lives of other species. The cumulative effect of these actions is causing irreparable harm to our planet, and it is essential that we take immediate action to mitigate these effects and ensure a sustainable future."
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";If given the chance to influence a company's decision on allocating funds to either support the arts or environmental conservation, I would unequivocally choose the latter. My reasoning is based on several key points.Firstly, environmental conservation has never been more critical than it is today. A striking statistic from the International Animal Preserving Association reveals that only 10% of all animal species that have ever existed still remain, underscoring the grave threat to biodiversity. Furthermore, the rise in sea levels due to global warming has reached alarming heights, posing significant threats to human life in numerous countries. The continued emission of carbon dioxide, largely due to non-environmentally friendly vehicles, could lead to catastrophic consequences, including the submersion of nations like Japan, drastic changes in weather patterns, and an increase in devastating storms. The current state of our ecosystem is dire, and immediate, drastic measures are necessary to prevent irreversible damage.Additionally, investing in environmental protection can yield long-term benefits for the company. With the growing awareness and concern for conservation among the public, sponsoring environmental projects has become a highly effective advertising strategy. Imagine the positive brand image and goodwill that your company would garner by successfully supporting a project that improves the environment. In today's consumer-oriented society, being recognized as an environmentally friendly company can have significant marketing advantages.Lastly, conservation efforts contribute to a higher standard of living. While art is undoubtedly a valuable form of entertainment and expression, a polluted environment undermines our ability to fully appreciate and engage with it. The beauty of nature and biodiversity are not only outcomes of environmental conservation but also essential inspirations and subjects for various forms of art, including photography.In conclusion, although supporting the arts may offer short-term benefits for both humanity and the company, I firmly believe that prioritizing environmental protection serves the best long-term interest. The urgency and importance of addressing our current environmental challenges, coupled with the potential for positive brand recognition and the intrinsic value of conservation for human well-being and artistic expression, make environmental conservation the clear choice.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In a professional setting, interacting with individuals from diverse backgrounds is inevitable, and fostering positive relationships with them is crucial for a harmonious work environment. Among these relationships, the one with your coworker is paramount, as they are the person you collaborate with closely and often rely on. In my opinion, a good coworker should possess three essential characteristics: cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.Firstly, coworkers should be cooperative with each other. Lack of cooperation can lead to numerous disputes and a dysfunctional work environment. I recall a experience with a coworker who prioritized their family commitments over work responsibilities, often leaving the office promptly without ensuring tasks were completed. I frequently had to compensate for their lack of dedication to avoid drawing the attention of our authoritative supervisor. However, when I needed to leave early to attend to a family matter, my coworker refused to assist me, citing a frivolous excuse. This incident led me to reevaluate our working relationship, and ultimately, their lack of cooperation resulted in their transfer to a different department.Secondly, trust among coworkers is vital. Suspicion and distrust can be detrimental to a positive work environment. I encountered a situation where a subordinate suspected a coworker of reporting negatively about them to me. Although the suspicion had some merit, as the coworker had attempted to highlight the subordinate's shortcomings, I do not condone tale-carrying and the coworker eventually ceased their negative reporting. Nevertheless, the mistrust persisted, creating an unpleasant atmosphere in our department.Lastly, fellowship among coworkers is essential. It enables them to enjoy their work life while building strong personal relationships. Considering the significant amount of time spent at the office, having good company can be a blessing. In conclusion, cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship are the cornerstone of a positive and productive working relationship, and their absence can have devastating consequences for the work environment.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;The concept of luck has led many individuals to achieve things they never thought possible. Nevertheless, I fail to see the logic in relying solely on luck to attain one's objectives. Consequently, I strongly endorse the notion that hard work, rather than luck, is the key to reaching one's goals.Firstly, relying exclusively on luck for accomplishments is a risky endeavor. Luck is an intangible and unpredictable entity that may never materialize. The disappointment that follows when luck does not prevail can be overwhelming. In contrast, striving diligently towards one's goals ensures that hard work, at the very least, brings one closer to their desired outcome. My personal experience serves as a testament to this, as all my accomplishments have been the direct result of my hard work, not luck. I have never encountered the disappointment of falling short of my goals.Secondly, believing in the importance of hard work fosters a visionary mindset. Individuals who prioritize hard work are typically clear about their objectives and are well-versed in the process required to achieve them. They meticulously organize their approach, continually assess their progress, and persist until they reach their target. Conversely, those who rely on luck often lack direction and clarity regarding their goals. For instance, a friend of mine, plagued by financial constraints, had a penchant for purchasing lottery tickets, hoping to win and alleviate his financial woes. However, his luck has yet to manifest, and his problems have only intensified.Thirdly, dedication and hard work can actually attract luck, propelling one even further towards their goals. My boss, for example, worked tirelessly towards his promotion, scrutinizing every aspect necessary to outperform his competitors. He recognized the value of a master's degree in enhancing his credentials and, despite numerous commitments, successfully completed the degree before applying for the promotion. Ultimately, not only did he secure the promotion amidst fierce competition, but he was also nominated for a foreign scholarship, as his credentials surpassed those of his peers.Although being lucky can be beneficial, relying solely on luck is not a viable strategy. Therefore, I firmly believe in the power of hard work, which is less likely to lead to disappointment compared to luck. Hard work provides a sense of control and agency over one's achievements, making it a more reliable and fulfilling approach to reaching one's goals.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;In this digital age, online classes have gained significant interest and become increasingly common in society. Nearly every school has developed its own online class system, raising the question of whether online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning. Although online classes have numerous advantages, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.Firstly, interaction with others, such as classmates and professors, remains a crucial aspect of studying. Group work fosters discussion and the exchange of opinions among students, leading to expanded perspectives and respect for others' ideas. In contrast, distance learning provides limited opportunities for discussion and interaction with peers.Secondly, traditional classroom learning offers a range of activities beyond studying. During free time, students can engage in various activities, such as playing sports, working in labs, or visiting the library, which promotes social interaction and friendship. These connections can enhance cognitive abilities and provide opportunities to learn about society. In contrast, online courses often confine students to their homes, limiting their social interactions.Lastly, traditional schools provide professors who guide and support students when they encounter problems or need advice. Professors are readily available to offer guidance and assistance, and they prioritize helping students. In contrast, distance learning reduces the importance of these aspects, with professors primarily focused on teaching and often slow to respond to student inquiries.In conclusion, traditional learning still offers numerous benefits to students. However, it appears that distance learning may become increasingly popular and prevalent in schools in the future. Despite this trend, I believe that traditional learning classes provide unique advantages that online classes cannot replicate, making them a valuable and preferable option for students.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The debate about whether university students should be required to attend classes is a pressing issue that affects a vast number of students globally. Despite varying policies on this matter, a crucial consideration is whether the goal is to maximize the acquisition of knowledge or the accumulation of valuable experiences for students. In my opinion, the freedom to choose not to attend classes is essential, as it enhances the overall quality of student life, boosts learning motivation, and fosters important life skills.Firstly, a liberal attendance policy is highly practical. Monitoring attendance is a bureaucratic burden, particularly in large classes where it is nearly impossible to track every student's attendance. Allowing optional attendance saves time and resources.Secondly, some students may learn more effectively through self-study, such as reading textbooks, especially if the lecturer is uninspiring. By giving students the autonomy to miss classes, they can avoid poor teaching and optimize their study time. This enables them to delve into the course material independently and make the most of their study time.Moreover, the freedom to skip classes promotes flexibility, which in turn enhances the quality of student life. Sometimes, personal or social commitments, like a Thursday night event, may conflict with Friday morning lectures. A liberal policy enables students to postpone their studying to a more convenient time, giving them a sense of freedom and improving their time management. Research has shown that student satisfaction with their lifestyle is directly linked to their academic performance.Lastly, psychology distinguishes between two types of motivation: intrinsic, which stems from personal interest, and extrinsic, which is driven by external praise. Intrinsic motivation is more desirable, as it leads to better learning outcomes and overall well-being. However, to develop intrinsic motivation, students need to discover their strengths and goals. By granting students the freedom to choose their attendance, they are more likely to reflect on their reasons for studying and develop self-motivation skills. These skills are essential for their academic success and lifelong personal growth.In conclusion, it is evident that attending classes should be optional for university students. I firmly believe this, given the benefits to students' current experience and the valuable skills and knowledge they acquire for their future. By adopting a liberal attendance policy, universities can promote student autonomy, flexibility, and intrinsic motivation, ultimately leading to better academic outcomes and enhanced overall well-being.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;The place where we live has a profound impact on our lives, and its selection should be based on various factors. While some individuals prefer residing in tall buildings and crowded areas, others opt for a quieter, smaller town. Personally, I would choose to live in a small town, as I believe it offers several advantages, including pleasant weather, a healthier lifestyle, and better amenities.Firstly, one of the primary benefits of living in a small town is the opportunity to lead a healthier life. This is attributed to several factors, including favorable weather conditions and a lower population density. Small towns are also characterized by less crowding and traffic congestion, resulting in reduced pollution, such as air and noise pollution. This, in turn, contributes to a life with less stress and greater happiness. Moreover, the food and materials available in small towns are generally fresher and healthier than those found in large cities, with an abundance of fresh produce and fruits. With few exceptions, it is clear that residing in small towns is healthier than living in metropolitan areas.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is the lower cost of living. Living expenses are a significant concern in every society, and small towns offer a more affordable lifestyle compared to big cities. As a result, it is possible to reside in spacious homes with attractive landscapes, and the less crowded environment provides more facilities and services. Transportation costs are also lower in small towns, with less traffic, allowing for valuable time and money savings.In conclusion, my preference is to live in a small town, which I believe offers numerous advantages, including reduced stress due to better weather conditions and stronger community relationships. In small towns, residents are more likely to know and interact with each other, fostering a sense of community and cooperation that is often lacking in larger cities, where individuals may feel isolated and more prone to depression. Ultimately, it is evident that people living in small towns tend to experience greater happiness and friendship, and fewer instances of illness and stress.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;In recent years, a growing number of young people from rural areas have been migrating to cities in pursuit of employment and educational opportunities. In this essay, I will discuss the drawbacks of this trend, as well as the underlying reasons behind it.The primary motivation for young adults to migrate to cities is the prospect of better-paying jobs and greater educational opportunities compared to what is available in rural areas. Cities are often home to large companies and universities, making them attractive destinations for those seeking to advance their careers. As a result, many young people move to cities to pursue academic and professional goals, with the aim of improving their standard of living. For instance, a graduate who remains in the city after completing their studies and secures a well-paying job may be able to afford a house or car within a relatively short period.However, this phenomenon also has several negative consequences. The influx of young people from rural areas to cities inevitably leads to overpopulation, resulting in inadequate living space and poor housing conditions. Furthermore, this can put a strain on the environment, as the increased number of people in cities leads to a higher volume of vehicles on the roads, causing air pollution.In conclusion, while cities offer numerous educational and career opportunities that attract young people, I believe that this trend has significant drawbacks. The negative effects on the quality of life and the environment are notable concerns that cannot be ignored. Ultimately, I do not support this trend due to its detrimental consequences.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;In today's society, economics plays a vital role, making it essential for students to gain a solid understanding of its principles. The sooner students are introduced to this field, the more proficient they will become. Therefore, in my opinion, high school students should be required to take a basic economics course, despite the time commitment it may require. Let me elaborate on this point.Firstly, a basic economics class can provide students with a sense of direction in their academic pursuits. By introducing them to the fundamentals of economics, students can develop an understanding of the subject matter and cultivate their own interest in the field. This, in turn, can foster a sense of career orientation, motivating students to work harder towards achieving their economic goals.Moreover, economics is closely tied to politics, allowing students to explore specialized knowledge alongside political concepts. This can broaden their perspective on national issues, encouraging them to think beyond the confines of their textbooks. Additionally, the inherent connection between economics and enterprise can provide students with practical and engaging knowledge.Furthermore, a basic economics course can also benefit students when they transition to college. With a foundational understanding of economics, they will be better equipped to learn and absorb new knowledge, saving time and enabling them to study more efficiently and in-depth than their peers. This, in turn, can boost their confidence and make them more competitive.Considering these factors, I firmly believe that a basic economics course is essential for high school students. It can provide them with a strong foundation, practical knowledge, and a competitive edge, ultimately preparing them for success in their academic and professional pursuits.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;University is a gateway to life, providing individuals with a foundation of wisdom and virtue that enables them to succeed. The significance of university raises an important question: do only students with exceptional academic performance deserve to attend university, or should it be accessible to any young person with aspirations? To answer this, it's essential to consider both perspectives before reaching a conclusion.On one hand, students who excel academically are naturally suited for university due to their intellectual capabilities. They can easily grasp complex information, which may be overwhelming for those with lesser skills. Furthermore, it's only fair that individuals reap the rewards of their hard work and dedication. University can be seen as a reward for those who have put in the effort to achieve academic excellence.On the other hand, university is not solely focused on academic pursuits, but also serves as a platform for nurturing artistic talent and developing essential life skills. Therefore, it should be accessible to a broad range of young people who wish to pursue their passions and develop holistically. By doing so, individuals can explore their interests, develop their skills, and become well-rounded individuals.Moreover, restricting university access to only the most academically gifted students could have negative social consequences. Those who are denied access may become disheartened, and those who lack necessary preparation may struggle to secure employment, particularly in white-collar jobs. This could lead to an increase in social problems and unemployment.In conclusion, the idea of restricting university access has both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, the negative consequences outweigh the positive ones. Therefore, university education should be made available to a diverse range of learners, providing them with the opportunity to grow, develop, and succeed in their chosen paths.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In the modern era, the notion of a welfare state obliges governments to ensure their citizens have access to comprehensive healthcare and health education. I firmly endorse the proposition that governments should allocate a larger share of their health budgets to health education and preventive measures.The primary rationale for prioritizing education and prevention is the potential for significant enhancements in the healthcare system. By reducing the number of patients, healthcare facilities can be managed more efficiently, ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes for existing patients. To achieve this, it is essential to educate society about health issues, enabling individuals to take preventive measures against illnesses rather than relying on treatment for an increasing number of patients.A secondary justification for governments to dedicate more resources to illness prevention and health education is the overall welfare of society. In my view, health is the most vital aspect of human life, as it is a precursor to happiness and well-being. Consequently, a government's responsibility should include providing the means for citizens to learn how to prevent potential illnesses that can cause suffering. For instance, the Turkish Ministry of Health's marketing campaign targeting smoking among youth led to improved well-being among those who quit smoking and adopted healthier lifestyles following the campaign.In conclusion, a larger proportion of the budget should be assigned to education and prevention compared to treatment, as this approach can yield a more effective healthcare system and a higher level of societal well-being.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"In recent years, students have experienced increasing levels of stress due to the rising number of academic tasks assigned by teachers aimed at boosting academic achievement. Although some argue that non-academic subjects should be eliminated entirely, I firmly disagree.Firstly, from a health perspective, schools should offer more than just academic subjects. Removing physical education from the curriculum would have significant negative consequences on students' well-being. For example, after a morning of studying and sitting in class, participating in outdoor activities like stretching, jogging, and playing team sports can enhance students' learning capacity in afternoon classes. Eliminating physical education would not only harm students' health but also diminish their ability to learn.Furthermore, schools play a crucial role in developing students into well-rounded individuals. Achieving success in life is more important than mere academic success. To succeed in life, students need more than just academic knowledge; they require practical life skills like cooking, effective communication, and teamwork. Therefore, school education should focus on teaching students how to be independent and lead a fulfilling life, rather than solely concentrating on academic development.Some may argue that students can acquire practical skills from their parents outside of school hours. However, I believe this is not a viable solution, as many young people would rather engage in leisure activities like watching TV or playing video games instead of learning from their parents. Additionally, parents are often too preoccupied with their jobs to dedicate time to teaching their children essential life skills.In conclusion, I firmly believe that non-academic subjects are just as vital as academic ones for a student's overall development. Consequently, schools should not consider removing these subjects from their curriculum."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals relocate to a new country, they are often faced with the decision of whether to adopt the customs of their new home or retain their original ones. Some choose to assimilate into the new culture by following local customs, while others prefer to maintain their traditional ways, finding it challenging to adapt to new practices. Personally, I would opt to follow the new customs if I were to migrate to another country.On the one hand, embracing new customs can facilitate a smoother transition into the new country. Immigrants often experience culture shock due to the differences between their native culture and the new one. Adapting to local customs is an effective way to learn about and understand the new culture. For instance, participating in a Buddhist ceremony in India, such as observing a traditional Buddhist sutra on Buddha's Birthday, can provide valuable insights into Indian religion and culture. By doing so, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the culture, which in turn, aids in their adaptation to the new country.On the other hand, insisting on maintaining one's original customs can lead to discrimination. When people cling to their traditional practices and resist adopting new ones, they may be perceived as a distinct group within the new society. Locals may also view them as separate from the mainstream community. A notable example is the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969, who established their own community, Chinatown, and preserved their language and customs. While the locals would stop working at 4:00 pm to rest, the Chinese immigrants continued to work, leading to resentment from the locals who felt jealous of the immigrants' wealth. This ultimately resulted in the locals targeting the Chinese community. If the Chinese immigrants had adopted local customs and assimilated into Indonesian society, they might have avoided being viewed as outsiders and faced less discrimination.In conclusion, immigrants should adopt the customs of their new country, as this can help them overcome culture shock more quickly and integrate into the new culture. By doing so, they can foster a more harmonious relationship with the local community and build a more successful life in their new home.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;"In today's interconnected world, collaboration has become essential for achieving success. As a result, working in a team is a vital skill that every individual should possess. However, I firmly believe that the ability to work independently is even more crucial.While effective teamwork can simplify and accelerate tasks, there are many instances where working alone is unavoidable. For example, numerous tests and exams prohibit collaboration, making individual work a necessary skill. Consider a student who excels in group discussions but lacks experience working independently; standardized tests like the SAT or TOEFL can be daunting. Given the importance of testing in various aspects of life, and the prevalence of individual assessments, it is essential to develop the ability to work alone to achieve outstanding results, such as gaining college admission or excelling in school finals.Moreover, developing the ability to work independently can actually enhance one's teamwork skills. Effective teamwork requires each member to bring their own ideas to the table, which are then discussed and refined with the team. Since our brains are separate entities, individual thinking is still a fundamental aspect of teamwork. When team members can generate their own ideas, collaboration becomes more productive and efficient.In conclusion, both teamwork and independent work are essential skills for a successful life. Although teamwork is vital, the ability to work alone lays the foundation for effective collaboration and plays a significant role in many situations. Ultimately, mastering both skills is necessary to achieve brilliance in various aspects of life."
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;Smoking can be a source of enjoyment and relief for some individuals. However, the risks it poses to others' health far outweigh any personal benefits, making it imperative to restrict smoking in public areas, including restaurants. I strongly advocate for the prohibition of smoking in restaurants and other public places, and support state laws that ban it, as it not only degrades the environment but also poses a significant health threat to others.Firstly, while it may seem extreme to suggest a complete ban on smoking in society, smoking in restaurants is particularly problematic as it disregards the health of others. Second-hand smoke, which emanates from the smoker, is generally considered more harmful to bystanders than to the smoker themselves. For instance, even if only one person is smoking in a restaurant, all others present are involuntarily exposed to smoke, putting their health at risk. This is because the substances released from burning cigarettes can easily compromise a person's respiratory system upon inhalation. Thus, smoking in restaurants must be strictly prohibited to prevent these public spaces from becoming health hazards for all patrons.Moreover, even those not immediately concerned about the health risks of second-hand smoke often find it ruins their dining experience. The smoke exhaled by smokers can make others feel uncomfortable or disgusted, affecting their mood and appetite. This, in turn, can indirectly lead to a decline in the restaurant's popularity, as fewer people are inclined to dine there due to these unpleasant experiences.Lastly, smoking offers no benefits to the smoker either. It not only exacerbates their health, making them more susceptible to respiratory diseases, but also tarnishes their public image and reputation. This is especially pertinent for public figures or celebrities, as smoking in restaurants is often viewed as impolite and uncivil. The public may then perceive the smoker as lacking basic civility, which could undermine their credibility as a public leader.In conclusion, smoking in restaurants is harmful and disrespectful behavior. It jeopardizes the health of others and damages the smoker's reputation. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in restaurants and other public places, and state laws should be enacted to strictly prohibit it, ensuring a healthier and more considerate environment for all.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";"The question of whether people should engage in hobbies and physical activities outside of work has been a topic of debate. Opinions on the matter vary, with some individuals believing that focusing solely on one's job is the priority. However, I disagree with this perspective. Engaging in personal hobbies and physical activities can have numerous benefits.Firstly, participating in hobbies and sports is an effective way to maintain physical fitness. Prolonged periods of sitting in front of a computer screen can lead to health issues such as obesity and vision problems. For instance, my neighbor Tom, a former computer engineer, used to have an inactive lifestyle, relying on fast food and never exercising. After realizing the negative impact on his health and personal life, he decided to make a change. He started jogging every morning and, within a month, noticed significant improvements in his weight and overall well-being, even finding a girlfriend.Additionally, dedicating long periods to a single activity can become monotonous, and engaging in hobbies and sports can serve as a mental refreshment. For example, schools incorporate breaks between classes to allow students to rest and prepare for the next session. Unlike machines, humans have limitations and cannot operate continuously without rest. Engaging in hobbies or sports, even if for a short duration, can rejuvenate our energy levels.Lastly, developing a personal hobby can provide an outlet for emotional expression, especially during times of depression or stress. Playing a musical instrument, such as the classical guitar, which I play, can be particularly therapeutic. When faced with academic challenges, playing songs like ""Green Sleeves"" helps alleviate my stress and boosts my confidence.Although developing personal hobbies may require a significant investment of time, the rewards are substantial, including a healthier body, a refreshed mind, and a means to cope with pressure and sadness. Therefore, I firmly believe that engaging in hobbies and physical activities outside of work is beneficial and should be encouraged."
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The rapid growth of the population has led to an increased demand for transportation, resulting in numerous problems that many countries have been struggling with for a long time, including pollution, noise, and accidents. From my point of view, the most effective solution to these issues is to improve roads and highways, and I believe there are three key reasons for this.Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge that expanding public transportation can exacerbate pollution and accidents. The emissions from buses, cars, and trains release harmful gases that contribute to serious health problems, such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Furthermore, the noise from engines can also lead to hearing impairment. Most critically, the number of accidents on roads is alarming. For instance, in my country, Vietnam, buses are a significant contributor to the high accident rate, with approximately 12,000 fatalities annually, which is comparable to the death toll of the Japanese tsunami.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can increase their capacity, allowing for a smoother flow of both public and private vehicles. This can greatly reduce congestion and the likelihood of accidents. For example, during peak hours when everyone is rushing to go home, the roads become extremely crowded, making it difficult to commute. However, if the roads were widened, travel times would be significantly reduced, and the incidence of collisions would decrease substantially.Lastly, spending on the renovation of highways and roads can lead to a notable improvement in their quality. The condition of roads with numerous potholes is not only uncomfortable but also dangerous, leading to accidents and anxiety among travelers. It is unfair to solely blame drivers for accidents when part of the responsibility lies with the authorities for maintaining road conditions. A smooth road surface, on the other hand, enhances safety and facilitates easier movement.In conclusion, the benefits of upgrading roads, as outlined above, are compelling and essential. I strongly support this idea and hope that the government will prioritize investment in road infrastructure, recognizing its critical importance.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;"Life is filled with challenges, difficulties, and unexpected obstacles. To navigate these, it's essential to learn about life and develop the assertiveness to overcome them. There are two primary ways to learn about life: seeking advice from family and friends, and learning through personal experience. Both methods have their unique advantages and are worth considering.On the one hand, learning from the advice of family and friends can be a more practical approach. Family members, such as parents, have accumulated life experience and can offer valuable guidance on various aspects of life. Friends, being from the same generation, can provide insights tailored to your interests and abilities, helping you distinguish between suitable and unsuitable options. By listening to their advice, you can avoid many unforeseen pitfalls.On the other hand, discovering life through personal experience can foster independence and maturity. For instance, if you had never tried skydiving because a friend warned you of its dangers, you would have missed the exhilaration of free-falling. Moreover, constantly relying on family and friends for advice can lead to dependency and a lack of self-reliance. In contrast, taking charge of your decisions and actions, without being overly concerned about consequences, is a path that many successful individuals have chosen.In my opinion, both methods are beneficial, but I prefer learning through personal experience. Growth is a prolonged process that requires hands-on experience. I believe that by navigating real-life situations myself, I can gain more profound insights than simply following advice. After all, our parents and predecessors learned from their own experiences; why shouldn't the younger generation do the same?In conclusion, each approach to learning about life has its benefits. However, learning through personal experience seems more appealing to me. This method allows individuals to develop resilience, independence, and a deeper understanding of the world, ultimately leading to greater personal growth and success."
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;Everyone experiences joyful moments throughout their life, from childhood to adulthood. However, in my opinion, childhood stands out as the happiest phase of a person's life. One reason for this is that children are generally happier than adults. Unburdened by the worries of bills, jobs, and future uncertainties, children are free to focus on two simple yet essential things: having fun and learning. Their daily routine is uncomplicated, revolving around school, play, and rest. For instance, my own childhood was filled with carefree afternoons spent playing with friends in the neighborhood, riding my bike, or kicking a soccer ball around. Without the weight of financial concerns or other adult responsibilities, I was able to simply enjoy myself and absorb new experiences. Moreover, childhood is a time of unbridled creativity, as children constantly imagine and invent new games and activities to bring them joy.Another significant aspect of childhood is the educational journey, where people form lasting connections and create unforgettable memories. School years are often filled with milestones, such as discovering first loves, forging lifelong friendships, and, of course, having a tremendous amount of fun. My father, for example, cherishes his school days as the highlights of his life, and he still maintains close ties with some of his former classmates, with whom he occasionally reunites to reminisce about old times.In essence, childhood is, indeed, the most joyful period in a person's life. With only one life and one childhood to live, it's essential to make the most of this fleeting yet formative phase. By embracing and living their childhood to the fullest, individuals can create a foundation for a happy and fulfilling life.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of advanced technology has revolutionized the way we prepare food, making it easier and more convenient than ever before. Modern kitchen appliances, such as microwaves and toasters, have simplified the cooking process, while instant food products can be transformed into delicious meals in a matter of minutes. This shift has significantly improved our lifestyle by making cooking easy, efficient, and time-saving.One of the primary benefits of this change is that people now have more time to pursue other activities they enjoy. For example, housewives are no longer bogged down by lengthy cooking processes and can now allocate their time to more meaningful pursuits, such as spending time with family or pursuing a career. Additionally, people can sleep in later and still have ample time to prepare breakfast, thanks to the quick and easy food preparation options.Furthermore, the ease of food preparation has also enabled people to preserve and enjoy a diverse range of foods at home. Even small meals can now feature a variety of dishes, allowing individuals to choose their preferred options. This development has also encouraged more men to participate in cooking, an activity they may have previously avoided. This transformation can have a positive impact on family dynamics in some cases.In conclusion, the streamlined food preparation process has afforded us more time to engage in other activities, greater flexibility to select from a variety of foods, and increased willingness to cook meals. While there may be other perspectives to consider, the benefits outlined above demonstrate that this change has substantially enhanced our quality of life. Overall, the impact of technological advancements on food preparation has been profoundly positive, and its effects will undoubtedly continue to shape our lives for the better.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The importance of learning independence for young adults is undeniable. However, the ideal time for children to leave their parents' nest is a topic of debate. From my perspective, I firmly believe that staying with parents for a longer period has more advantages than drawbacks for the young adult. My stance is rooted in the benefits of creating lasting memories with parents, saving money, and seeking valuable advice from them.First and foremost, one of the most significant advantages of living with parents for an extended time is the opportunity for the young adult to create and cherish more memories with them. During the early years of their career, it's less likely for them to find employment in their hometown, making it difficult to spend quality time with their parents. By living with their parents for a longer duration, they have more chances to share feelings, engage in physical activities, and travel together, thereby accumulating memories that become priceless over time. Thus, I believe that living with parents is a worthwhile experience.Moreover, residing at home is more economical than living outside. The process of becoming independent often necessitates leaving the family home, which could lead to the burden of renting a house, an additional expense that could be a strain on the parents. Furthermore, other daily expenditures also contribute to significant outgoings. Spending excessively may not yield the desired outcomes that parents wish for their children. In essence, if children live with their parents for a longer time, it can lead to savings for the parents.Another compelling reason for young adults to stay with their parents is the need for parental guidance. When faced with dilemmas, parents can offer comfort and substantial support. Being the individuals most familiar with their child, they are best positioned to provide suitable advice and guidance, helping their child navigate through challenges. Without immediate parental support, the child might suffer more. Therefore, seeking advice from parents enables the young adult to overcome obstacles with greater ease.In conclusion, living with parents for an extended period offers the benefits of creating cherished memories, reducing costs, and receiving valuable advice. Therefore, I firmly believe that staying longer with parents is the more advantageous choice.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;In today's globalized world, where information is readily available, some individuals may argue that zoos have become obsolete. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. I firmly believe that zoos are invaluable to human beings, serving as crucial centers for learning, conservation, and entertainment.First and foremost, zoos play a vital role in educating people about various animal species. For children, zoos are often the first point of contact with the diverse range of animals that inhabit our planet. They provide students with hands-on learning experiences, allowing them to observe animal behavior and characteristics up close. This practical approach to learning biology not only enhances understanding but also offers a welcome break from the monotony of traditional classroom lectures. Additionally, researchers rely on zoos to access a wide range of animal species for their studies, further highlighting the importance of these institutions.Moreover, zoos are instrumental in the conservation of rare and endangered species. By providing safe and nurturing environments, zoos protect animals from the dangers of the wild, such as predators and harsh living conditions. The animals in zoos are fed and cared for by zookeepers, eliminating the need for them to forage for food. This controlled environment also facilitates artificial insemination programs, which are crucial for maintaining the populations of nearly extinct species.Lastly, the unique and fascinating animals found in zoos make them significant tourist attractions. The influx of national and international visitors generates substantial revenue, contributing to the local economy and promoting economic growth. This, in turn, benefits the country as a whole.In conclusion, zoos are multifaceted institutions that not only contribute to the conservation of endangered species but also enrich the lives of people worldwide. I firmly believe that zoos are indispensable and continue to play a vital role in the modern world, offering a combination of education, conservation, and entertainment that is hard to find elsewhere.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;It is evident that parents play a vital role as the first teachers in a child's life, guiding them through the process of learning to walk, speak, and develop into a well-rounded individual. Furthermore, parents equip their children with essential social skills and knowledge, laying the foundation for their future success.From a young age, children are taught fundamental concepts by their parents, which have a lasting impact on their lives. As infants, they are unaware of their surroundings, but through their parents' gentle explanations and descriptions, they begin to understand and learn about the world. Parents bring a vast array of colorful and wondrous things into their child's mind, shaping their perception and comprehension.In addition to basic knowledge, parents also instruct their children on how to become good people. They teach them the importance of gratitude and apologies, demonstrating how to express these sentiments in a respectful manner. Parents clarify the differences between good and bad behavior, while also showing their children how to interact with others in a positive and respectful way. This may seem like a simple task, but it has a profound impact on a child's future, shaping their behavior and preparing them for the challenges of the real world.It is also clear that parents are the ones who love and care for their children the most, providing them with the best possible guidance and advice based on their own experiences. Unlike professionals, parents offer unwavering support and guidance, helping their children develop essential social skills, such as effective communication and good habits. In fact, parental support is a crucial factor that contributes to a person's success in life.In conclusion, parents are indeed the best teachers, providing their children with invaluable knowledge, advice, and love. With their children's development and future in mind, parents strive to create an optimal environment, giving them the tools and foundation necessary to thrive in life.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;In recent years, we have witnessed numerous technological advancements, including the advent of television. While many people argue that TV has a detrimental impact on children due to its potential for violence and inappropriateness, I firmly believe that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. There are two primary reasons that support my stance.Firstly, television offers a wide range of useful and educational programs. In addition to providing up-to-date news, there are numerous shows that cater to educational purposes. If utilized wisely, these programs can serve as a valuable source of information for children. For instance, in Korea, there is a program called EBS that targets children and teenagers, offering lectures on various subjects. Furthermore, documentary films about the lives of influential individuals in Korea can inspire and educate viewers. By leveraging these educational programs, people can gain valuable insights and inspiration, rather than being exposed to negative influences.Moreover, TV can be a helpful tool for stress relief. With a variety of programs, including sports events, children can find solace and respite from the pressures of academic life. Many children nowadays face immense stress due to the pressure to perform well in school. Watching sports programs can be an effective way to alleviate this stress. Personally, I have experienced the benefits of TV in stress relief. When I was overwhelmed with school-related stress, watching a soccer match between Korea and Japan helped me to relax and regain my focus, ultimately enabling me to continue my academic pursuits.In conclusion, while it is true that TV may feature violent or inappropriate content, I believe that when used judiciously, its positive effects on children far surpass its negative ones. With its wealth of educational programs and stress-relieving properties, TV can be a valuable resource for children. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the notion that television has an overall negative impact on children.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;Many entrepreneurs believe that hiring employees for life is the key to ensuring productivity and efficiency in the workplace. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. From my perspective, there are three compelling reasons why businesses should not employ workers for their entire lives.Firstly, a constant influx of fresh ideas and creativity is essential for a company's success. While senior employees can pass on their valuable experience to younger apprentices, it is the newcomers who bring innovative and novel ideas to the table. Moreover, in today's rapidly evolving landscape, staying up-to-date with the latest knowledge and developments is crucial. Younger employees are better equipped to meet these demands, as they possess the energy, inventiveness, and enterprise required to excel in their roles. These qualities are vital in determining a company's ability to thrive.Secondly, long-term employment can lead to stagnation and boredom among staff. Initially, a secure job may seem like the ultimate goal, but as time passes, many employees come to realize that career advancement and competition are essential for personal and professional growth. Many individuals crave challenges and dislike the monotony of a stable, yet unfulfilling job. A stale work environment can lead to depression and negatively impact the enterprise as a whole.Lastly, the economic crisis and financial recession have resulted in soaring unemployment rates. In my opinion, businesses have a responsibility to recruit more workers to address this issue. By doing so, they can provide opportunities for the unemployed to improve their lives and earn a living. Additionally, companies will have access to a diverse pool of human resources, enabling them to maintain a competitive pace of production and foster a culture of innovation.In conclusion, the diverse perspectives and skills that different people bring, the need for variation in one's career, and the necessity to combat unemployment all lead me to believe that employers should not hire staff for life. I firmly believe that forward-thinking employers recognize the importance of providing opportunities to a diverse range of employees, and it is this approach that will ultimately drive business success.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";I concur with the notion that childhood is the most blissful period of one's existence. The absence of responsibilities and daily struggles is not the sole reason for this sentiment, but also the numerous opportunities to acquire new knowledge, the freedom to imagine, and the liberty to express oneself without reservation. As we transition into adulthood, our lives become heavily influenced by the weight of responsibilities. Our daily routines are dictated by societal expectations, with strict guidelines on how to conduct ourselves, from waking hours to attire and behavior. Every move we make is scrutinized and judged by the community, leaving little room for spontaneity or deviation from the norm. In contrast, childhood, despite its own set of responsibilities, offers a relatively greater sense of freedom. The consequences of actions such as tardiness or inappropriate laughter are far less severe than they would be in adulthood, allowing for a more carefree existence.One of the most enchanting aspects of childhood is the constant discovery of new and fascinating aspects of the world. Being new to this planet, every day presents an opportunity to learn novel facts, listen to captivating stories, and witness breathtaking sights. This period is characterized by an unparalleled sense of wonder and awe, as the world is a vast, unexplored territory waiting to be uncovered.The uninhibited use of imagination and the liberty to express thoughts freely are additional hallmarks of childhood. Children are less judged for their expressions, allowing them to foster a vibrant and unbridled imagination. In adulthood, however, individuals are often compelled to express themselves within predetermined boundaries, effectively stifling their ability to think freely or exercise their imagination.In many respects, childhood emerges as the happiest phase of our lives, not solely due to its inherent nature, but also in comparison to the structured and often suffocating lives we lead as adults. In an ideal scenario where boundaries are fewer, social judgement is less pronounced, and freedom of thought is more prevalent, the dynamics might differ. However, given the current state of affairs, it seems inevitable that we will continue to nostalgically yearn for the carefree days of our childhood.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";"Many people believe that the past is irrelevant to the present, as time is constantly moving forward and each new generation is distinct from the previous one. However, despite the rapid pace of change, there is much to be learned from the past, including mistakes, successes, and knowledge from various fields of study.First and foremost, the mistakes of our predecessors are a valuable resource for learning. Given the brevity of life and the importance of preparation, it is essential to learn from others' mistakes to avoid replicating them. Each mistake, whether big or small, holds a treasure trove of experience that can prepare us for the complexities of life. By learning from the past, we can avoid numerous failures and setbacks.Furthermore, the successes of people in the past are equally significant. While learning from mistakes provides an indirect path to achieving goals, studying others' successes offers a direct route. By examining the strategies and methods used by others to attain their objectives, we can adopt and apply them, increasing our chances of success. For instance, Thomas Edison's quote, ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration,"" remains relevant today and will likely continue to be so in the future.Lastly, the past serves as the foundation for developing new knowledge and inventions. Without the knowledge accumulated in the past, we would not be as advanced as we are today. The discovery of America by Columbus, albeit accidental, paved the way for the country to become a world leader. Similarly, the discovery of gravity by Newton, inspired by the falling apple, has enabled contemporary scientists to study the Earth's gravity. These examples illustrate the invaluable knowledge that the past has bestowed upon us, and it is imperative that we do not ignore them.In conclusion, the past, with its mistakes, successes, and knowledge, has a profound impact on our lives today. Rather than disregarding it, we should utilize the past to forge a better and brighter future. By learning from the experiences and achievements of our predecessors, we can navigate the complexities of life more effectively and make meaningful progress."
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The 20th century marked the beginning of space exploration, allowing humans to venture beyond Earth's boundaries. The United States and Russia have been at the forefront of this endeavor, allocating significant budgets to research and development. In my opinion, investing in space exploration is crucial for the long-term survival of humanity. Many governments, however, view space exploration as a luxury that diverts resources from more pressing issues, such as finding new habitats for human civilization. Despite achieving remarkable technological advancements, including the development of rockets, humans have yet to discover a habitable planet. Throughout history, our planet has faced numerous threats from celestial bodies, posing a significant danger to human existence. Therefore, finding an alternative home in another planet is of paramount importance. Space exploration has also been utilized as a tool for demonstrating military prowess, particularly during the Cold War. In the future, countries may employ space technology to develop new missiles and defensive systems, potentially escalating the space race. The historical context of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, where both nations competed to send humans to the moon, exemplifies the role of space exploration in showcasing military strength. As a result, space exploration will likely continue to serve as a means of asserting military power for many countries.In conclusion, allocating funds to space exploration is not a wasteful endeavor, as it may ultimately contribute to the preservation of human civilization. Although space exploration was initially driven by the desire to discover new worlds, its purpose has evolved, with many governments now utilizing space technology for military applications, altering the primary objectives of space exploration.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";Television is one of the most significant innovations that we use daily, offering both benefits and drawbacks. While some argue that TV has hindered communication among friends and family, I firmly believe it has had the opposite effect. TV programs often become popular conversation topics and provide a great opportunity for social gatherings. Furthermore, modern TVs feature smart systems that enable users to stay connected with others.Firstly, watching TV may consume a significant portion of our daily time, but it also facilitates social interactions. For instance, discussions about weather forecasts and sports programs can bring people together and spark conversations. Secondly, mealtimes often coincide with TV watching, fostering a sense of togetherness among family and friends. I recall gathering with friends to watch movies on a VHS player, which was reminiscent of a cinematic experience. Thirdly, TV can serve as a means of communication. With the advent of smart TVs and multimedia devices like Google TV and WDTV, users can utilize apps such as Skype and Tango to connect with others. Additionally, teenagers can engage in online gaming with friends, further facilitating communication through TV.In conclusion, while TV may distract us from our loved ones, it can also bring families together and encourage conversation. As a medium of modern communication, I believe TV helps people stay connected with each other.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;There is an ongoing debate about whether it's better to let a friend make a mistake or take action that risks damaging the friendship. Many people believe that a mistake can have severe consequences. However, I argue that preserving a friendship is more important than a friend's mistake, no matter how terrible it may be. In this essay, I will present two reasons that support my opinion.Firstly, mistakes are temporary and fleeting, whereas friendships are long-lasting. Mistakes are often forgotten over time, and only those with a closed mind continue to dwell on them. I'd like to illustrate this point with a personal anecdote: my friend Lee once broke a precious gift of mine, but I was able to forget about it and move on after just two days. While some might think I'm being overly forgiving, I believe that mistakes are more forgettable than the importance of a friendship.Secondly, everyone makes mistakes, and if we were to end a friendship every time a friend erred, we would soon find ourselves without any friends. While I acknowledge that some mistakes are too severe to be ignored, and may necessitate ending a friendship, I believe that minor mistakes should be met with understanding and forgiveness. After all, a friend is a precious gift in our lives. According to a study, 85% of people consider a friend to be the best gift they could receive.In conclusion, I firmly believe that a minor mistake cannot break a friendship. Friendships are a lifelong treasure, and the gift of having a friend in our lives is far more valuable than any mistake they might make.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;In today's highly competitive society, parents have a significant responsibility to teach their children the skills necessary to survive and become independent. Just as animals teach their offspring essential skills like foraging, parents can guide their children towards self-sufficiency using various methods, such as assigning household chores or encouraging them to clean their rooms on their own. In my opinion, I firmly believe that having a part-time job is an excellent way for teenagers to prepare for adult life, and I'd like to outline several reasons why.Firstly, when teenagers secure a job, they earn their own money, reducing their reliance on pocket money from their parents. This independence provides them with the opportunity to learn how to manage their finances effectively. Personally, I found this to be true when I started working at the age of 16 during summer vacation. After earning my own money, I was tasked with buying a textbook at the beginning of the semester. However, I initially spent most of my earnings socializing with friends. This experience taught me the importance of budgeting and planning before spending, a lesson that has had a lasting impact on my life.Secondly, taking on a part-time job instills a sense of responsibility in teenagers. For instance, if a student is frequently late to their job, they may face reduced pay or even termination. In contrast to the relatively mild punishments faced in school life, this real-world consequence teaches them to adhere to rules and take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, to aid their children in adapting to adult life, parents should provide them with as much real-world experience as possible. Based on the reasons outlined above, encouraging children to take on part-time jobs is a prudent decision, as it prepares them for the challenges and responsibilities of adult life.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;Growing up in a big city is undoubtedly beneficial for children, provided that a suitable neighborhood is chosen. My conviction is rooted in two primary reasons: academic and social advantages.Some individuals assume that children raised in big cities spend most of their time indoors, glued to computers or video games. However, this is not the case when living in a neighborhood with peers of similar age, as I did. My friends and I would engage in outdoor activities like soccer, biking, and tree climbing on a daily basis. While we did play video games, it was not our primary pastime. Big cities offer a diverse range of people and a wider variety of activities.I have a friend who grew up in the countryside, and he mentioned that he had to study extensively to pass the university entrance exam. This highlights another disadvantage of growing up in rural areas. In contrast, big cities boast more qualified teachers and better access to technology.In my opinion, growing up in the countryside is not an ideal experience. The social circle is limited, gossip is rampant, and life can be quite restrictive. If I were to have children in the future, I am confident that raising them in a good neighborhood in a big city would be the best decision, and they would be thrilled about it.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;I strongly concur with the notion that parents are the most effective educators. To children, their parents are uniquely special, making them the most influential individuals in their lives.There are several reasons why parents hold such significant sway over their children's development. Firstly, the words and actions of parents carry immense weight with their children, far surpassing the influence of friends or other adults. For instance, if another person advises a child against a particular behavior, but the child's parent endorses it, the child is likely to follow the parent's guidance, even if it's misguided. This underscores the considerable power parents wield over their children's perceptions and decisions.Secondly, children typically spend a substantial amount of time with their parents, providing ample opportunity for parental guidance to shape their thoughts, behaviors, and values. The proximity and intimacy between parents and children facilitate a deep and lasting impact, unmatched by other relationships.Lastly, children often emulate their parents, adopting their behaviors, attitudes, and values. This mirroring effect is a crucial aspect of child development, as children learn and absorb lessons from their parents even when no intentional teaching is occurring. Unfortunately, this also means that negative behaviors, such as violence or disrespect, can be inadvertently passed on to children, who may then replicate these patterns in their own lives. For example, a child who grows up in an environment where they witness gender-based violence or disrespect is more likely to exhibit similar behaviors themselves.In conclusion, I firmly believe that parents are indeed the most significant teachers in a child's life. It is imperative, therefore, for parents to be mindful of their actions and the messages they convey to their children, as these have the potential to profoundly shape the person their child will become.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The advent of advanced technology has revolutionized the way we prepare and consume food. This development has made cooking easier and has significantly enhanced the flavor and quality of food. As a result, people's lives have improved in numerous ways. Two significant advantages of this technological progress are the saving of time and the ability to prepare high-quality meals without requiring extensive culinary skills.Firstly, individuals often have packed schedules, leaving them with limited time to spend in the kitchen. However, with the convenience of modern appliances like microwaves and ovens, preparing a delicious meal has become a straightforward process. For instance, an engineer working on a project with a tight deadline can save a considerable amount of time by using a microwave to prepare their meal instead of cooking from scratch. This ease of food preparation is a significant time-saver, allowing individuals to focus on other important tasks.Secondly, in the past, preparing a good meal alone required a high level of culinary expertise. Nowadays, thanks to technological advancements, it is relatively easy to prepare a healthy and tasty meal. For example, if someone wants to cook a special dinner, they can simply purchase pre-prepared meals that come with easy-to-follow instructions. Typically, these meals only require heating in the oven for a specified period, making the cooking process incredibly simple.In conclusion, the ease of food preparation, facilitated by technological development, has contributed significantly to the improvement of people's lives. However, it is crucial for individuals to be mindful of their dietary choices, as some industrially produced foods can have detrimental effects on health. Therefore, it is advisable to opt for products from reputable brands to ensure a balance between convenience and health.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The topic of debate is whether schools should mandate regular standardized exams for students. This issue has garnered significant attention in recent times, with many people questioning its relevance. However, I firmly believe that standardized tests are a valuable component of the educational system, as they enable teachers to assess whether students are genuinely acquiring knowledge.First and foremost, standardized tests are beneficial because they facilitate fair grading by teachers. Some students may not actively participate in lessons due to their prior familiarity with the subject matter. In such cases, exams provide teachers with the only means to evaluate the true capabilities of these students. Moreover, many teachers rely heavily on exam results when grading their classes, making standardized tests the preferred option.Furthermore, standardized tests offer students the opportunity to apply their knowledge in a practical setting. Certain students may develop a habit of merely replicating solved problems from the blackboard, without attempting to solve them independently. Standardized tests, however, provide them with the chance to do so. It is evident, therefore, that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as this benefits both the students and the educational system as a whole.Lastly, I believe that requiring students to take standardized tests is the correct decision, as it enables teachers to compare the knowledge levels of different students. In any given class, there will be students who exhibit low academic performance, and teachers can focus their attention on these students more intensively. I support the arguments of those who advocate for standardized tests over those who do not, because if teachers are aware of each student's knowledge level, they can allocate their time fairly among all students.In conclusion, I firmly believe that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are justified in doing so. This is due to the fact that these schools can conduct a qualitative assessment of whether they are providing their students with an appropriate education. By incorporating standardized tests, educational institutions can ensure that their students are receiving a high-quality education, and that teachers are able to identify areas where students require additional support.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";"The age-old proverb ""Knowledge is power"" underscores the significance of education. In my opinion, universities should offer free education to interested scholars. Nowadays, reputable universities charge exorbitant fees, making affordability a major concern. I've noticed that many enthusiastic scholars are unable to secure admission to top universities because they have to balance work with their studies, leaving them with no choice but to prioritize work over education.The issue of affordability has become a pressing concern for students, as universities are increasingly viewed as businesses driven by profit. The rising cost of education is leading many to opt for self-financed education just to gain admission. Scholars already face numerous challenges, including stringent academic requirements, and are further burdened by expenses such as accommodation, food, travel, and clothing.Furthermore, balancing work and study is a daunting task for scholars, who require undivided attention to their academic pursuits. Research-oriented programs like MPhils and PhDs demand full concentration and dedication. The concept of free education would empower motivated scholars to pursue degrees from esteemed universities without financial constraints.Therefore, universities must address the challenges faced by scholars and prioritize the dissemination of knowledge over profit. Their mission should be to inspire and motivate scholars, fostering a culture of education that enriches our society and boosts literacy rates. By doing so, universities can fulfill their role in promoting the advancement of knowledge and empowering future generations."
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;While university professors are primarily teachers, responsible for imparting knowledge, it's essential to acknowledge the significant impact of their research work. In my opinion, a professor should prioritize research over teaching for several compelling reasons.A professor is, by definition, a researcher and expert in their field, and it's crucial for them to maintain their passion and stay updated on the latest developments. This not only enhances their teaching but also inspires them to continuously improve. For instance, I recall a professor, Mr. Yang, who was outstanding in his dedication to research and reading. He not only taught us effectively but also showed us how to study efficiently on our own, earning him an excellent teacher rating from my classmates.From a student's perspective, while we can acquire knowledge from textbooks, the internet, or teachers, we rely on professors for research opportunities and academic growth. If a professor is not actively engaged in research, they cannot provide us with these opportunities. Moreover, a research-focused professor is constantly generating new ideas, which can stimulate students to think creatively and contribute innovative suggestions, benefiting both the professor and the students.Professors are essentially the pillars of society, leading in various fields of science, arts, culture, and more. Their research is pivotal in driving technological advancements, preserving cultural heritage, and uncovering historical information. Without their research, progress in these areas would be significantly hindered.In conclusion, it is imperative for professors to dedicate a substantial amount of time to research throughout their academic careers. In fact, allocating more time to research than to teaching is not only justified but also necessary for the advancement of knowledge, the inspiration of future generations, and the overall progress of society.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;The impact of television and movies on people's behavior is undeniable, and it's a mixed bag of both positive and negative influences. However, I believe that the negative influences outweigh the positive ones. These media often encourage unhealthy habits, social isolation, and the adoption of artificial personas.For instance, watching television often goes hand-in-hand with consuming unhealthy snacks, such as chips and pizzas, which are high in fat and detrimental to our health. It's no secret that these foods are detrimental to our well-being, and companies capitalize on this behavior by advertising these products on TV, leading to increased consumption and a rise in obesity-related diseases.Furthermore, excessive TV and movie watching can lead to social withdrawal, particularly among children. Instead of interacting with family and friends, they spend more time glued to the screen, resulting in decreased communication with parents and a sense of isolation. Even when people watch TV or movies together, it often leads to less conversation and social interaction compared to engaging in activities like board games.The advertisements that bombard us during TV and movies can also have a profound impact on our self-perception. These ads create unrealistic beauty standards, making people feel inadequate and compelling them to spend money on beauty products or gym memberships to attain an unattainable ideal. Similarly, when characters in movies engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking, it can influence viewers, especially young and impressionable ones, to adopt these habits as well.While TV and movies can be entertaining, I firmly believe that their negative influences on our behavior are more significant. To maintain a healthy lifestyle, be true to oneself, and nurture relationships with family and friends, it's essential to limit our exposure to these media. By being mindful of the potential downsides of TV and movie watching, we can make informed choices about how we spend our time and cultivate healthier habits.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When traveling to new destinations, many individuals enjoy visiting museums, while others do not share the same enthusiasm. Personally, I make it a point to visit museums when exploring a new place, as it allows me to gain insight into the local culture, tradition, and history.One of the primary reasons people are drawn to museums while traveling is that they offer a vast amount of information about various aspects of the history and culture of a given location. Additionally, visiting museums provides an opportunity to meet new people and establish connections, which can lead to engaging conversations and a deeper understanding of the local context. This type of knowledge not only broadens one's perspective but also reflects positively on the individual.On the other hand, some people find museum visits to be the most boring part of a trip. My cousin Pedro, for instance, generally dislikes visiting museums. However, his experience at the famous Madame Tussaud museum in London was an exception. He found it to be a unique blend of art and entertainment, which helped him appreciate the artist's work and sparked a newfound respect for other forms of art found in museums.In conclusion, museums serve as a valuable resource for understanding the history, tradition, and culture of any place in the world. I believe that visiting museums is both an enjoyable and educational experience, offering something for everyone.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"A celebrity once said, ""A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues."" In today's fast-paced world, where noise and crowds dominate our social environment, people often neglect their behavior and manners, leading to rudeness towards others. Some suggest that we should not expect people to be polite to one another. However, I strongly disagree with this attitude, and my explanations are as follows.Firstly, a person with good manners creates a positive impression on others. This impression enables them to easily connect with their community and build relationships. For instance, when I started working at a new company, my good manners and respectful treatment of everyone helped me gain acceptance from my colleagues and approval from my employers. In contrast, being rude would have led to difficulties in getting along with others, ultimately resulting in me losing my job.Secondly, politeness earns respect and fosters positive relationships. Not only do polite and kind words help the speaker build a good reputation, but they also encourage and uplift those who are in need. A successful organization relies on respectful and pleasant relationships among its members. Numerous examples demonstrate that individuals with polite manners are more likely to succeed, as their behavior makes their partners and opponents appreciate their own dignity.Lastly, a civilized society requires a certain level of social order, which is directly tied to the quality of its people. To create a better living environment for ourselves and future generations, it is essential that our behavior is guided by politeness and good manners. By adopting these measures, we can expect a significant reduction in crime rates.In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should strive to be polite to one another, even in today's busy and crowded world. By doing so, we can build stronger relationships, foster respect, and create a more civilized and harmonious society."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;"There's a well-known saying that ""failure is the mother of success,"" suggesting that difficulties can be a valuable stepping stone to achieving success. Some people believe that overcoming challenges at a young age can lead to a life of prosperity and fortune. While others disagree, I firmly believe that facing tough experiences early on can be incredibly beneficial in the long run.To begin with, hardship teaches individuals to appreciate the small, yet wonderful things in life, such as a beautiful day or a delicious meal. People with this mindset tend to find true fulfillment and avoid being swayed by greed, which can lead to self-destruction. As a result, they learn to maintain a positive attitude and confidence, even in the face of adversity.Moreover, those who have faced numerous difficulties tend to remain calm in times of crisis. Having already overcome obstacles, they possess the knowledge and skills to navigate challenging situations. This enables them to effectively lead others and achieve their career goals, despite any hurdles that may arise.In conclusion, I strongly believe that embracing difficulties and appreciating the small pleasures in life are essential to personal growth. I think that tough experiences can be a priceless treasure, ultimately leading to success. It's worth remembering that avoiding challenges can actually lead to more problems, whereas facing them head-on can lead to a more fulfilling life."
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree that city life surpasses rural life in numerous aspects. To begin with, cities boast a significantly superior education system. The schools and universities in urban areas are well-equipped with modern facilities, and renowned professors are drawn to these institutions. This creates an environment conducive to learning and intellectual growth.Moreover, I firmly believe that cities offer a wider array of job opportunities compared to the countryside. Not only are there more positions available, but they are also better paid. Although the cost of living in a city is higher, the increased incomes more than compensate for this difference.Additionally, urban areas are densely populated, which translates to a vast cultural diversity. Interacting with people from various backgrounds and learning about their traditions can be a profoundly enriching experience, capable of influencing one's perspectives and habits in meaningful ways.Another significant advantage of city life is the well-organized public transportation system. Buses and trains operate more frequently in cities than in rural areas, facilitating easier movement and communication.On the other hand, the countryside offers serene landscapes and peaceful environments, ideal for relaxation and escaping the stresses of daily life. The proximity to nature can have therapeutic effects, helping to alleviate worries and sadness.Considering all these factors, I am convinced that city living is preferable in today's world, given the plethora of opportunities it presents. For the most part, rural life is associated with an agricultural lifestyle, which, in my opinion, lacks the dynamism and progression that city life offers. If given the choice, I would undoubtedly opt for city living.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;As the economy grows and people's wealth increases, they begin to prioritize emotional needs like happiness. While I acknowledge that a job can bring happiness to some individuals, I firmly believe that the living environment plays a more significant role in determining happiness for the majority of people.It is undeniable that a job can be a source of happiness. It provides individuals with a sense of purpose and respect, boosting their self-confidence and sense of achievement. Additionally, a job offers financial stability, which is essential for a comfortable life.However, I argue that people should prioritize their living environment over their job. For most individuals, a job is merely a means to sustain their lives, and few people can derive long-term happiness from their work, especially considering the lengthy period of time they spend working - often over 30 years. For instance, workers in factories like FOXCONN, a major manufacturer for Apple, perform repetitive tasks for over 8 hours daily, leading to exhaustion and frustration, rather than happiness.Moreover, a pleasant living environment is a fundamental human need, essential for emotional well-being. The rapid economic growth is, unfortunately, coming at the cost of environmental degradation. Factories release substantial amounts of waste into rivers and soil, while the construction of cities and factories results in the destruction of vast forests. In China, residents living near toxic factories have fallen ill due to the release of harmful waste and water into their surroundings. Although these factories create jobs, the health risks they pose overshadow any potential happiness derived from high-paying employment, as many residents suffer from diseases like cancer.In conclusion, preserving our living environment is far more crucial than focusing on our jobs or work, as the ultimate goal is to lead a fulfilling life. Prioritizing environmental protection will have a more significant impact on our overall happiness and well-being.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;Technology has advanced at an incredible pace, becoming increasingly sophisticated with each passing day. As a result, communication has become heavily reliant on technology, with various methods available, including voice mail, email, telephone, and traditional face-to-face interaction. However, I have a strong preference for email, and my reasoning is threefold: convenience, honest expression, and fluency in communication.It is widely acknowledged that email has revolutionized the way we communicate, enabling us to connect with others across vast distances. For instance, it is possible to maintain contact with someone on the opposite side of the globe, such as communicating with someone in the US while being in Vietnam. This method eliminates concerns about misdelivered messages, as any errors in addressing are immediately apparent. Furthermore, email is remarkably efficient, requiring only a click to send.Moreover, composing emails facilitates honest expression, as some individuals may feel intimidated by face-to-face conversations, leading to a lack of clarity in their communication. For example, discussing sensitive topics, such as a friend's behavior, can be challenging in person, making email a valuable tool for articulating my thoughts. My friend can read and process my email without the pressure of an immediate response, allowing them to fully absorb my perspective without potential distractions or interruptions.Lastly, effective communication requires fluency, which enables individuals to comprehend and retain information accurately. Voice conversations or face-to-face interactions can sometimes make reserved individuals feel less confident, resulting in a disjointed expression of ideas. For instance, when speaking with my parents, I may struggle to articulate my thoughts consecutively, as they may interrupt or respond in a way that causes me to lose my train of thought. Email allows me to organize my ideas coherently, making my expression more persuasive.In conclusion, when comparing all methods of communication, I firmly believe that email is the most superior means of communication for the majority of people. Its convenience saves time, honest expression is essential for effective conversation, and fluency is crucial for articulating persuasive ideas. Overall, email excels in these aspects, making it an indispensable tool in today's technology-driven world.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";"Television offers a wide range of entertaining programs that can be enjoyed at a relatively low cost. Compared to other hobbies like attending theater performances or sporting events, watching TV is a cost-effective way to experience various forms of entertainment. However, in my opinion, the drawbacks of television outweigh its benefits, particularly when it comes to its impact on human interaction.To start with, TV shows can be so engrossing that they distract people from what's truly important. Viewers often become obsessed with their favorite programs and feel compelled to watch them when they air, sacrificing social engagements and appointments with family and friends. For instance, a friend of mine once cancelled plans to play basketball with me so they could watch their favorite show, ""Infinite Challenges"". This not only affected our basketball game but also our friendship, which relies on regular meetups and conversations. By choosing to watch TV alone, my friend missed an opportunity to strengthen our bond.Furthermore, even when people watch TV together, it doesn't necessarily foster conversation or social interaction. Watching TV with others can be similar to watching alone, as it doesn't require active participation or engagement. This can hinder people's ability to build closer relationships. In fact, research suggests that most people don't engage in conversations with their family members when watching TV together. This behavior is understandable, given that TV shows don't encourage audience participation.In conclusion, I strongly believe that excessive TV watching can be detrimental to communication among friends, family, or social groups. The passive nature of TV viewing can lead to obsession and a lack of meaningful interaction, ultimately causing people to disengage from each other. By mindlessly staring at the screen, individuals miss out on opportunities to connect and build stronger relationships with those around them."
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;While many individuals prefer to communicate through telephone calls or in-person conversations, I personally believe that exchanging emails or leaving voice messages is a more effective way to communicate. There are several key reasons that support this idea, which I will outline in this essay.First and foremost, communicating via email is a straightforward process. Many people struggle with making phone calls to individuals they don't know well. In such cases, sending an email or leaving a voice message is a more comfortable option, even for those who are shy or introverted, as it allows them to feel more confident.Another significant advantage of email communication is its flexibility in terms of timing. Given my busy schedule, which includes both work and university studies, my available time is limited during the day. I often find myself returning home late at night, around midnight, and still needing to address questions and resolve routine issues. In such a tight schedule, finding the time to make a call or meet someone at an appropriate hour can be challenging. Therefore, leaving a voice message or sending an email is a more convenient option for me.Thirdly, the process of writing an email provides ample time for careful consideration of the content and tone. For instance, one can reorder words, choose a more suitable style, or ensure that the tone is polite. This level of control over the communication is not as easily achievable in face-to-face conversations, where the spontaneity of speech can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.Lastly, emailing eliminates the risk of disturbing others at an inopportune moment. Unlike phone calls, which can interrupt important conversations or other engagements, emails can be opened and responded to at the recipient's convenience, without fear of intrusion.In conclusion, while I find both methods of communication viable, for important yet non-urgent matters, I prefer to respond via email or voice mail. This method offers a combination of ease, flexibility, control over communication, and respect for the recipient's time, making it, in my view, a superior choice for many situations.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;Firstly, making a quick decision often means that it hasn't been thoroughly thought out or examined from all angles. As a result, rapid decision-making can lead to unfavorable outcomes. For instance, if someone quits their job without carefully considering alternative options or a backup plan, they may end up unemployed due to their impulsive decision.Moreover, rushing into a decision can also cause someone to miss out on a potential opportunity. In other words, if they had taken the time to think it through, they might have discovered a job opening at the same company, but in a different position, and therefore wouldn't have become unemployed.Furthermore, hasty decisions not only lead to waste but can also have a profound impact on a person's entire life. To put it differently, after quitting their job and becoming unemployed, the individual may no longer be able to pay their bills or afford their daily necessities, causing their life to take a turn for the worse.As evident from these examples, a hurried decision is rarely a good one. This is why it's essential to carefully and slowly evaluate decisions to ensure that the choice being made is the best possible one. By doing so, individuals can avoid the negative consequences of impulsive decision-making and make more informed, thoughtful choices that lead to better outcomes.
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile has become an integral part of daily life, with many individuals relying on their cars for transportation. The significance of cars is evident in the fact that they are used daily by numerous people, highlighting their importance. I strongly agree that cars have enhanced modern life, and there are several reasons to support this claim.One of the primary advantages of cars is that they enable people to cover long distances in a relatively short period, leading to numerous benefits. For instance, cars have made it possible for people to maintain relationships over great distances by allowing them to visit each other regularly. From personal experience, I can attest that my car has been instrumental in helping me stay in touch with my childhood friends, despite living in a different city. I was also able to establish a relationship with someone who lived 89 kilometers away, thanks to my car, which enabled us to meet on weekends. Without my car, it's unlikely that we would have been able to develop our relationship.Additionally, cars have increased employment opportunities by allowing people to commute to work and take up jobs farther away from home. They also offer greater flexibility, as evidenced by my father's experience. He has worked all over Germany, earning a higher income, and used his car to travel to different parts of the country, working during the week and returning home on weekends. If he didn't have a car, he would have been unable to spend time with his family on weekends, making his automobile a valuable asset, both financially and socially.Lastly, cars have made it possible for people to travel more frequently, broadening their understanding of the world. Without cars, people are likely to spend most of their lives in their hometown or village, relying on public transportation, which limits their access to certain areas. There are still many places worldwide that cannot be reached by public transport and can only be visited by car. Consequently, car owners have greater access to more places and are more likely to explore the world.In conclusion, the benefits of cars, including flexibility in travel, social life, and employment, outweigh the drawbacks, such as pollution. Flexibility is essential in nearly all aspects of life, and cars provide the ultimate flexibility, making them an indispensable part of modern life.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;When selecting a career, it's essential to think it through carefully. The decision to pursue a job similar to that of one's parents can be a topic of debate, with varying opinions. Personally, I believe that choosing a career path similar to one's parents' can have numerous benefits.Firstly, since parents are familiar with the industry, they can offer valuable support, including domain knowledge and industry-related information. For instance, my father, a software programmer, has taught me a great deal about programming and computer science. Whenever I encounter difficulties, I can consult him, and his extensive experience enables me to save a significant amount of time in finding solutions. This, in turn, makes me more competitive than my peers. If I were to work in a different field, I would likely face more challenges.Moreover, parents who have worked in their industry for many years have accumulated a rich network and possess deep insights. They can provide guidance on which companies offer better benefits or education and training programs. Additionally, their industry connections can even assist with writing recommendation letters, which are extremely valuable in today's competitive job market. Having a strong recommendation letter can give one a significant advantage, allowing them to bypass the initial stages of the interviewing process while others are still working on their resumes.Some may argue that the job market is constantly changing, and therefore, choosing a career similar to one's parents' may not always be the best decision. I partially agree with this viewpoint, but predicting trends is notoriously difficult. The job market is highly volatile, and it's impossible to foresee which careers will remain in demand for an extended period.In conclusion, when considering whether to choose a career similar to one's parents', I have highlighted several reasons why having parents in the same industry can provide valuable support and guidance. I firmly believe that parents can help their children navigate a smoother career path, making it a worthwhile consideration when selecting a career.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;In the 19th century, television was one of the most significant inventions and became an indispensable appliance in every household. Due to its accessibility and entertaining programs, television attracted audiences of all ages and backgrounds. However, the issue of children watching TV has sparked a heated debate about whether their viewing time should be limited. In my opinion, I firmly believe that children should not be allowed to watch excessive amounts of television or movies.Firstly, children often lack self-control, which makes it easy for them to waste time watching TV instead of doing their homework. This was a problem I faced in my own childhood. As soon as I returned home from school, I would immediately turn on the TV and watch for hours on end. I could easily memorize TV channels and programs, but I struggled to recall even a single word from my textbook. As a result, my academic performance suffered greatly due to my lack of studying.Moreover, some TV programs contain violent and explicit content that can be harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to discern what is good or bad, and they may imitate the behaviors they see on TV out of curiosity. Unfortunately, this can lead to negative consequences, such as smoking or violent tendencies. According to some statistics, there is a growing trend of children exhibiting violent behavior, which is often attributed to the influence of TV programs and movies. It is clear that exposure to such content can have a detrimental impact on children's mental and physical health. How can we expect children to perform well in school if they are exhibiting such abnormal behaviors?Some may argue that watching TV and movies can help children develop social relationships with their peers by providing them with topics of conversation. I partially agree with this viewpoint, as it is true that TV and movies can offer a shared experience that can facilitate social interaction. However, this does not mean that children should be allowed to watch TV and movies excessively or without supervision.In conclusion, I strongly believe that children's TV and movie watching time should be constrained. Children are poor at managing their time and lack the maturity to make good judgments about what they watch. Therefore, it is essential to monitor and limit their screen time to ensure that they are not exposed to harmful content and can maintain a healthy balance between entertainment and academic responsibilities.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The salaries of professional athletes and entertainers are staggering, and it's difficult for most people to comprehend how they can earn such vast amounts of money. The significant disparity in earnings between these celebrities and the general public raises questions about whether they truly deserve their lucrative compensation. From my perspective, I firmly believe that they do merit this high level of pay.Firstly, a worker's salary should be a reflection of their competence and value in their chosen career. Consequently, those who receive high salaries must have demonstrated exceptional abilities and achieved remarkable feats in their respective fields. They are not paid handsomely without justification. In today's competitive world, it's essential to showcase one's talents and convince employers that they deserve a higher salary. This principle applies to all professions, which is why the wealthiest athletes are often the most talented, such as Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Secondly, high salaries can also serve as a guarantee and support for outstanding performances. While many of us only see the luxurious lifestyle of wealthy athletes, we often overlook the numerous challenges they've faced and the significant investments they've made in themselves. Their high salaries are, in part, a reward for their hard work and dedication. In other words, if they were not compensated adequately for their performances, we might not witness the same level of brilliance that amazes us.Some may argue that the gap between rich athletes and ordinary people is too vast, seeming unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal opportunities to pursue their dreams and careers, the system is fair. Fairness is not about equal pay for everyone, but rather equal access to achieving the same goals and accomplishments.In conclusion, high salaries for athletes are a just reward for their achievements and a guarantee of high-quality performances. This compensation serves as a positive incentive, encouraging more talented individuals to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, ultimately providing us with exceptional performances to enjoy.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";"In our daily lives, we interact with diverse individuals and receive varied opinions about ourselves and our work, which can be either positive or negative. While it's easy to accept praise, criticism can be challenging to accept. This leads to the notion that people who are unable to accept criticism from others are unlikely to succeed in collaborative work environments. I personally concur with this statement.Firstly, the foundation of collaborative work is ""consensus,"" where every individual's opinion holds value. In group projects, members engage in brainstorming discussions, weigh all possible solutions, and ultimately reach a collective agreement. This process inherently involves the exchange of diverse opinions. If one member insists solely on their idea and refuses to consider criticism from others, the collaborative effort falls apart. Since the work belongs to all members, not just one individual, it's essential for each member to respect others' opinions.Secondly, accepting criticism is a valuable trait, as it involves considering opposing viewpoints. Even when working independently, one must be open to criticism from others. Criticism can be hurtful, as it highlights one's weaknesses and forces confrontation. However, it also presents an opportunity to identify and rectify these weaknesses, provided one is willing to accept it. Those who refuse to accept criticism will ultimately miss out on chances for growth. In other words, the inability to accept criticism not only hinders cooperation with others but also leads to personal failure. As a Chinese idiom states, ""Good medicine tastes bitter."" Criticism can be a potent solution for improvement.Some might argue that criticism can be misguided, leading one astray. What if the criticism is incorrect, and the seemingly reasonable feedback leads to a wrong direction? Doesn't insistence on one's beliefs also demonstrate strong character? In my opinion, even if one is correct, criticism remains beneficial. It serves not only as a means to rectify mistakes but also as a test of one's knowledge and understanding of their work. Accepting criticism doesn't necessitate blind acceptance; rather, it's essential to maintain one's own judgment. The ability to effectively utilize criticism is an art form.In conclusion, criticism is crucial, particularly in collaborative work environments, but also in other situations. It serves as a reflective mirror, revealing our flaws and prompting us to improve and become more confident. By embracing criticism, we can refine our work, enhance our personal growth, and develop the resilience needed to succeed in both group and individual endeavors."
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;Every parent aspires for their child to be outstanding and successful, and to achieve this, they often start cultivating their children from a very young age. In addition to basic subjects like language and science, music and art are typically at the top of the list of essential skills for parents to teach their children. In my opinion, I firmly believe that children should learn music and art at a young age, as they offer numerous benefits.Firstly, it is ideal for children to develop their sense of music and art when they are young, as they possess a natural ability to absorb and learn quickly. Children have a vivid imagination, which is a crucial element in music and art, allowing them to think creatively and bring new ideas to life. Unlike subjects like math or language, which have strict rules and guidelines, music and art are more abstract and rely on imagination and creativity. Children have the freedom to express themselves without the constraints of reality, and even simple drawings and melodies can bring them immense joy and allow their imagination to soar.Secondly, music and art are lifelong pursuits that are well worth investing time and effort into. They teach us to appreciate beauty, express our feelings in a creative way, and are essential to our spiritual well-being. Even if children do not grow up to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still valuable, as it can enrich their character and serve as a hobby.Some people may argue that parents should not put too much pressure on children to learn multiple skills, as it can be overwhelming for them. However, in my opinion, it depends on how these learning activities are approached. If parents push their five-year-old child to practice piano for eight hours a day, like a professional performer, that is indeed excessive. At a young age, music and art should be introduced as a way to explore the world of art, rather than as a means to acquire specific skills. By approaching it in this way, it will not be a burden on children.In conclusion, the young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art, and these skills are valuable not only during childhood but throughout one's life. Music and art have the power to accompany and enrich a person's spirit, as long as they are given the opportunity to enter their life.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;The art of teaching can be approached in numerous ways. While some individuals believe that meticulously presenting theories in a classroom setting is the most effective teaching method, others argue that incorporating practical applications of those theories is more persuasive. Personally, I concur with the latter viewpoint, which suggests that the most compelling way for educators to pique students' interest in a subject is to illustrate its relevance and applicability to their everyday lives beyond the school walls.Initially, by elucidating how a subject contributes to daily life, students are likely to form a vivid impression of the subject matter, thereby becoming more engaged and proactive in acquiring knowledge about it. For instance, consider chemistry: merely memorizing the names of substances and their structural formulas can be a tedious exercise, whereas demonstrating where and how chemical reactions occur in students' immediate surroundings can spark their curiosity and motivate them to internalize the theories learned in class. During my senior high school years, my chemistry teacher conducted an experiment showing how detergent dissolves oil, subsequently teaching us how to describe this process using formal structural formulas. This pedagogical approach was not only more enjoyable but also yielded positive outcomes. By connecting the visual images of the experiment with the formula, I was able to retain the information with ease, even after I had stopped studying chemistry.Furthermore, by bridging theoretical concepts with everyday life events, students are afforded the opportunity to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios and develop their problem-solving skills. This strategy caters to students' interests as it involves real-life participation and practical application. For example, in a law class, students are informed about their rights and duties, and taught how to apply legal principles to various situations that may arise in their lives. When such situations occur, they can think critically and determine an appropriate course of action.In conclusion, utilizing life experiences and examples to demonstrate subject matter is an efficacious method for capturing students' attention and sustaining their enthusiasm for learning. This approach not only reinforces students' impression of the knowledge but also invites them to practice and apply it in their own lives, thereby rendering the learning experience more engaging, relevant, and effective.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;"In the 21st century, two paramount issues dominate the global agenda: environmental protection and economic development. Both are crucial for human welfare and the future, but due to limited resources and budgets, governments are often forced to prioritize one over the other. In my view, addressing environmental issues should take precedence over economic development, and here's why.Firstly, environmental protection is more pressing than economic growth. The Earth is our sole habitat, and without it, all our achievements and advancements would be rendered meaningless, as our very existence would be at stake. Just as a person needs a healthy body to thrive, all living beings collectively need a robust and healthy planet. The urgency of environmental issues surpasses that of economic development because the consequences of neglecting the former are irreversible and catastrophic.Secondly, environmental problems have far-reaching and profound impacts that transcend national boundaries. Unlike economic issues, which can be localized, environmental challenges are inherently global, affecting every nation and population without discrimination. The example of global warming illustrates this point starkly. As temperatures rise, the entire globe suffers together, from the melting of polar ice caps, which not only threatens the habitats of polar animals but also endangers island residents near the equator due to rising sea levels. Environmental issues cannot be compartmentalized by nationality because all humans are inextricably linked through our shared home, the Earth.Some may argue that economic issues are equally global and critical, and thus cannot be neglected. They might posit that economic downturns can lead to immediate and violent reactions from the public, whereas environmental problems seem like chronic conditions that do not escalate as quickly. However, the reality is that we are already witnessing numerous signs and warnings of environmental crises, including global climate anomalies. It would be prudent to acknowledge these warnings rather than continue to prioritize economic development, which, ironically, is often the root cause of environmental degradation.In conclusion, environmental conservation takes precedence over economic development in terms of both urgency and the scope of influence. The analogy of a person's health is apt; just as one cannot be happy while being unhealthy, similarly, we cannot live safely or joyfully on a planet devastated by our own actions. It is imperative that we prioritize the health of our planet to ensure our own well-being and survival."
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;The topic of whether the number of cars on the road will decrease in the next twenty years sparks a significant amount of debate. Opinions are divided, with some individuals believing that the growing concern for the environment will lead to a reduction in car usage, while others argue that personal vehicles are essential for daily life. Both perspectives have their merits, making them convincing to a certain extent. However, I am inclined to agree with the notion that car usage will indeed decrease in the future, and I will outline the reasons that support this viewpoint.Firstly, the improvement in public transportation systems has made commuting significantly more convenient. For instance, living in a city plagued by morning traffic jams and a shortage of parking spaces, I have observed that the increased availability of subway and bus stations has encouraged people to opt for public transport over driving their own vehicles. This shift is not only beneficial for reducing traffic congestion but also for minimizing the need for personal cars.Secondly, driving cars is a major contributor to various forms of pollution, which has become a pressing global issue. As environmental awareness rises, people are more likely to consider the impact of their actions, including their choice of transportation. A notable example is the efficiency of using buses over personal cars. By filling a bus with forty passengers, it not only alleviates traffic congestion by reducing the number of cars on the road but also significantly decreases air pollution in urban areas.Although I concur with the idea that car usage will diminish over the next twenty years, it's essential to acknowledge the counterarguments. Some might argue that personal car usage is necessary because public transportation cannot reach all areas, particularly rural or less accessible regions. This point is valid, especially when considering trips to the countryside or other hard-to-reach locations. Nonetheless, there are often alternative solutions available, such as biking or walking, which not only reduce car usage but also offer health benefits. For example, living in suburbs or planning a trip can be managed with these eco-friendly and healthy transportation methods, making the limitation of public transportation less of an issue.In conclusion, after weighing the advantages and disadvantages of the potential decrease in car usage over the next twenty years, it becomes apparent that the most logical stance is that car usage will indeed decrease. The reasons outlined above, including the convenience of improved public transportation and the environmental benefits of reducing personal vehicle use, strongly support this prediction. As society continues to evolve with a greater emphasis on sustainability and health, the reliance on personal cars is likely to diminish, paving the way for a future with fewer cars on the
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;In higher education, students are afforded a significant amount of autonomy in their learning approaches. While some students rely heavily on attending classes to stay on top of their coursework, others feel that attending classes is unnecessary as long as they can pass their exams. This raises the question of whether attending classes is a necessity for university students, as long as they can achieve academic success. In my opinion, I firmly believe that students should attend classes regardless of their potential exam outcomes.Firstly, attending classes is a more effective way of learning compared to studying alone for the sole purpose of passing exams. Classes are meticulously designed by professors who possess a wealth of knowledge and experience, making them better equipped to guide students towards academic achievement. The structured learning environment and expert guidance provided in classes facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject matter.Secondly, attending classes is a fundamental responsibility of students. It demonstrates respect not only for the professor but also for oneself. Many professors consider class attendance a crucial factor in evaluating student performance, often incorporating it into their grading criteria. In fact, even students who achieve high scores on exams may fail if they have poor attendance records. This underscores the importance of attending classes as an integral part of the learning process.Some might argue that if a student already grasps the course material sufficiently to pass exams, or if they can effectively study the course on their own, then attending classes would be a waste of time. They might suggest that self-study is more efficient. However, I consider this viewpoint to be somewhat arrogant. Professors, due to their experience and qualifications, can offer insights and knowledge that surpass what students can achieve on their own. Furthermore, even the most confident students can benefit from attending classes, as it provides a platform to engage in discussions with both professors and peers, fostering a richer learning experience.In conclusion, attending classes is essential for a thorough learning experience and demonstrates respect for both the professors and oneself. The process of learning, rather than just the outcome of passing exams, is the ultimate goal of education. It is through attending classes and engaging with the academic community that students can truly evaluate their own learning and growth. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the importance of class attendance as a vital component of the university experience.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;When we come across impressive structures like beautiful buildings or airports, it's unlikely that we attribute their existence to chance. Similarly, it's absurd to think that complex global networks like Google or Yahoo were created by luck alone. While some people believe that luck plays a significant role in achieving success, I strongly disagree. In this essay, I will outline my primary reasons for this stance.Firstly, it's evident that famous and successful individuals are often diligent and hardworking, rather than simply lucky. Through dedication and perseverance, one can develop expertise and become a powerhouse in their field. The more we work hard, the less we rely on chance for success. For instance, in a football game, a penalty kick has a 50-50 chance of resulting in a goal. However, a skilled player like Ronaldo is more likely to score than an amateur like myself, not because he's luckier, but because he has put in countless hours of practice and exercise. His success is a direct result of his hard work, not mere luck.Moreover, we cannot rely solely on luck to achieve success. While I acknowledge that luck can play a role, it's unreliable and unpredictable. For example, preparing for a multiple-choice exam like TOEFL requires diligent study and preparation. One cannot simply rely on luck to pass the exam, even with the best of intentions. The wise approach is to study hard and make informed decisions, rather than leaving it to chance.Finally, achieving success in complex projects requires a tremendous amount of learning, planning, and effort. Even the most fortunate individuals cannot manufacture a car or build a skyscraper solely based on luck. Such feats are accomplished by individuals who have mastered their craft through hard work and dedication. These individuals have gained valuable experience and expertise, which enables them to undertake and complete complex tasks.In conclusion, while luck may play a minor role in achieving success, it's the hard work and dedication that ultimately lead to great accomplishments. We should not rely on luck to achieve our goals, but rather focus on putting in the effort and perseverance required to succeed. Great success demands great work, not great luck.
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;People have different preferences when it comes to learning styles, and I believe that both self-directed learning and learning with a teacher have their benefits. On one hand, learning with a teacher can be extremely beneficial, as they can clarify confusing concepts, increase the pace of learning, and provide personalized guidance. This is particularly important for practical subjects, which often require hands-on instruction and supervision. For instance, learning to drive a car, pursuing a career in medicine or engineering, or mastering sports like skiing or swimming, typically necessitate the guidance of a qualified teacher or instructor.A skilled and experienced teacher can significantly enhance the learning process, making it faster and more efficient. When faced with a challenging course that is difficult to comprehend and has limited resources available, I often find myself getting discouraged after investing a significant amount of time. In such situations, seeking the help of a teacher proves invaluable, as they can teach the course effectively and concisely, thereby facilitating quicker and better learning while minimizing confusion and discouragement.Moreover, certain subjects can only be effectively learned with the guidance of a teacher. For example, I learned this lesson the hard way when I initially started learning to play the guitar without a teacher. I developed incorrect strumming and tempo habits, which were later identified and corrected by a tutor, enabling me to play properly. This experience underscored the importance of proper instruction in certain areas.On the other hand, I sometimes prefer learning on my own due to the associated cost and time savings. With the plethora of resources available today, including books, e-books, the internet, TV, and satellite, I can utilize these as self-study tutorials for various subjects. For example, learning English or other languages can be easily accomplished through helpful books and numerous online resources.In conclusion, the decision to learn with a teacher or on one's own depends on the situation. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and I believe that each can be beneficial in different contexts. Ultimately, the key to effective learning lies in choosing the approach that best suits the subject matter and the individual's learning needs.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The advancement of modern technology has made it possible for people to work from anywhere, as long as they have the necessary equipment. This has led to a debate about whether working from home is more effective than working in a traditional office setting. In my opinion, I firmly believe that working in an office is more efficient and productive than working from home.Firstly, working in an office provides the opportunity for instant interaction with colleagues. This facilitates collaboration, discussion, and problem-solving, which are essential for successful project completion. For instance, when working on a group project, team members can quickly assemble and discuss new ideas, making the process more efficient and straightforward than communicating over the phone. Additionally, if technical issues arise, such as computer or internet problems, office staff can be readily available to provide assistance.On the other hand, working from home has several drawbacks that can significantly hinder productivity. For example, home-based work is often plagued by distractions, making it challenging to maintain focus. The ease of access to entertainment, such as television, and the temptation of junk food can easily derail work progress. Moreover, the lack of supervision at home increases the likelihood of procrastination and reduced work effort. Working from home also means missing out on important office events, including crucial announcements from management, which can leave remote workers feeling disconnected and out of the loop.In conclusion, working in an office is undoubtedly more efficient than working from home. The office environment offers the dual benefits of collaborative work opportunities and a structured, professional atmosphere that is difficult to replicate at home. This setting is conducive to higher productivity, better communication, and a stronger sense of team cohesion, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;Achieving success is a universal goal, and there are numerous paths that can lead to it. While some individuals prefer to blend in and wait for opportunities, others choose to stand out from the crowd. In my opinion, being unique is the key to unlocking success. Firstly, being distinct from others often indicates that one has achieved something exceptional. In a competitive world, it's essential to have a unique edge to survive. Those who fail to differentiate themselves can easily be replaced by someone more talented. For instance, during my college days, I was consistently chosen to present group reports because I possessed the ability to present them thoroughly and fluently, setting me apart from my peers.Secondly, being unique allows you to create your own value, which cannot be replicated by others. This means that instead of passively waiting for recognition, you can actively shape your own success. A prime example of this is Apple, one of the most successful and prestigious technology companies. Apple's tremendous success can be attributed to its exceptional qualities, such as its operating systems and designs, which cannot be matched by its competitors. The uniqueness of Apple's design has created its own value, setting it apart from others.In conclusion, embracing individuality and uniqueness is the more promising approach to achieving success. It not only showcases one's competence but also creates a unique value, enabling individuals to take the lead on their path to success. By being different and unique, one can establish a competitive edge, creating a foundation for success that is difficult to replicate.
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;It is undeniable that mathematics, language, science, and history are crucial subjects in a student's education, providing them with a fundamental understanding of the world. Some people argue that these subjects are sufficient for younger students, rendering other subjects unnecessary. However, from my perspective, art and music are equally essential for a younger student's future life, as they offer a unique perspective on the world and provide a much-needed respite from the immense pressure of modern life. I firmly believe that art and music should be a required part of the curriculum.Firstly, art and music broaden a student's horizons, fostering thoughtfulness and an appreciation for diverse cultures. Since art and music transcend national borders, they provide a shared experience that connects people worldwide, symbolizing various cultures. By studying art and music, students can appreciate the works of renowned artists and musicians, and experience the fascination of different cultures. For example, listening to Beethoven's iconic symphony, a masterpiece of European music, can evoke powerful emotions and a deeper understanding of the cultural context.Furthermore, studying art and music serves as an excellent outlet for stress and a superb way to relax. In today's fast-paced life, people often suffer from overwhelming pressure, which can be detrimental to their well-being if left unchecked. Art and music offer accessible tools for modern individuals to liberate themselves from stressful lives. Admiring a brilliant painting, such as the Mona Lisa, can transport people to a world of art, allowing them to momentarily forget their worries and ponder the mysteries of the artwork. This connection to art is rooted in initial exposure and study, highlighting the importance of introducing art and music education at a young age.Admittedly, the study of art and music should be driven by a student's inherent interest. Forcing art and music education can be counterproductive if students resist it. To cultivate interest without adding extra pressure, schools could consider replacing some basic science classes with art and music classes.In conclusion, in modern society, where understanding the complexities of the world is paramount, and people are burdened with excessive pressure, art and music education for younger students should not be marginalized. Instead, it should be valued as a vital component of their educational journey, providing them with a unique perspective, creative outlets, and essential tools for navigating life's challenges.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;When discussing generational issues, people often have differing opinions. Some believe that few things have changed between generations, while others argue that generational differences are evident in every aspect. In my view, I think that every perspective between generations is unique and that the challenges facing this generation are significantly different from those of the previous one.Firstly, in the era of globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation have become increasingly complex. To be successful, one must be able to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing world. In the past, mastering a single skill was sufficient to tackle problems, as industries were relatively small and simple to manage. However, as industries have expanded and become internationalized, individuals are now required to possess multiple skills to meet these challenges. For instance, with the increased opportunities for global business, language skills have become essential in addition to one's profession. Furthermore, the rise of financial crimes in the 21st century has created a high demand for individuals who excel in both law and financial management.Secondly, this generation is grappling with the issue of self-recognition, which was not experienced by previous generations. In the past, people were given less freedom and were often expected to follow the paths laid out by their parents. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to a wide range of creative ideas and are encouraged to think individually. They are eager to discover who they are and what they truly want, which is a fortunate yet challenging experience. They must navigate multiple possibilities and take responsibility for the consequences of their decisions.In conclusion, the challenges facing this generation are more complex and diverse than those of the previous generation, whether in career or self-identification. While it is difficult to judge which generation's problems are more daunting, it is clear that each new generation will face unique challenges. As we look to the future, it is inevitable that the next generation will encounter a new set of challenges, and it is up to them to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing world.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;The debate about whether having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than specializing in one specific subject has sparked intense discussion. While some people believe that specializing in a particular field is the key to success, others argue that having a wide range of knowledge increases one's chances of achieving success. Both arguments seem convincing, but in my opinion, having a broad knowledge base is the key to success. The following points will support my stance.Firstly, having knowledge of various subjects enables individuals to communicate more effectively with people from different backgrounds. For instance, during my time at a large company with multiple departments, my knowledge of engineering courses, which I had studied, allowed me to collaborate seamlessly with colleagues from the Engineering department. This, in turn, made me a popular and reliable point of contact, facilitating my work and earning me the help I needed when required.Secondly, having a broad knowledge base is crucial when transitioning between fields. My cousin Jeff and his friend, who majored in finance, are a case in point. After graduating, they decided to pursue a career in the art industry. Thanks to Jeff's efforts to learn about art history during his free time, he was able to join a prestigious team. In contrast, his friend, who only had knowledge of finance, was limited to working in a bank. This example illustrates the importance of being well-versed in multiple fields.Although I acknowledge the importance of having a broad knowledge base, I must also consider alternative perspectives. Some people may argue that if an individual cannot succeed in their own major, they are unlikely to succeed in other fields. This argument may hold some truth, but it does not account for instances where individuals discover their true talent lies in a different field. In such cases, having a broad knowledge base can be a significant advantage.In conclusion, after weighing the pros and cons of having a broad knowledge base versus specializing in one subject, it is clear that the former is the more beneficial approach. The benefits of being well-versed in multiple subjects, including enhanced communication skills and increased career flexibility, make it an essential aspect of achieving success.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;I wholeheartedly agree with the notion that successful individuals are those who venture into new experiences and take calculated risks. The characteristics that define successful people are often debated, but in my view, two key factors stand out: the ability to learn valuable lessons from trying new things and the necessity of taking bold risks to achieve greatness.By stepping out of their comfort zones, successful people can gain unique and valuable insights that may not be found in books or traditional learning settings. For instance, someone looking to improve their communication skills could try their hand at sales in various settings. This hands-on experience would expose them to diverse personalities and behaviors, allowing them to develop essential people skills that can be applied to various situations and professions in the future.Furthermore, I firmly believe that remarkable success requires a willingness to take significant risks. To reap substantial rewards, one must be prepared to invest heavily in uncertain ventures or make sacrifices, such as dedicating ample time and effort to studying for a crucial exam. The correlation between risk-taking and success is clear: the more you're willing to take risks, the greater your accomplishments will be. Playing it safe, on the other hand, can lead to a mediocre existence with average achievements. Therefore, embracing risk and trying new things is essential for achieving success.In conclusion, I firmly believe that success is inextricably linked to trying new things and taking risks. To attain success, it's crucial to adopt this mindset and be open to new experiences and challenges.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;Firstly, acquiring a deep understanding of the theoretical foundations of our future profession is vital, and this can be achieved through schooling. In school, we have the opportunity to identify the skills required for our future career and work towards mastering them. By studying hard, we increase our chances of performing our job more efficiently and effectively in the future. For instance, an aspiring industrial engineer must thoroughly study their technical courses to apply them effectively in their future role. As evident, diligent academic effort is a critical factor for job success.Another significant factor for success in a future job is effective communication. By relating well to people, we are likely to build a wide network of connections. This, in turn, can yield numerous benefits. For example, when seeking a job, communicating with potential employers who respect us can significantly aid in achieving our career goals. Similarly, as a salesman, building strong relationships with customers can increase the likelihood of them becoming repeat customers. Thus, connecting well with people is also a vital factor.In conclusion, while some may disagree, the reasons and examples I've provided underscore the importance of considering both factors. Neither is independently sufficient, and each has its unique benefits. Therefore, it's essential to focus on both to maximize our chances of success in our future careers.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The presence of advertising in our modern society is undeniable, as it permeates every aspect of our lives and influences our decisions on various matters. This raises the question of whether advertising has a positive impact on our lives, particularly when it comes to eating habits. While some argue that advertising is to blame for unhealthy eating habits, others contend that there are other factors at play. In my opinion, advertising is not the primary cause of unhealthy eating habits.Firstly, advertising is not the sole determining factor in shaping our eating habits. The key to developing healthy eating patterns lies in our understanding of wholesome diets and our ability to exercise self-control. Although advertising can make products appear tempting, regardless of their potential negative effects on our health, it is not the only source of information we have access to. We can acquire diverse viewpoints on food from other sources, such as news articles or magazines. As long as we are informed about how to maintain a healthy body and remain mindful of our eating habits, we can resist the temptations presented by advertising. It is unconvincing to place blame solely on the advertising sector of a fast-food company for our weight issues without reassessing our own behaviors.Secondly, in an era where people are becoming increasingly conscious of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, some companies are responding to this trend by promoting healthy foods. In other words, advertising can actually contribute to healthier eating habits. Consider the recent popularity of organic foods, which are grown without pesticides, and foods with reduced salt or sugar content. These are the key traits that advertising is highlighting, and the overall results are positive. In these cases, the advertising industry is promoting people's awareness of healthy lifestyle choices.In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason for unhealthy eating habits. Rather, it is our understanding of healthy eating habits and our ability to exercise self-control that truly matter. Furthermore, advertising may even lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. While it is inevitable that we will be exposed to an environment filled with advertisements, this does not mean that our autonomy to make choices is taken away. We will always have the ability to decide our own lifestyles.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";In today's world, there are numerous resources available for entertainment, education, and information. One such resource is television, but unfortunately, it has several negative effects on certain individuals. I firmly believe that television has hindered communication among friends and family. Many people spend excessive time watching TV, some even eat while watching, and others prioritize it over social interactions.Firstly, some individuals devote a significant amount of time to watching television, often at the expense of spending time with loved ones. I know someone who starts their day by watching TV, even before eating breakfast, and records programs to watch later, including during work hours. His wife has grown accustomed to his habits and now prefers to communicate with him via email, as he only allows her to talk during commercial breaks. It's essential for people to realize the value of quality time with family and make an effort to engage in meaningful conversations.Another way television has eroded communication is when people cannot even be bothered to have dinner with their family. This is a crucial time for sharing experiences, discussing school projects, and addressing concerns, especially if there are children involved. Similarly, when friends gather for dinner, the presence of television can hinder fluid conversations. Unfortunately, this is the reality in many cases, where family and friends gather to spend quality time together, but the TV takes center stage.Lastly, some people make television a priority, often at the expense of social relationships. I recall a friend telling me that I couldn't visit her at a certain time because she was watching a favorite show. I was taken aback by her response, as it highlighted the excessive importance she placed on television.In conclusion, while television is a valuable tool for learning, entertainment, and staying informed, I agree that it has destroyed communication among friends and family when it becomes a priority, consumes excessive time, or is used as a substitute for human interaction. It's essential to strike a balance between TV time and social interactions to maintain healthy relationships.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;University students can be broadly categorized into two groups: those with limited interest in academics and hardworking students who often have little time for exercise. As we all know, regular exercise, ideally for at least 30 minutes, is essential for a healthy and happy life. However, I believe that the allocation of funds should prioritize academic resources over physical and social activities.In my opinion, investing heavily in gym equipment or sports facilities is not necessary to encourage students to engage in physical activity. For instance, my roommate Mary wakes up at 6 am every day to exercise in the nearby park, and she does so without incurring any costs. Instead, the university could promote the benefits of exercise by posting informative posters around campus, inviting athletes to give lectures, and encouraging students to dedicate time to their physical well-being.Furthermore, students choose their majors based on their interests, and the university should provide the necessary equipment for physical education students, as their field of study is directly related to physical activities. In contrast, for students pursuing engineering or medicine, it would be more beneficial to allocate funds to laboratories rather than gyms, as this would allow them to utilize innovative technology and potentially make groundbreaking discoveries in their field.Additionally, I believe that spending money on social activities is a waste of resources. Students who want to socialize with friends or meet new people tend to prefer off-campus locations where they can interact without being disturbed by familiar faces. For example, when my friends and I want to spend time together, we opt to go off-campus to places where we can enjoy each other's company without interruptions.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of physical activity in the success of university students, I think that sports and social activities should not receive equal funding to libraries and laboratories. The university's priorities should focus on providing top-notch academic resources to support students' intellectual and professional growth.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;The debate about whether having good people skills is more important than academic achievement for securing a successful job in the future is a matter of weighing the pros and cons. However, after careful consideration, I agree with the statement that good people skills are more crucial, and I will explain why.Firstly, friends are a valuable asset in both our personal and professional lives. The ability to relate well to people can bring numerous benefits in the job market. Having a strong network of friends across various fields means that when you encounter problems, you have a multitude of people who can offer assistance, often with just a simple phone call, rather than resorting to complex solutions.Furthermore, regardless of your position within a company, be it a top-level manager or a junior employee, relating well to people is essential. For managers, a good relationship with their subordinates is a prerequisite for the successful completion of projects. They must listen to their employees' needs and complaints, show patience, and care for them, which in turn fosters a positive working relationship. Similarly, for employees aiming to advance their careers, having a good relationship with their superiors is crucial, as it increases their chances of being recognized as excellent performers and subsequently promoted.On the other hand, some might argue that specialized knowledge is more critical for future job prospects. Studying diligently, acquiring a good resume, and absorbing extensive work knowledge can indeed make graduates more competitive in the job market. However, consider two individuals: one excels in work knowledge but lacks people skills, and another has excellent people skills but is less proficient in work knowledge. Who would you rather be? I believe most people would choose the former, as they perceive it offers better job prospects.In my opinion, I prioritize improving my people skills and expanding my social network over merely studying hard. While academic achievement is valuable, the ability to relate and connect with others opens more doors and provides a stronger foundation for success in both personal and professional contexts. Therefore, I firmly believe that good people skills are more crucial than academic rigor alone for achieving a successful job in the future.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.;In today's fast-paced world, life has become increasingly complex, making it more challenging to manage than in the past. As a result, it's crucial for individuals, especially young people, to develop the skill of planning and organization. This ability can significantly enhance the efficiency of our actions, reduce crises, and eliminate unnecessary tasks.Firstly, possessing excellent planning and organizing skills can make our actions more efficient and productive. For instance, I used to feel overwhelmed by the pressure of preparing for final exams, submitting papers, and completing internship work at the end of each term. However, this year, I took my roommate John's advice and created a to-do list to plan and organize everything I needed to accomplish. This planning ability has been incredibly helpful, enabling me to excel in my class and complete all my tasks.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize helps young people avoid crises that can undermine their efforts over a long period. Employees in companies, for example, are expected to generate profits and complete assignments perfectly. Those who lack planning and organization skills may procrastinate and only take action when deadlines are imminent. However, circumstances can change rapidly, such as when a company's schedule is altered, and deadlines are moved forward. In such cases, employees who haven't planned ahead may struggle to complete tasks on time, leading to penalties or even termination. No employee can afford such losses.Some may argue that the ability to plan and organize can be acquired after entering the workforce, and therefore, it's not essential for young people to possess this skill. Nevertheless, this ability is vital for young individuals as it enables them to overcome bad habits and achieve their goals more quickly. For instance, when researching online, young people can easily get distracted by online games, social media, or other attractions, leading to hours of unproductive surfing. However, by creating a plan and sticking to it, they can complete their work efficiently and effectively, often exceeding their expectations.In conclusion, in this complex society, young people are faced with multiple tasks, making the ability to plan and organize an indispensable and powerful tool. It's essential for young individuals to arm themselves with this skill to navigate the challenges of modern life successfully. By doing so, they can enhance their productivity, avoid crises, and achieve their goals more efficiently.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The idea that attending classes is beneficial for students and provides them with numerous learning opportunities is a commonly held notion. However, there are those who argue that having the option to attend classes allows students to study from home, saving them time and money that would be spent on commuting. Despite this, I firmly believe that attending classes is the wiser choice.Primarily, being present in classes offers students the chance to interact with their peers, which is invaluable for grasping new material. Through discussions and reviews during free time in college, students can better understand the learning materials and assist each other in overcoming challenging concepts. This collaborative learning experience is lost when students opt to study from home, depriving them of the opportunity to seek help from others when faced with difficult problems.Another crucial point to consider is the role of teachers in facilitating learning. Teachers explain concepts thoroughly in class, supplementing their explanations with examples to clarify key points. This not only makes learning easier and faster but also optimizes the study process, reducing the time required to comprehend materials compared to self-study. Thus, attending classes is not a waste of time but rather a catalyst for understanding.Lastly, attending classes instills discipline in students. By adhering to class schedules and disciplines, students practice perseverance in completing assignments. In contrast, those who study from home often lack the structure and discipline needed to maintain a coherent and timely study schedule. This can lead to missed important concepts due to disorganized study habits.Based on the aforementioned points, I am convinced that learning within a peer group setting, facilitated by teachers, is an effective way to absorb learning materials. Moreover, the presence of teachers is pivotal in assisting students, making class attendance a necessity for benefiting from their guidance. Regular class attendance also fosters attentiveness and punctuality in studies, attitudes that are essential for achieving success.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;"The advent of telephones and email has numerous advantages, making communication between individuals significantly easier. In my opinion, these inventions have not made people less personal, as some may suggest. Instead, I firmly believe that they have improved the way we connect with each other. Here are several reasons that support my viewpoint.Firstly, telephones and email have bridged the gap between people who live far apart, enabling them to stay in touch effortlessly. Unlike traditional mail services, which can be unreliable and prone to errors, telephones and email allow for direct and instant communication. For instance, currently residing in the U.S., I can easily keep in touch with my parents who live in my home country. With just a phone call or an email, I can connect with them whenever I want, making me feel closer to them despite the physical distance.Secondly, telephones and email can sometimes be more effective than face-to-face communication, especially when it comes to expressing important or sensitive thoughts. For example, during an argument with friends, I may not be able to articulate my thoughts clearly in the heat of the moment. However, after taking time to reflect, I can use telephones or email to convey my genuine thoughts and feelings without being influenced by emotions. This aspect of telephones and email makes me feel more personal and heard.The ability to directly connect with loved ones and express personal thoughts through these mediums is what makes telephones and email so valuable to me. They have not diminished the personal aspect of communication; rather, they have enhanced it by providing more avenues for expression and connection. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the notion that telephones and email have made communication less personal. On the contrary, they have made it possible for me to feel more connected and understood, even across distances."
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;I strongly prefer living in a large city over residing in the countryside. Big cities offer numerous advantages and facilities that surpass those found in small towns. The environment in which a person grows up plays a significant role in shaping their future, as it influences their personality and cultural development.Big cities boast a wide range of social venues, including restaurants, museums, bars, sports clubs, cinemas, theaters, and more. This provides city dwellers with ample opportunities to enjoy their lives and socialize with friends, unlike those living in small towns who have limited options. In small towns, socializing is often restricted to a single bar or cinema.In terms of education, big cities have a significant edge over small towns, with more experienced and professional teachers. It is undisputable that education plays a vital role in shaping an individual's future, and better education leads to better career prospects and higher pay. Consequently, individuals living in big cities have a greater chance of securing better jobs compared to those residing in small towns. Furthermore, many companies are based in big cities, resulting in a higher number of job opportunities.However, living in a big city comes with its drawbacks, including the sacrifice of a quiet and peaceful life, fresh air, and the loss of time due to traffic and transportation, as distances in big cities can be substantial. While every technology has its benefits and drawbacks, I prefer to have access to modern facilities and technologies, despite their disadvantages, rather than living without them.In addition to the previously mentioned advantages, medical technology is also far superior in big cities. In my opinion, the benefits of medical technology outweigh the negative impacts of technology on human life.In conclusion, I firmly believe that living in a big city is more enjoyable, exciting, and beneficial than living in a small town, due to the numerous social venues, technological facilities, superior education, and medical services.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;It's natural to want to try new things and take risks, even if you're not naturally talented at them. Exploring new experiences and discovering new passions can be beneficial, as it can help you grow as a person and uncover hidden talents. However, this approach may not always yield the desired results, and you may end up missing out on opportunities to excel in areas where you have a natural advantage. For this reason, I firmly believe that focusing on your strengths is the key to achieving success.Concentrating on what you're good at allows you to make progress towards your goals. The more time you invest in your areas of strength, the more likely you are to achieve something remarkable. Take, for example, Albert Einstein, one of the most accomplished physicists in history. He dedicated his life to developing theories in physics, ultimately establishing the groundbreaking concepts of special and general relativity. Notably, he was so focused on his work that he didn't bother with other pursuits, including even the simplest tasks, like distinguishing between different types of soup. This example illustrates the importance of focusing on your strengths in order to achieve your objectives.When you continue to work on what you're already good at, you'll naturally become even better at it. As you experience success and satisfaction, you'll become more engaged and motivated to push yourself further. For instance, I was proficient in math during my junior high school years. My confidence and enjoyment of math encouraged me to tackle more advanced problems, which ultimately enabled me to achieve higher scores on math tests and even solve university-level problems. Therefore, by building on your existing strengths, you'll not only make significant progress but also improve your skills.In conclusion, doing what you're already good at can lead to significant accomplishments and enhanced performance. By focusing on your strengths, you'll be more likely to achieve your goals and make meaningful progress, rather than spreading yourself too thin by trying to master new areas.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;One of the key characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, particularly when it comes to financial matters. The question of how to learn responsibility is a topic of debate, with many people arguing over whether children should be taught financial responsibility from a young age or when they reach adulthood. I firmly believe that children should learn to manage their own money from a young age, and I'd like to outline the reasons why.First and foremost, research by sociologists has shown that our characteristics and personality traits are formed early in life. It is essential to teach children about financial issues as soon as possible. I recall a personal experience from my childhood that illustrates this point. When I was 7 years old, my father gave me a monthly allowance to spend on things I liked. The first time, I spent the entire amount on food at school and quickly ran out of money. When I asked my father for extra funds, he refused, teaching me the importance of managing my expenses. From then on, I learned to be economical and have been able to achieve my goals.Another significant aspect of teaching children to manage their finances is the impact on family finances. If parents provide their children with everything they want, they risk depleting their own savings and compromising their essential needs. Even in wealthy families, failing to teach children to manage their own money can lead to them becoming unappreciative and dependent individuals who rely solely on their parents' prosperity. A friend of mine, from a rich and prosperous family, is a case in point. His parents gave him everything he demanded from a young age, and as a result, he grew up to be an arrogant person who couldn't stand on his own feet and constantly asked for money. Despite his parents' efforts to teach him financial management and career skills, it was too late, and unfortunately, he met a tragic end. One night, while driving recklessly with friends, he crashed into a truck and lost his life. The incident not only caused significant damage to public property but also brought sorrow to his family.Although some argue that children should be free to spend their money as they please, I strongly believe that it is crucial to teach children financial responsibility from a young age. Our personality traits are formed in childhood, and it is challenging to change them in adulthood. By teaching children the value of money and how to manage it responsibly, we can help them develop into mature, financially responsible adults who can achieve their goals and make a positive contribution to society.

The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves.

It is also a vital part of cultural heritage, reflecting the values and beliefs of a community. Many cultures use dance to showcase their prosperity and entertain others.

The atmosphere was joyful, with both the performers and the spectators feeling happy and festive.In conclusion, I strongly agree that dance is a crucial part of culture, as it represents people's beliefs, showcases a culture's civilization, and provides entertainment. Therefore, dance is essential in every culture, bringing people together and promoting joy, unity, and celebration.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;The debate about whether understanding ideas and concepts is more crucial than learning facts for students has sparked intense discussion. While many people argue that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital, I firmly believe that acquiring factual knowledge has more significant advantages for students' future lives. In this essay, I will outline my reasons for this stance.Firstly, when students focus on learning facts in school, they will be better equipped to handle real-life problems after graduation. For instance, having more information about facts enables students to become more acquainted with the practical aspects of life, beyond just theoretical concepts. As a result, they will be more prepared to tackle challenges outside the classroom and solve problems more effectively.Secondly, learning facts improves students' social behavior. Relying solely on theoretical concepts and ideas can limit their understanding of human nature. To develop their analytical skills, students need to grasp concrete facts and objects, rather than just abstract concepts. By engaging with facts, students can better navigate social situations, leading to enhanced social communication in everyday life.Moreover, learning facts helps students develop the ability to manage their fears and concerns. When a student understands a fact and its implications, they can confront it with more confidence. In my opinion, anxieties and concerns can be highly detrimental to one's progress and success. By learning facts, students can build confidence and develop a more positive approach to challenges.In conclusion, I strongly believe that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both their social and individual lives, as supported by the aforementioned reasons. By acquiring factual knowledge, students can enhance their social interactions, tackle problems more effectively, and develop the confidence to succeed in various aspects of life.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The importance of sports and social activities in educational institutions is a topic of ongoing debate, with many arguing that they are secondary to academic subjects. However, I firmly believe that these activities play a vital role in the lives of students, comparable to the significance of academic classes. In this essay, I will outline the reasons behind my stance.Firstly, sports have a profound impact on both physical and mental health. In my opinion, regular physical activity is essential for maintaining overall well-being. For instance, after a week of intensive studying for a difficult exam, I felt drained and depressed. A visit to the gym proved to be an effective remedy, underscoring the necessity of sports for students to regain their energy and health. The physical benefits of sports, such as maintaining a healthy body shape, are complemented by their psychological advantages, making them an indispensable part of student life.Secondly, social activities are crucial for fostering social awareness and behavior, which are essential life skills. These activities prepare students for their future roles in society by familiarizing them with diverse environments and mindsets. Social groups and classes are vital in equipping students with the skills to engage in discussions and navigate real-world social scenarios. Therefore, I believe that social activities deserve equal financial support, as they are fundamental in readying students for their post-graduation lives.Furthermore, sports and social activities contribute significantly to the happiness and enjoyment of students. If studying were the sole focus of student life, it would inevitably lead to boredom and a lack of motivation. These activities provide a platform for students to interact with peers, form new friendships, and garner new experiences, all of which inspire feelings of happiness and excitement. In my view, having more friends and experiencing novel situations are key to a fulfilling student life.In conclusion, I am convinced that sports and social activities should receive comparable attention and funding, given the multitude of benefits they offer students. These activities not only enhance student life during their academic tenure but also positively impact their future. By acknowledging the importance of sports and social activities, educational institutions can provide students with a well-rounded experience that prepares them for all aspects of life.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;"In today's modern society, the internet is widely regarded as one of the most significant inventions of the past century. While some individuals believe that the internet is a source of numerous problems due to the abundance of information available, others argue that it provides a vast amount of valuable information. I firmly agree with the latter, as the internet offers essential daily information, enables people to acquire knowledge, and facilitates exploration of the world.First and foremost, people have a natural desire to stay informed about global events and issues that affect their daily lives. The internet caters to this need by providing easy access to information that can aid in daily life. For instance, a busy businessman who lacks the time to watch television or read newspapers can effortlessly stay updated on news and stock market trends via the internet.Furthermore, the internet serves as a powerful tool for acquiring knowledge. Students, in particular, can leverage online courses and educational videos to learn from the comfort of their own homes. This opportunity for knowledge acquisition is not limited to students; anyone can expand their understanding and gain insight into various subjects. For example, individuals dealing with health issues can research and find valuable information on their conditions.Lastly, the internet has made the world seem smaller, which is a positive development. People who are constrained by time or financial limitations can now virtually travel the world through the internet. They can view numerous photos and videos of fascinating places, and even learn about the cultures and traditions of other countries, thereby broadening their knowledge about different nations.In conclusion, people generally appreciate the internet and often express gratitude for its role in facilitating studying, conducting business, and exploring the world. The valuable information it provides enhances the quality of life, allowing people to enjoy their lives more fully."
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;A university education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their future endeavors. While some institutions require students to specialize in a single subject, others offer a more interdisciplinary approach, allowing students to explore multiple fields of study. In my opinion, studying multiple subjects is preferable to specializing in just one, as it enables students to pursue their interests, gain a broader range of knowledge, and increase their future career opportunities.Upon completing high school, many students are uncertain about which subjects to pursue at the university level, as they are often interested in multiple areas of study. For instance, a student interested in science may also have a passion for music. By requiring students to study multiple subjects, universities can cater to these diverse interests and provide a more well-rounded education.Furthermore, individuals with a broad range of knowledge are often more versatile and skilled than those who specialize in a single area. By studying multiple subjects, students can acquire a deeper understanding of various fields and develop a more nuanced perspective. For example, a business student who also studies history can gain a unique understanding of the global context in which businesses operate. Additionally, studying multiple subjects provides students with valuable experiences, such as interacting with new peers and instructors, which can lead to the exchange of ideas and knowledge.Ultimately, graduates who have completed a variety of courses and gained extensive experience during their university years will have a greater range of career opportunities. With a broad-based education, they can pursue various careers and select a profession that aligns with their interests and salary expectations. Moreover, having a diverse range of knowledge enables individuals to explore multiple career paths and increase their earning potential.In conclusion, studying multiple subjects at university is superior to specializing in a single subject, as it provides students with a broader range of knowledge, increased future opportunities, and a more well-rounded education to apply in their personal and professional lives.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;While advancing technologies to explore the galaxy is intriguing, many people worldwide suffer from poverty and starvation. Therefore, these technological advancements are meaningless if people lack basic prosperity. In my opinion, I concur with the notion that governments should prioritize the fundamental needs of their citizens.Firstly, as evident from the aftermath of the great economic recession, widespread unemployment plagued numerous countries. The lack of financial resources led to increased crime rates in many cities, as people resorted to theft to survive. Consequently, the quality of life deteriorated, resulting in widespread unhappiness. Hence, governments should invest in job creation, enabling people to earn a living without resorting to crime. This, in turn, would lead to a decrease in crime rates and an improvement in the overall quality of life.Secondly, environmental concerns are equally crucial, as every living being depends on a healthy ecosystem. Currently, many industrialized nations continue to emit high levels of carbon dioxide, exacerbating the greenhouse effect and contributing to climate change. This has far-reaching implications for all living creatures. To mitigate this issue, governments should establish regulations to control carbon dioxide emissions and invest in alternative energy sources, such as solar energy, to replace fossil fuels. By preserving a healthy environment, we can ensure a better quality of life.Lastly, the family unit is the foundation of society. When family members lack quality time together, it can lead to problems within the family, which can, in turn, affect the broader society and ultimately, the nation. To address this, governments should launch campaigns to foster love and togetherness within families. For instance, organizing weekly events to bring families together can help them bond and understand one another. When families are strong and harmonious, societies and nations are more likely to thrive.In conclusion, I firmly believe that governments should allocate resources to address the basic needs of their citizens, namely, employment, a healthy environment, and strong family bonds. These three fundamental issues are, in my opinion, the most critical basic needs that governments should prioritize to enhance the quality of life for their people.

282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The notion that teachers should be paid based on their students' grades is not only unfair but also impractical. Every individual is unique, and this diversity is particularly evident in the learning abilities of students within the same education system. Some students are quick to grasp new concepts, while others may need more time and attention. This disparity makes it unjust to evaluate teachers solely on the grades their students achieve.Firstly, the primary responsibility of teachers is to impart knowledge to their students within a specified timeframe. The curriculum is designed to be covered within a certain period, leaving teachers with the daunting task of managing their time effectively to ensure all topics are taught. Given the constraints of time, it becomes impossible for teachers to provide individualized attention to each student. If they were to focus on specific students, it could lead to incomplete coverage of the syllabus, resulting in some students missing out on crucial topics.Secondly, the varying learning abilities among students mean that they comprehend lessons at different paces. While some students may fully understand the topics covered in class, others may struggle, leading to diverse test results. The disparity in test outcomes is more reflective of the students' effort and learning capabilities rather than the teachers' abilities. Therefore, it is not reasonable to tie teachers' pay to their students' test results, as it overlooks the intrinsic differences in how students learn and retain information.Lastly, adopting a payment system based on student grades could lead to significant issues with the quality of education. Teachers might prioritize higher salaries over effective teaching methods, potentially leading to a culture where high grades are awarded leniently to secure better pay, rather than being a genuine reflection of a student's understanding. This could undermine the integrity of the education system and is a scenario that should be avoided. Thus, student grades should not be a factor in evaluating teacher performance.In conclusion, the idea of paying teachers based on how much their students learn is flawed. The impracticality of providing individualized attention to each student, coupled with the differences in learning abilities among students, and the potential for abuse of the grading system, all argue against this payment structure. It is crucial to find more equitable and effective methods to evaluate and compensate teachers, ones that promote the quality of education and do justice to the diverse needs and abilities of both teachers and students.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;When watching movies or dramas, many of us enjoy seeing good characters receive a happy ending and bad characters face punishment. However, some people disagree with this sentiment. Personally, I prefer to see good characters rewarded, but I also believe that it's not realistic or engaging to always have them emerge victorious.If every story ends with a happy ending, it becomes predictable and boring. When good characters always win, it's easy to guess the outcome of the movie or drama, leading to a lack of interest. On the other hand, if good characters don't always succeed, viewers are more invested in finding out what happens next. For instance, many Hollywood stories feature a hero who defeats the villain and gets the girl, but this trope has become tired and overused. Even I have grown weary of seeing the same ending repeatedly, which is why I think it's essential to mix things up and not always reward good characters.In reality, good people often face difficult outcomes, and this occurs more frequently than in movies. If children are only exposed to TV programs where good characters are always rewarded, they may develop unrealistic expectations and believe that being good will always lead to a positive outcome. They may act virtuously solely to receive rewards, and when they discover that this isn't always the case, they may become disillusioned and less inclined to be good. In fact, good people do good deeds regardless of the outcome, and it's essential to convey this message to young children to avoid misunderstandings.While happy endings can be motivating and encourage people to do good things, this effect is often short-lived, as individuals will eventually realize that reality is more complex. Therefore, I suggest that movies and TV programs should depict a range of stories where good characters are sometimes rewarded and sometimes not. This approach will promote a more realistic understanding of the world and encourage people to be good for its own sake, rather than just for a potential reward. Based on these arguments, I believe that movies and TV programs should present diverse stories that reflect the complexity of real life.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;"While distance learning has its advantages, it should not serve as a replacement for traditional classroom learning. Classroom learning provides a more comprehensive learning experience, offering a wealth of information and hands-on experiences that enhance students' understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, learning in a classroom setting is not solely focused on academic skills; it also encompasses the development of essential social skills and the ability to solve problems in real-world situations. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the idea of substituting online courses for regular classes and will provide several reasons to support my viewpoint.First and foremost, classroom learning offers a richer learning experience, facilitating deeper comprehension of the subjects being taught. This is largely due to the array of equipment and resources available in classrooms that can demonstrate real-life examples. For instance, in biology classes, learning anatomy through dissecting frogs provides invaluable hands-on experience. Students learn how to use various tools and observe actual organs, an experience that significantly surpasses the limitations of textbook learning in online classes.Secondly, online classes lack the capability to provide the same level of social skills education as traditional classroom settings. In a classroom, teachers often assign group projects that foster collaboration among students, teaching them how to interact, work together, and solve problems as a team. These crucial social and teamwork skills are difficult to replicate in an online learning environment.Lastly, traditional classroom learning promotes a healthier lifestyle for students. Schools typically offer physical education classes, led by specialist trainers who teach students the correct techniques for exercising, thereby reducing the risk of injury. This structured approach to physical activity is a significant advantage over self-directed exercise at home, which may lead to improper form and potential harm. Thus, classroom learning environments contribute to the overall health and well-being of students in ways that online learning cannot.In conclusion, I firmly believe that traditional classroom learning should not be replaced by online courses. Classrooms offer tangible, real-world examples that enhance subject comprehension, provide indispensable social skills, and promote physical health through structured exercise programs. Overall, the benefits of classroom learning are multifaceted, offering students a wide range of skills and experiences that are essential for their development and success."

There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself.

This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;Numerous experiences have profoundly impacted my perspective and transformed the way I approach life. These experiences have improved my life in various ways, enabling me to enhance my problem-solving skills, prioritize my health, and plan for my future. I will elaborate on the reasons that support my opinion.To begin with, my university education has taught me to be a more prudent and methodical person when tackling problems. For instance, in mathematics classes, I learned to break down complex problems into manageable steps, starting with identifying the root cause and conducting research to find solutions. I have successfully applied this approach to real-life situations, such as navigating to a destination. By analyzing the most efficient routes and time-consuming options, I can make informed decisions. This experience has equipped me with better problem-solving skills.Furthermore, certain experiences have taught me the importance of self-care and health awareness. For example, reading and listening to news about healthy diets has led me to prioritize purchasing high-quality, organic food that is free from harmful chemicals. This conscious decision has contributed to my overall well-being and heightened my awareness of the significance of maintaining good health.Lastly, experiences have also influenced my approach to planning for my future. Reading about the benefits of saving for retirement, for instance, has prompted me to reassess my spending habits and adopt a more frugal mindset. Instead of indulging in impulse purchases, I have started saving for my long-term goals. This experience has instilled in me a sense of responsibility and foresight, enabling me to make informed decisions about my future.In conclusion, the experiences that have shaped my thinking and approach to life have been instrumental in my personal growth. I have developed more effective problem-solving strategies, become more health-conscious, and acquired the habit of planning for my future. These experiences have collectively contributed to my transformation into a more responsible and aware individual, empowering me to lead a more fulfilling and purposeful life.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;In today's globalized world, proficiency in a foreign language has become increasingly important. As a result, many individuals are pursuing language studies. When it comes to learning a foreign language, there are two primary options: studying in one's home country or traveling to a country where the language is spoken. In my opinion, studying abroad is the better choice, and I will provide reasons to support this viewpoint.Firstly, immersing oneself in a foreign language environment is an effective way to stimulate language learning. For instance, when surrounded by people who speak the language, one is compelled to improve their communication skills in order to interact with others. Even everyday tasks, such as buying food, require language proficiency, which motivates individuals to develop their skills quickly. This environment fosters a desire to learn and improve, making language acquisition more efficient.Secondly, making friends who speak the language is a significant factor in accelerating language proficiency. For example, attending an English language school abroad, I was surrounded by people from diverse linguistic backgrounds, and English became the common language for communication. This allowed me to practice speaking with my friends without fear of making mistakes, leading to faster progress in language development.In conclusion, I firmly believe that learning a language in a foreign country is superior to studying in one's home country. The necessity to communicate with others, combined with the opportunity to engage in conversations with friends, makes language learning more effective. Overall, studying abroad is the better choice for language acquisition, and I highly recommend it to those seeking to improve their language skills.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;When considering a place to live, public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors that we take into account. However, it's challenging to find a community that perfectly meets our needs. In my hometown, we have almost all the necessary public utilities, except for reliable transportation. This is the one aspect I would like to see changed, particularly given the daily traffic congestion I face, which seems to be worsening.Firstly, I believe we need more alternatives for public transportation, such as subway trains or sky trains. This would provide people with more options for getting around, unlike the current situation where buses are the only available mode of public transportation. With a subway or sky train, people would have more convenience and flexibility, including the ability to estimate travel times based on fixed schedules, which is not possible with buses. Additionally, this improvement would indirectly reduce traffic congestion on the roads.Secondly, the bus system in my community is limited to only two routes, which is a significant problem. For instance, if I want to go somewhere that's not on one of these routes, I have to take a bus to the central station first and then transfer to another bus, which is a waste of time. Increasing the number of routes would make transportation much easier for everyone.Lastly, having more types of public transportation would encourage people to use their own cars less often, which comes with several benefits. For example, people could save money on gasoline, which is becoming increasingly expensive. Moreover, reduced car usage would help conserve energy resources. In summary, transportation is a fundamental factor that directly affects people's quality of life. I hope that one day, the transportation issues in my hometown will be addressed, making it easier and more convenient for everyone in the community to get around.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;Soliciting opinions from multiple sources can enhance people's performance, and evaluating teachers from a student's perspective is a valuable way to improve the quality of the educational system. Not only can teachers boost their performance, but the entire education system can also benefit from evaluations made by students. Therefore, I concur with the notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To start with, student evaluations can lead to improved teacher performance. For instance, student feedback is akin to customer feedback that business owners need to receive in order to enhance their products. Students may complain that their teachers speak too quickly, making it difficult for them to grasp the information. As a result, teachers can adapt by speaking more slowly, ensuring that students can absorb the information being presented. Thus, student evaluations can lead to enhanced teacher performance.Moreover, student evaluations can also contribute to improved school quality. When teachers augment their performance, the overall quality of the school increases. For example, companies like Microsoft produce exceptional products because they employ high-performing individuals. Similarly, schools can produce intellectually capable students by assembling a team of teachers who continually improve their craft through student evaluations.Ultimately, students stand to gain the most from these evaluations. By studying under experienced and high-performing teachers, students can easily comprehend complex subjects. As teachers continually adapt their teaching methods to facilitate student understanding, students can graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their future endeavors.In conclusion, I firmly believe that schools should solicit student evaluations of their teachers. This practice can lead to improved teacher performance, enhanced school quality, and better student outcomes. By leveraging student feedback, educational institutions can create a more effective and efficient learning environment, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders involved.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;Companies come in various sizes, ranging from small to large, depending on their specific context, achievements, and needs. While small companies typically operate locally, large companies function on an international scale, catering to the needs of an entire nation or even multiple foreign countries. Personally, I have a strong preference for working with a large company, and my reasons are multifaceted.Firstly, securing a job in a large company is significantly easier compared to finding employment in a smaller one. Large corporations are continually on the lookout for skilled personnel to manage, distribute, and sell their products across different countries. For instance, when a large company decides to establish a branch in a foreign country, it would require additional employees in that country to oversee operations. Essentially, the larger the company, the greater the job opportunities.Secondly, I believe that large companies are better positioned to offer higher salaries than their smaller counterparts. The success of a large company is a testament to its financial stability, which in turn, enables it to provide its employees with more competitive salaries. It stands to reason that a renowned, internationally recognized company would offer salaries that surpass those of a small, local business.Thirdly, my passion for traveling is another reason I prefer large companies. Given their international reputation, large companies often host global conferences, meetings, and workshops. These events not only provide me with the opportunity to travel to different countries but also to network with new people and acquire new skills in my field.In conclusion, I firmly believe that I would prefer working for a large company over a small one. My preference is based on several key factors, including better job prospects, more competitive salaries, and the opportunity to travel globally to attend international conferences. These aspects make working for a large company a more appealing and rewarding experience for me.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;It is undeniable that knowledge is the most valuable asset for individuals, and colleges and universities play a vital role in providing academic skills that enable people to achieve their goals. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether access to higher education should be reserved for top-performing students or made available to all. This issue will be examined in this discussion.On one hand, many argue that colleges and universities should only consider admitting students who demonstrate academic excellence. The reasoning behind this is that pursuing higher education is a significant financial investment, and institutions do not want to waste resources on students who may not be adequately prepared. Proponents of this view believe that only high-achieving students have the potential to succeed in advanced programs, leaving mediocre students without opportunities to acquire advanced knowledge from these institutions.On the other hand, some argue that all students should have equal access to higher education. Although higher education requires substantial financial and time commitments, it is believed that even moderate students should be given a chance to pursue their goals. Ambition and dedication can drive individuals to succeed, regardless of their initial academic standing, as people have the capacity to grow and change. A supportive college or university environment can motivate students to work harder towards a brighter future. Therefore, it is argued that mediocre students should also have the opportunity to be educated in colleges and universities.In conclusion, personally, I agree that colleges and universities should be accessible to all students who wish to pursue their goals. This would provide students with the opportunity to learn, practice, and gain valuable knowledge for their careers and future. Access to higher education is a precious opportunity that should be available to all students, as it has the potential to unlock their full potential and contribute to their personal and professional growth.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The idea that children should be prohibited from playing computer games because it is a waste of time is a topic of debate. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.Firstly, it has been observed that a significant number of students are addicted to online computer games, which negatively impacts their academic performance. A study conducted by Beijing University found that 80% of students who failed their final exams spent two hours or more playing online games every week, whereas 90% of excellent students reported not playing computer games on most days. Additionally, recent research by scientists suggests that young people are more prone to becoming engrossed in these games due to their limited self-control.Secondly, computer games offer little to no educational value, making the time spent on them a waste. Since most games are developed for commercial purposes and aim to attract children's attention, they often feature themes of war, violence, blood, or sex. These subjects are not only unsuitable for children but can also have detrimental effects on their development.Although some students who spend considerable time playing computer games may eventually pursue careers related to the industry, it is essential to acknowledge that the majority of students who engage in excessive gaming suffer negative consequences. They sacrifice time that could be spent on studying, sleeping, or physical exercise to play these games. It is not uncommon to find teenagers staying awake for several days playing online games at internet cafes, and there have been reported cases of teenagers suffering sudden death due to excessive gaming.In conclusion, I firmly believe that children should not be allowed to play computer games. Like cigarettes, which are regulated to protect adults, computer games require regulatory measures to safeguard children's well-being.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;When considering whether classmates or colleagues should collaborate on projects in person or via email, I firmly believe that working in person is the preferred approach. This is because face-to-face interaction facilitates effective communication, which is essential for successful project outcomes.Firstly, team members often have diverse perspectives, and in-person discussions enable them to efficiently reach a unified opinion. Face-to-face meetings are far more effective than email exchanges for resolving differences and reaching agreements. A study conducted by Beijing University illustrates this point. The researchers divided participants into two groups, asking one to discuss an activity's budget in person and the other to do so via email. The results showed that the in-person group reached an agreement in just 30 minutes, whereas the email group took 30 hours to achieve the same goal. Similar experiments by other scientists have yielded comparable results, demonstrating that direct conversation enables rapid agreement.Secondly, in-person collaboration indirectly enhances the quality and efficiency of projects by minimizing conflicts among team members. Emailing about informal matters can inadvertently formalize them, making recipients feel uneasy or even offended by the written words. In contrast, discussing the same topics in person tends to put all parties at ease, as responses are not recorded and are less likely to be misinterpreted as official claims. This reduction in misunderstandings leads to fewer conflicts, fostering better communication among team members.Admittedly, there are situations where email is necessary, such as when team members are geographically dispersed. Although emails are not ideal for collaborative work, they are better than no communication at all. Given that most classroom or campus projects involve members who are relatively proximate, the need for email-based collaboration is minimized.Moreover, projects often require extensive coordination, and relying on email for every opinion and update would result in an overwhelming volume of messages, making the process inefficient. In conclusion, I strongly prefer in-person collaboration over email-based work for projects, as it promotes efficiency, understanding, and ultimately, better outcomes.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;In recent years, an increasing number of university professors have become involved in scientific research. This trend has sparked concerns that the quality of education may suffer as a result, with some arguing that professors should focus more on teaching. However, based on my experiences, I firmly believe that professors should be encouraged to prioritize research.Firstly, engaging in research is a vital means of self-improvement for professors. Universities can be relatively isolated environments, and research projects provide a conduit to the outside world. Moreover, conducting research enables professors to stay abreast of the latest developments in modern technologies. I recall my professor's involvement in several research projects during my college days, which earned him a reputation and invitations to speak at other universities, despite our institution not being highly ranked. Research projects serve as a window to the broader world, offering unparalleled opportunities for growth and recognition.Secondly, professors should fully leverage the research-friendly environment provided by universities. State-of-the-art laboratories and a concentration of talented individuals make universities an ideal setting for research. It is unreasonable to discourage professors from utilizing these advantages, given the potential for groundbreaking discoveries. The example of Einstein, who developed the theory of general relativity while a professor at the University of Berlin, illustrates the significant role universities play in facilitating professors' success.Lastly, research can also enhance teaching quality. By involving students in research projects, professors can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. I still remember my experience as an assistant on one of my professor's research projects, which allowed me to apply textbook theories to real-life experiments. Research projects offer a more effective teaching method, enabling students to grasp complex concepts and develop valuable skills.In conclusion, it is only natural to support professors in dedicating more time to research. By doing so, they can extend their own professional development, and the outcomes of their research will ultimately benefit society as a whole.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;Everyone learns in their own unique way, which they believe is the most effective for them. Learning on one's own has its advantages, as it allows for focused concentration without distractions, leading to more in-depth learning. Additionally, learning with a teacher can be more demanding due to the homework assignments they provide. Nevertheless, I prefer learning with a teacher to self-study.Firstly, the notable advantage of learning with a teacher is the ability to ask questions and clarify doubts. When encountering difficulties in our studies, seeking guidance from a teacher is an efficient way to resolve the issue promptly. Teachers possess extensive experience and knowledge, and are skilled at helping students understand complex concepts. They often share insights that are not readily available in textbooks or online resources. In my class, I frequently discuss problems with my teacher to find a comprehensive solution, and my classmates also actively engage with the teacher.Secondly, I believe that learning with a teacher is more efficient than self-study. With a teacher's guidance, we can complete assignments more quickly and accurately. Moreover, teachers play a vital role in guiding us in the right direction, providing opportunities for significant educational growth and improvement. This, in turn, enhances our knowledge and understanding.Finally, learning without a teacher has its drawbacks. A significant limitation is that when faced with complex difficulties, self-study may lead to frustration and disappointment if one's efforts to understand the material are unsuccessful. I think that relying solely on oneself for learning can hinder the development of important skills like cooperation and effective communication. Therefore, I support the idea that learning with a teacher is superior.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;While many individuals believe they are fortunate to live in an era of advanced technology, it's essential to acknowledge that these innovations have also introduced complexities into our lives. On one hand, technology has undoubtedly made various tasks more convenient and accessible. For instance, renewing a driver's license or sending money no longer requires physical visits to the DMV or bank, a convenience that would likely astonish ancient civilizations, making us seem like magicians to them. However, despite these advantages, there are compelling reasons to suggest that technology has also complicated our lives.Firstly, the rapid pace of technological advancements can be overwhelming. New devices and features are introduced almost daily, leaving many people struggling to keep up. Even with enthusiasm for new technology, there's a learning curve that can be daunting. For example, using a new iPhone, which I personally find impressive, has been a challenging experience. Despite having it for a couple of months, I still haven't mastered all its features. The initial attempt to go through all the instructions was soon abandoned due to the time-consuming nature of the process and the sheer volume of information to digest.Furthermore, technology has had a detrimental impact on language. The rise of computers and cellphones has led to the creation of a new, abbreviated form of communication. In an effort to type as quickly as one speaks, individuals resort to using broken language and numerous abbreviations, a trend exacerbated by social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace. This phenomenon is particularly concerning when considering its influence on young minds. My younger brother, for instance, often communicates in terms I've never heard of and struggles with basic spelling, a situation I've attempted to correct, only to be perceived as overly conservative.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly provided us with a more convenient lifestyle, it has also introduced chaos into our lives. The reasons mentioned above, including the challenges of adapting to new technologies and the erosion of language, highlight the complexities that technology has brought upon us. Therefore, it's crucial to approach the era of high technology with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both its benefits and its drawbacks.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The debate about whether distance learning and online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning has sparked intense discussion, with some people strongly advocating for the former and others vehemently opposing this idea. Personally, I firmly believe that online classes should not supersede classroom learning. My reasoning is outlined below.Firstly, classroom learning stands out as the superior method of education compared to online classes. The classroom environment fosters a unique learning experience, where students can draw inspiration and motivation from their peers. Witnessing a classmate perform exceptionally well can encourage personal improvement. For instance, during my first year of Bachelor of Commerce, observing friends who achieved higher grades motivated me to enhance my performance, ultimately leading to me securing the first rank in the final examination.Secondly, classroom learning necessitates completing study work within established timelines, honing time management skills. Furthermore, participating in group studies within a classroom setting teaches invaluable communication and teamwork skills. These skills are crucial for future success and career advancement. The structured environment of a classroom ensures that students learn to prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and collaborate effectively with peers.Thirdly, professors play a pivotal role in classroom learning, often being specialists in their subjects. They provide valuable information, practical skills, and individualized attention. Under their guidance, students can clarify doubts through face-to-face interactions, leading to quicker learning outcomes. My personal experience illustrates this point. Initially, I relied on online courses for TOEFL IBT coaching, but after a month, I realized the limitations and joined an institute. The significant improvement in my English skills within just a month underscored the superiority of classroom learning.While it is undeniable that online classes offer certain advantages, they are best utilized as supplementary tools rather than as a replacement for traditional classroom learning. The conclusion drawn from the aforementioned points is that classroom learning remains the most effective method of education. Its multifaceted benefits, ranging from peer motivation and improved time management to expert instruction and enhanced communication skills, cement its position as the preferred mode of learning.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";When we refer to students, we typically mean boys and girls who attend school or college. In some countries, teenagers have the opportunity to take on part-time jobs in addition to their studies. However, not everyone supports the idea of teenagers balancing work and academics. In my opinion, I believe it is beneficial for teenagers to have a part-time job while still in school, and I have two main reasons for this stance.The primary reason is that part-time jobs offer students a chance to learn valuable skills before entering the workforce. Through these experiences, students can develop essential skills such as time management, financial management, and effective communication. For instance, during my high school years, I worked as a salesperson in a shop for a year. This experience taught me how to manage my time efficiently, juggling my job responsibilities with my homework and academic commitments. I also learned how to manage money by handling the shop's accounts when my boss was absent. This experience demonstrated that part-time jobs can be a valuable learning opportunity for students.Another significant reason is that part-time jobs enable students to earn money, which can help alleviate financial burdens on their parents. For example, when I was in high school, I worked as a home tutor, teaching mathematics to two of my neighbor's children. By doing so, I earned some money, which I used to purchase books and other essential items. Moreover, taking on this part-time job allowed me to become more financially independent, reducing my reliance on my parents for pocket money. As evident, part-time jobs can provide students with a means to earn money and contribute to their family's financial well-being.In conclusion, while some people may argue that part-time jobs can distract students from their academic responsibilities, my personal experience suggests otherwise. Having had a part-time job during my high school years did not negatively impact my academic performance. In fact, I believe it helped me prepare more effectively for my future. Therefore, I strongly advocate for students to consider taking on part-time jobs alongside their studies, as it can be a valuable and enriching experience that sets them up for success.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;In our diverse world, where numerous cultures coexist, each with its unique language, acquiring a foreign language has become a vital skill. Interacting with people from other countries is inevitable, and learning a foreign language not only enhances one's interactions but also expands their skill set. I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in one's own country is the most practical approach, and the following paragraphs will elucidate the reasons behind this opinion.Firstly, traveling to a foreign country to learn a language is not feasible for everyone due to the significant financial burden and complex legal procedures involved. In the past, finding a teacher to guide through the learning process of a foreign language was challenging. However, with globalization, the landscape has changed, and it is now relatively easy to find a language teacher within one's own country. For instance, in the Indian subcontinent, numerous language training centers have emerged, offering courses in languages such as French and German.Secondly, educational institutions have incorporated foreign language courses into their curricula, making it accessible for students to choose from a variety of languages. This development has simplified the process of learning a foreign language domestically. Furthermore, highly qualified teachers specializing in foreign languages are readily available in schools and colleges, providing expert guidance.Thirdly, technology has bridged the gap in learning a foreign language within one's own country. The internet offers a plethora of foreign language courses, and various online forums provide platforms for individuals to discuss and resolve challenges related to different languages.In conclusion, learning a foreign language in one's own country is the most advantageous approach. It is cost-effective and leverages the plethora of opportunities now available, making it an achievable and beneficial endeavor for all.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;Everyone needs a break from their hectic schedules, and students are no exception. They require a vacation from their intense academic schedules to recharge and refocus. While some people advocate for a single, long vacation, others prefer multiple short breaks throughout the year, allowing students to periodically rejuvenate and relieve themselves. In my opinion, several small breaks are more beneficial for students, as they help maintain academic enthusiasm and productivity.Firstly, having multiple vacations throughout the year helps keep students' stress levels low. Educational institutions often schedule short vacations after term exams, providing relief from exam pressure. Research conducted by universities has shown that students' performance improves when they receive regular breaks from their learning, preparation, and examination schedules. Many colleges abroad offer vacations after each semester, enabling students to unwind, prepare for the next semester, and gather necessary materials, such as books and reference texts. These breaks also give students the opportunity to earn and manage funds for their upcoming courses.Secondly, scientific research has provided numerous authentic surveys demonstrating the positive impact of breaks on students' performance. Studies have shown that students' learning capabilities increase after a refreshing vacation. For instance, in my school, we would receive several vacations after our quarterly exams. During these breaks, I would analyze my performance in the latest examination, revisit questions or concepts I struggled with, and develop new skills or hobbies. I would also miss my school and return with renewed enthusiasm, leading to improved academic performance and better marks in the new quarter.Vacations are not only essential for students but also for professionals and homemakers. They provide a break from regular commitments, allowing individuals to focus on themselves, heal from stress, and boost their desire to resume their schedules. Therefore, schools should consider incorporating multiple short vacations into the academic year, as this approach can help students maintain their academic motivation and achieve better results.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"As I pushed through the exhaustion, my heart screamed ""Keep running!"" but my legs felt like lead. I was 20 kilometers into the 2014 marathon tournament, and I saw some people giving up while others fought to the finish line. At times, my body begged me to stop, but I made the conscious decision to keep going. And it paid off - I won a medal at the age of nearly thirty. This experience taught me that perseverance is key to achieving our goals.Firstly, committing to our goals helps us discover our personal worth. When I decided to train hard, I uncovered the true potential of my body and mind. Even if I hadn't won the medal, I would have still been proud of my accomplishment, knowing that I had pushed my tired legs to their limits.Secondly, learning to overcome difficulties makes us stronger. I remembered the first round of the tournament, where I finished last. However, I didn't give up, and instead, I used that experience to improve myself for the next round. Having lost a thousand times before my first win, I learned to channel my suffering into strength.Thirdly, there are times when the responsibility to our goals feels overwhelming. But I believe that this responsibility is worth shouldering. When the distance seems insurmountable, a runner who pushes beyond their limits will feel an overwhelming sense of pride. They will taste the sweetness of triumph, knowing that they didn't give up on their goal.For these reasons, I firmly believe that one should never give up. The true reward lies not in the achievement itself, but in the dignity that comes with it. Anyone striving to reach their goal should recognize that their effort and experience, including the struggles and setbacks, will help them understand their true potential, increase their strength, and ultimately prepare them to overcome even greater challenges in life."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;In recent years, many developed countries have struggled with low savings rates, as individuals often opt to spend their earnings immediately or even take out loans to cover expenses. However, isn't it wiser to set aside money for future investments or unforeseen difficulties? In my opinion, saving a portion of one's earnings is crucial, given the unpredictability of future events in both professional and personal life. Having savings allows individuals to achieve their goals and navigate life's uncertainties.Firstly, professional futures are filled with uncertainties. The current global economic conditions are challenging, with numerous unpredictable factors making it essential to have a financial safety net. For instance, I recall friends who lost their jobs due to the European economic crisis, with some having no personal savings to fall back on. As a result, they were forced to move back in with their families, sacrificing their independence.Moreover, personal life is also subject to unforeseen developments. It is possible that individuals may encounter unavoidable expenses in the future, which they cannot afford without prior savings. I remember a university friend who had minimal savings and was faced with a major car repair. Unable to afford the maintenance, he was forced to sell the vehicle.Lastly, saving enables individuals to indulge in luxuries and fulfill their aspirations. Working hard and saving for future investments can be incredibly rewarding, providing a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. For example, my girlfriend and I embarked on a month-long backpacking trip through Southeast Asia last summer, a long-held dream that we were able to realize thanks to our savings.Considering these arguments, I firmly believe that saving money is not only a prudent choice but a necessary one. By setting aside a portion of one's earnings, individuals can navigate life's uncertainties, achieve their goals, and enjoy the fruits of their labor. Ultimately, saving is essential for securing a stable and fulfilling future.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;The pace of life has accelerated dramatically over the past few decades, courtesy of modern technologies and globalization. While many individuals have adapted to this fast-paced lifestyle, others have chosen to downshift and savor each moment. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it's essential to weigh both the benefits and drawbacks of this accelerated lifestyle and ponder which approach is superior. In my view, embracing a slower pace of life is crucial, as living in a state of perpetual hurry is accompanied by numerous disadvantages.Firstly, living life in the fast lane is incredibly stressful and can have detrimental effects on one's health. If one is always in a rush and fails to take regular breaks, their body will react to the strain of their lifestyle. Many hardworking individuals suffer from ailments like burn-out syndrome, as their bodies are unable to sustain the pace. For instance, my father experienced a breakdown several years ago due to the stress of his job. After taking several weeks off, his body recovered, and he has since reduced the tempo of his lifestyle, with positive results.Additionally, adopting a slower pace of life enhances one's happiness. Excessive stress can hinder one's ability to nurture relationships with loved ones. By avoiding hurry, one can allocate more time to family and friends, thereby fostering a sense of community and social connection. This, in turn, boosts happiness and decreases stress levels. A friend of mine, who has chosen a slower pace of life, attests to its satisfaction, as he can now cherish time with his family and cultivate his friendships.Lastly, quality requires time and effort. When faced with challenging tasks, rushing through them increases the likelihood of committing avoidable errors or mistakes. Hasty completion of tasks may result in overlooking crucial aspects or opportunities. Consequently, mistakes may be made that could have been avoided with more patience. For example, I once wrote an essay in haste and received a poor grade due to mistakes that I could have avoided with more careful consideration.In conclusion, given the arguments presented, it's clear that living a slower life offers numerous advantages, including improved health, heightened happiness, and enhanced quality of work. By embracing a more relaxed pace, individuals can reap these benefits and enjoy a more fulfilling life.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;Over the past few centuries, the global population has experienced steady growth, and for the first time in history, it has surpassed seven billion. As a result, natural habitats have been increasingly destroyed to make way for housing, agriculture, and industry. However, it is crucial that we preserve the land to maintain the well-being of other species that inhabit our planet. In my opinion, it is imperative that we alter our attitude towards the environment for several compelling reasons.Firstly, preserving natural diversity is essential for future generations. If we fail to change our behavior, we risk driving numerous species that have lived on the planet for millions of years to extinction. By destroying natural habitats such as forests, jungles, and lakes to make room for industry and farmland, we are disrupting the delicate balance of the ecosystem. For instance, a significant portion of the South American Rainforest is destroyed daily to provide wood and farmland, putting endangered animals at risk of losing their natural habitat and facing extinction. Consequently, future generations will be denied the opportunity to observe and study these species.Furthermore, a stable and sustainable environment is vital for maintaining favorable weather conditions. Our actions are causing pollution, which severely impacts the weather on Earth and contributes to undeniable global warming. This not only affects endangered animals but also humans, as we are susceptible to the rising sea levels and climatic changes. According to recent studies by the United Nations Organization, the sea level is projected to increase by over one meter on average by 2050, which will drastically impact coastal communities and alter the global climate.In conclusion, it is clear that, given the arguments presented, we must change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve endangered species but also to safeguard our own living conditions. It is our responsibility to adopt a more sustainable and environmentally conscious approach to ensure a livable future for all inhabitants of the planet.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The debate about whether university students should be required to attend classes has sparked a variety of opinions among students. While some believe that attendance should be mandatory, others think it should be optional. In my opinion, given the level of maturity that university students have attained, they should have the freedom to choose whether or not to attend classes. Therefore, I strongly advocate for making class attendance optional for students.To start with, attending classes can sometimes be a waste of time. For example, some lecturers simply read from the textbook for a particular course module without providing additional explanations or insights, making the exercise redundant. University students, having reached a level of maturity, are capable of reading and understanding textbooks on their own. Moreover, with the advent of modern technology, students can access a wealth of information from various sources, including the internet, where they can find articles, e-books, and video tutorials that present information in a more engaging and clearer manner. However, it's worth noting that some lecturers deliver lectures in a highly informative and engaging way, making attendance valuable and worthwhile.Furthermore, university schedules often allocate entire days to lectures, which can be challenging for students who balance their academic commitments with part-time jobs to manage their expenses. These working students need to juggle lecture time, study time, and work hours. Instead of attending lectures that may not add significant value, students could use this time to participate in other university activities such as debate competitions, sports events, and more, which provide opportunities to meet fellow students and build relationships.In summary, although some lecturers deliver highly informative and engaging lectures, others may not, potentially boring students and wasting their time. University students, having matured both mentally and physically, possess the discernment to choose how they wish to allocate their time. Therefore, offering the option to choose which classes to attend would likely yield more benefits than drawbacks, as it allows students to make the most of their time in a way that is tailored to their individual needs and learning styles.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;In today's world, people are constantly faced with the question of whether technology simplifies their lives or not, leaving them perplexed. While some argue that technology complicates their lives, many others believe it makes their lives easier. Although I acknowledge that technology can add complexity to certain aspects of life, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In this essay, I will elaborate on my perspective.Firstly, in the realm of transportation, it is undeniable that technological advancements in the automotive industry have made people's lives significantly simpler. With a private vehicle, traveling to another city is as easy as sitting back and enjoying the ride. Furthermore, air travel has reduced the time it takes to travel across oceans to just a few hours, a feat that was unimaginable in ancient times.Secondly, technology has also simplified the teaching process. In the past, teachers would spend a considerable amount of time writing on chalkboards, resulting in wasted time and teacher fatigue. However, with the advent of iPads and e-learning, traditional paper books and blackboards have become obsolete. All the necessary knowledge and information are now stored on these devices, accessible with just a single click, making learning more efficient.Admittedly, technology can complicate people's lives to some extent. For instance, cell phones, which were initially used solely for communication, now play a more complex role in social interactions. People feel pressured to constantly check their social media accounts, such as Facebook, Twitter, and forums, adding unnecessary stress to their lives. Moreover, mobile games can be highly addictive, particularly among teenagers, leading to phone addiction and a more complicated life.In conclusion, based on the factors mentioned above, it can be inferred that although technology may add complexity to certain aspects of life, the convenience and simplicity it brings to people's lives are substantial. Overall, the benefits of technology outweigh its drawbacks, making life easier and more convenient for individuals.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";"The role of mass media in reporting on celebrity lives is a contentious issue. While some argue that media outlets should focus solely on news and current events, others believe that entertainment, including coverage of famous individuals' lives, is also essential. In my opinion, a closer examination of the issue reveals that mass media often prioritize superficial content over substance, and this is due to several factors.One key reason is that media outlets, such as television stations and newspapers, emphasize celebrity news to boost their viewership or readership. The proliferation of tabloid journalism and reality TV has led to a decline in quality reporting, with many outlets opting for sensationalized stories over in-depth coverage of important issues. The internet has democratized access to information, rendering the traditional role of mass media as gatekeepers of information obsolete. Instead, their primary goal has shifted to attracting and maintaining a sizable audience.Another factor contributing to the media's fixation on celebrity lives is the societal obsession with appearance and gossip. The constant pursuit of celebrities by paparazzi, who often go to extreme lengths to capture intrusive photos, exemplifies this phenomenon. Furthermore, newspapers and magazines have been accused of engaging in ""checkbook journalism,"" where they pay hefty sums for exclusive stories or photos, fueling the public's appetite for salacious content. The rise of reality TV shows, such as ""Big Brother,"" which places individuals in artificial situations for the sake of entertainment, also reflects this trend.In conclusion, it is evident that television, magazines, and newspapers devote excessive attention to celebrities' private lives, driven by the desire to increase audience share and cater to a society that thrives on sensationalized content. This prioritization of celebrity news over substantive reporting is a result of the media's shift towards entertainment and the public's insatiable appetite for gossip and spectacle."
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;"While many people may prefer to live in different places at various times due to factors such as career advancement, housing, community, and more, I have a strong preference for spending my entire life in one place - my hometown. The reasons for this are numerous, starting with the vast number of friends and good relationships I've cultivated here. I also have a deep affection for the local traffic, which is remarkably manageable, and the environment, which is truly wonderful.Born and raised in this small town, I've developed a strong network of friendships. My friends and I often spend our free time engaging in sports like soccer and basketball, and we always have a great time. One of the standout features of my town is the close-knit community; everyone knows each other, and we maintain excellent relationships. The spirit of neighborliness is alive and well here, with people readily helping each other in times of need. I've yet to find another place that replicates this sense of community and camaraderie.Another significant reason I wish to remain here is my love for the local traffic system. The town is designed with large streets but a minimal number of cars, making movement easy and efficient. This contrasts sharply with my recent experience in the city center, where I had to wait for an hour just to reach my friend's house due to crowded traffic conditions.Additionally, the environment in my hometown is a major draw for me. Through my travels to other places, even if only for short stays, I've come to appreciate the cleanliness and freshness of my hometown's environment. In contrast, other places I've visited, often overcrowded with people, struggle to maintain cleanliness and freshness.In conclusion, I firmly believe that residing in one place, particularly one's hometown, offers a superior quality of life compared to constantly moving between different locations. While moving around can indeed provide a plethora of experiences, living in one's hometown fosters a deep sense of comfort and familiarity with the traffic, the people, and most importantly, the environment. This rootedness and sense of belonging are invaluable to me, making my decision to stay in my hometown a clear and confident choice."
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;The decision on where to live after completing high school is a daunting task for many students, who often find themselves torn between two primary options: residing in an apartment or in university dormitories. In my opinion, both choices come with their unique set of advantages and disadvantages.On one hand, living in a dormitory offers students the opportunity to immerse themselves in the university's academic environment. For example, it provides access to various extracurricular activities on campus, such as conversation clubs and sports teams, which can be incredibly enriching. Additionally, dormitory life facilitates greater interaction with both teachers and classmates, which can be particularly beneficial when facing academic challenges. If a student is struggling with a math problem, they can easily seek help from roommates, classmates, or teachers. Overall, I believe that living in a dormitory is highly beneficial for students.On the other hand, living off campus is a valuable preparation for real life. It teaches students essential life skills such as responsibility, independence, punctuality, and cooperation, which may not be fully developed in a dormitory setting. Students living in apartments must manage their responsibilities, including paying rent on time and handling utility bills, all while maintaining their academic performance. This setting also provides an opportunity for students to engage with their community, interact with people from diverse backgrounds, and develop social skills that are crucial for life after graduation.Given these points, it's clear that both living arrangements have their benefits, making the decision challenging for students. Personally, I would opt for the second option: living in an apartment. I believe it offers a comprehensive learning experience that teaches valuable life characteristics necessary for leading a successful life. These skills, such as responsibility and independence, are essential and will undoubtedly benefit me in the long run.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;In today's fast-paced work environment, organizations are on the lookout for individuals who can work efficiently and effectively. These individuals play a crucial role in enhancing a company's productivity. Working quickly and carefully is considered an ideal approach, and I strongly agree with this statement for several reasons. My reasons for endorsing this approach include the opportunity to acquire new skills, the necessity of working multiple jobs to make ends meet, and the ability to handle a heavier workload.Firstly, when individuals work rapidly, they have more opportunities to learn and develop their skills. Attending classes or workshops that focus on improving employee skills can be a highly effective way to enhance productivity. By learning how to work efficiently, individuals can excel in their workplace. For instance, a friend of mine who used to work slowly was at risk of being fired by his boss. However, after attending a course that taught him how to work quickly, he was able to turn his performance around and is now a valued employee.Moreover, the increasing cost of living has led many people to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. If they only worked at one organization, they would not be able to earn a sufficient income. This reality forces them to work faster and more efficiently. For example, I am working two jobs to earn a higher salary, which is necessary to fund my plans to study abroad. The more money I earn, the more opportunities I have.Lastly, individuals who work slowly often struggle to handle multiple tasks. On the other hand, those who can work quickly and efficiently are more likely to be assigned additional responsibilities by their bosses. If they complete these tasks efficiently, they are likely to receive recognition and encouragement from their superiors, which motivates them to work even harder. This, in turn, helps them develop the skill of working without hesitation, which is highly valued in the workplace. Furthermore, this approach can lead to career advancement and higher earning potential.In conclusion, I fully endorse the statement that people should work faster, even if it means taking on more risk. The benefits of acquiring new skills, working multiple jobs, and handling a heavier workload outweigh the drawbacks. I hope that more people will develop this skill, as it will ultimately lead to greater productivity and success in their careers.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;Over the past decade, the burden on university students has been continually increasing. Some people believe that students should not be allowed to attend classes until they have passed the prerequisite exams. Others argue that students can attend university courses without first passing the exams. In my opinion, students can acquire university knowledge without having to pass an exam as a prerequisite. There are several reasons that support this perspective.Firstly, students are not always experts in every aspect of a subject. For instance, I am passionate about physics, but I have never been fond of electronics because it is not always applicable to the real world. As a result, I have struggled with electronics and scored poorly on exams. However, I have consistently achieved high scores in other areas of physics. If I were not allowed to attend classes until I passed the electronics exam, I would have been unable to progress in the physics course and would have likely failed the exam repeatedly. Fortunately, my university allows students to attend classes regardless of their exam scores, enabling me to study physics without being held back by my weaknesses in electronics. Ultimately, I was able to retake the electronics exam and pass it.Secondly, if universities were to adopt a policy that prohibits students from attending classes without first passing the exams, many students would likely become disengaged. If a student fails most of their exams, they would be unable to participate in most classes, leaving them with nothing to do on campus. This could lead to a decline in academic achievement, as students might spend their time playing online games instead of focusing on their studies. Eventually, such a student might become disheartened and struggle to succeed in the world. This outcome would be a failure not only of the university but also of the entire education system.It is true that allowing students to participate in classes without first passing the exams might not lead to the highest academic achievement. However, the benefits of providing students with unrestricted access to classes outweigh the potential drawbacks of lower grades.In conclusion, universities should allow students to participate in classes without first passing the exams. This approach recognizes that students are not always experts in every aspect of a subject and helps to prevent students from becoming disengaged and falling behind in their studies.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;University education is a crucial part of one's life, which is why it's always a topic of discussion. The question is, what's the best way to support students? Is raising professors' salaries the answer? I don't think so. While professors are essential, the primary purpose of schools is to serve students. Therefore, funds should be allocated to improve school facilities and update resources, which benefit the students, rather than just the instructors.In my opinion, schools should prioritize students over professors. The most effective way to enhance education is to encourage active learning among students. By renovating school facilities, students will be more inclined to spend time on campus working on assignments. A comfortable environment can foster longer stays, leading to a productive learning cycle. When students have a better environment to work on their assignments, the quality of their work improves, and healthy competition among peers is promoted. Unfortunately, the classrooms at my university are outdated and uninviting, making me prefer to study at a coffee shop instead. However, coffee shops can be distracting, leading to rushed and subpar work.The ultimate goal is to motivate students to improve. Spending more money to raise professors' salaries is not an effective way to achieve this. Moreover, will the university assess all professors to ensure they deserve a salary increase? Some professors may not be worthy of the extra compensation, making it pointless to allocate funds to them. Higher salaries do not necessarily translate to better teaching or more effort from instructors. In fact, there was a proposal in my country to raise professors' salaries, which sparked a student-led protest advocating against the move. The fact that the protest occurred suggests that the policy was not well-supported.At the end of the day, students are the priority at school. Their tuition fees are not only meant to compensate professors but also to ensure they receive a quality education. This is why I believe that providing more funds to professors is not the best use of students' tuition fees. Students should be the ones to benefit from their tuition payments.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;The importance of pets in our society cannot be overstated. While cats and dogs are the most popular pets, many people also keep birds, tortoises, and fish as companions. There is an ongoing debate about how pets should be treated, with some arguing that they should be considered part of the family, while others view them as simply animals that lack the capacity for human-like thought. In my opinion, pets deserve to be treated with the same respect and care as human beings, and for good reason.First and foremost, pets serve as loyal friends, providing companionship and emotional support in much the same way that human friends do. They are always there for us, offering a listening ear when we need it, and often proving to be more attentive than some people. I can speak to this from personal experience. When I was 14, I lost my uncle and felt lost and alone. Talking to my friends didn't help, as none of them could understand my grief. But my dog was there for me, and somehow, he seemed to sense my deep emotional pain. Although pets can't speak, they have a unique ability to understand and comfort us in times of need.Furthermore, pets have a multitude of practical uses. Pet therapy, for example, is becoming increasingly popular, with research showing that pets can have a positive impact on a range of illnesses. Trained dogs assist blind individuals, enabling them to navigate the world independently. Pets also play a vital role in supporting people with depression, as their presence can help alleviate symptoms. Additionally, dogs are trained to aid in law enforcement, using their keen sense of smell to detect criminals or narcotics.In conclusion, I firmly believe that pets warrant treatment as family members, given their role as loyal friends and their numerous practical applications. Their capacity to provide comfort, support, and assistance in various situations makes them invaluable companions, and it is only right that we treat them with the respect, care, and kindness they deserve.
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;The world we live in today is inherently unpredictable, and a single groundbreaking invention can upend all our existing notions. To keep up with the rapid pace of modern development, most of us strive to move at an equally fast pace. While I believe that adapting to this fast pace is a wise decision to stay relevant in today's world, I also think it may not be the most beneficial approach for our society as a whole.First and foremost, even in a fast-paced world, accuracy remains a crucial element. This is evident even in simple, everyday tasks like homework, which require precision to be done correctly. Rushing through work by taking the risk of making mistakes is essentially pointless, as it only serves to complete the task on time without actually putting in any genuine effort or learning. What we should focus on improving is our capability to produce quality work, rather than just aiming to complete tasks quickly. Although it may take longer to review our work multiple times to ensure accuracy, consistent effort will eventually allow us to increase our work speed without compromising on quality.Secondly, aside from accuracy, the world also values efficiency, which encompasses both completing tasks in minimal time and meeting high-quality standards. Even if we manage to keep up with the pace by overlooking project details and only focusing on the general framework, this approach will not satisfy companies and clients in the long run. Eventually, we will be left behind despite keeping up with the pace, because when problems arise, we will have to go back and correct the mistakes made, which can be more costly and time-consuming than doing the work neatly from the start.Moreover, looking at this issue from a broader perspective, some types of work cannot tolerate any mistakes whatsoever. For instance, in official missions like those conducted by NASA, a tiny mistake can have catastrophic consequences. A miscalculation in launching a rocket's orbit can lead to the failure of an entire project worth trillions of dollars. In such high-stakes scenarios, even the desire to finish quickly cannot compromise the meticulous attention to every detail of the mission, as overlooking any part can trigger a multitude of problems.In conclusion, while keeping up with the world's pace is necessary, it is equally important for us to be extraordinarily cautious and meticulous. Rough or sloppy work is intolerable if we aim to remain competitive, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that combines speed with accuracy and quality.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;The continuous advancements in technology and economy in the modern world have created significant disparities between cities, which is evident in the vast size differences between them. These cities range from metropolises with over 20 million inhabitants to small towns with only a few hundred residents. This diversity in urban settings has led to a wider range of preferences for people's living choices. Personally, I prefer residing in larger cities over smaller ones, and this inclination stems from various factors.Firstly, I find the vibrancy of big cities appealing, as living in a dynamic environment can lead to a rich and transformative experience that refines one's personality and broadens their perspective on the world. Life in big cities presents new challenges daily, whether it's deciding on a restaurant to dine at or choosing a company to work for. I find this lifestyle highly attractive and consider it a significant advantage of big cities compared to the slow-paced and monotonous lifestyle of small towns.Another aspect that gives big cities an edge over small towns is the array of facilities and services they offer, which enhance and support the quality of life for their inhabitants. Hospitals and advanced medical facilities provide a sense of medical security, while cultural events like exhibitions and theater plays enrich one's life and expand their horizons - opportunities that are often lacking in small towns.Moreover, it's undeniable that a country's economic power is largely driven by its big cities, where the majority of wealth and finance is concentrated and controlled. This economic clout enables big cities to offer more opportunities for career advancement and higher income prospects compared to small towns, and a higher income can be the foundation of a happier, healthier life.Lastly, while I prefer living in a big city, I acknowledge that this is a matter of personal preference. I must admit that I would love to spend some time in the countryside to rejuvenate and relieve myself from the stresses of daily life.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";The issue of housing scarcity has become increasingly prominent in recent years, with the cost of accommodation continually rising. In light of this, the need for government financial assistance is paramount. When allocating resources, the government's primary consideration should be the construction of new buildings, rather than the preservation of historic and traditional ones.Building more accommodations is essential to meeting people's basic needs. Without a decent place to live, citizens cannot lead a harmonious life. The continuous growth in housing prices threatens to make comfortable living a luxury exclusive to the wealthy, leaving the middle and lower classes struggling. This, in turn, may force ordinary people, particularly the younger generation, into a cycle of working solely to pay housing bills, leading to increased dissatisfaction with the government. The perpetual fear of losing their accommodation will also hinder their productivity. It is the government's responsibility to invest in its people and rescue them from this predicament, as a government that truly represents its citizens is the one that will endure, fostering a sense of community and cohesion.Furthermore, new building construction warrants greater governmental investment due to its requirement for vast resources compared to the preservation of old buildings. Constructing a new building involves several prerequisites, including land sold through formal government procedures, a reliable construction company, and a significant amount of labor. Hundreds of challenges will inevitably arise during the construction process, making it a task that only the government, with its substantial resources and effectiveness, can adequately manage.In conclusion, I firmly believe that new building construction has a rightful claim to more government funding. This investment is crucial not only for addressing the immediate housing needs but also for ensuring the long-term stability and satisfaction of the population, which are foundational to a thriving and cohesive society.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I wholeheartedly concur with the notion that life's challenges are a crucial part of our growth, a viewpoint substantiated by the fact that every difficult experience serves as a catalyst for skill-building, enhanced decision-making, and increased adaptability. The process of learning from adversity is exemplified in the way infants acquire fundamental survival skills during their formative years. As they navigate the challenges of daily life, such as walking and eating, they are, in effect, learning invaluable lessons that will benefit them throughout their lives. For instance, the process of learning to walk involves numerous stumbles and setbacks, but with each attempt, they refine their technique until they ultimately master the skill.Similarly, the foundation of innovation and experimentation is rooted in a multitude of trials and errors. It is rare for a scientist to achieve success on their inaugural attempt. Instead, they typically undergo a series of tests and experiments, refining their approach with each iteration. The oft-cited example of Thomas Edison, who reportedly tested over 10,000 light bulbs before inventing the successful model, illustrates this point. Although his initial experiments were likely fraught with difficulty and frustration, Edison persisted, leveraging each failure as an opportunity to discover new findings and eventually break through to a groundbreaking invention.Furthermore, our experiences, particularly the challenging ones, have a profound impact on our personal growth, fortifying our resolve and emotional resilience. When reflecting on past difficulties, we often find that they have instilled in us a deeper sense of confidence and self-assurance. A personal anecdote that comes to mind is my transition to college hostel life after school. The initial days were overwhelming, given that it was my first time away from my parents and living among unfamiliar faces. I felt vulnerable and emotionally disoriented, but as time passed, I began to adapt to my new surroundings, forging connections with my roommates and expanding my social circle. This experience significantly enhanced my communication and social skills, demonstrating the transformative power of adversity.In conclusion, my stance on this statement is that every life experience, be it positive or negative, offers a valuable lesson or takeaway. While positive experiences provide us with cherished memories, negative ones equip us with essential life lessons. This dichotomy underscores the importance of embracing all experiences, regardless of their nature, as each contributes uniquely to our personal and skill development, ultimately enriching our lives in profound ways.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The industrialization and urbanization that began in the late 18th century led to a significant increase in the number of automobiles on the road. However, the fuel that powers these vehicles, oil, has become a major contributor to pollution in urban environments. While some critics argue that drivers should be charged an extra fee for driving during rush hour due to the pollution and congestion they cause, I disagree. The principles of capitalism grant individuals the right to own property, including cars, and to use them as they see fit. Although driving during rush hour may contribute to pollution, laws permit it, and therefore, imposing an additional fee on drivers may be seen as beyond the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities. Moreover, traffic congestion is an inevitable phenomenon that cannot be entirely avoided or banned, and thus, it is not solely within drivers' control. It is unfair to penalize drivers solely for operating their vehicles during a specific time. Similarly, soldiers fighting for their countries in wars should not be blamed for the conflict itself.The cost of purchasing and maintaining a car is already prohibitively expensive for many families, with hundreds of thousands spent on the initial purchase and subsequent fees. Imposing an additional fee on drivers would be unreasonable and excessive. Most families acquire cars for safer and more convenient transportation, and excessive fees would add to their financial burden and potentially infringe upon their rights.Rather than simply imposing another fee on drivers, the government should take a more proactive approach by promoting the use of more efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources or redesigning urban layouts to facilitate easier, less polluting travel. Often, traffic congestion arises from factors such as malfunctioning traffic lights or poorly planned roadways, situations in which the city planner, not the driver, should be held accountable. Charging drivers fees without considering the root causes of the problem can be seen as irrational and potentially unlawful.In conclusion, rush hour congestion is often not a direct result of drivers' actions. The true causes of traffic jams can be attributed to various factors, and therefore, charging drivers an additional fee for this purpose can be deemed unreasonable and unjustified.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";The gap between school life and societal expectations is growing wider, making it essential for students to adapt quickly to the real world. To achieve this, parents should encourage their children to take on part-time jobs. There are several reasons that support this viewpoint.Firstly, universities often lack opportunities for students to learn about adult life, as they primarily interact with fellow students. In contrast, part-time jobs provide a platform for students to work with diverse groups of people, mostly adults, who can impart valuable lessons about adult life. For instance, my friend Lisa, who currently holds a part-time job, finds it incredibly beneficial. Through her job, she has made friends from various walks of life, gaining insight into different aspects of adult life. Initially, Lisa believed that work was the core of adult life, but after interacting with her friends, she realized that responsibility is the true foundation of adult life. Thanks to the information shared by her new friends, Lisa is now more confident about her future.Secondly, parents often warn students that adult life is far more demanding than school life. However, without experiencing it firsthand, it's challenging for students to fully comprehend the intensity of adult life. Part-time jobs can bridge this gap, teaching students about the realities of adult life. In fact, some surveys suggest that students who have held part-time jobs are better equipped to manage their time, prepare for their future, and have more realistic expectations compared to those who haven't had similar experiences. Consequently, part-time jobs can provide a deeper understanding of what to expect in the future.Thirdly, some parents worry that part-time jobs might negatively impact their child's studies. Nevertheless, most students undertake part-time jobs during their holidays, which doesn't interfere with their academic schedule. Compared to spending holidays playing video games or using computers, taking on a part-time job is a more productive and beneficial way for students to spend their break.In conclusion, engaging in part-time jobs allows students to experience and understand the realities of adult life. Therefore, parents should support and encourage their children to take on part-time jobs, as it prepares them for the challenges and responsibilities of adulthood.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";"The level of achievement in one's studies is influenced by a multitude of factors, with the pattern of work being a significant one. When it comes to studying, individuals often prefer either collaborative work within a team or solo effort. Personally, I lean towards the latter for several compelling reasons.Firstly, my temperament plays a crucial role in this preference. As a natural introvert, I require considerable time and effort to adjust to new environments and people. This was evident when I once had to work on a presentation with unfamiliar individuals; instead of attempting to get acquainted with them, I opted to work independently, completing more than half of the task on my own. This experience showed me that my productivity increases substantially when my work style aligns with my temperament.Moreover, working alone enables me to bypass the time and effort invested in aspects inherent to teamwork, such as delegating tasks, sharing responsibilities and benefits, and engaging in team-building activities. These benefits are particularly noteworthy in situations where time is scarce. For instance, I participated in a student brainstorming competition about a year ago, and to the surprise of my competitors, I emerged victorious as a solo participant.In conclusion, from my perspective, both my temperament and the advantages of individual work serve as the most convincing arguments in favor of studying alone. This method not only enhances my productivity but also allows for a more efficient use of time, leading to better academic outcomes."
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;While many individuals prefer to work for an employer due to the perceived security and comfort it provides, such as a stable salary and fewer worries about taxes, sales, and other entrepreneurial challenges, I personally would prefer to be my own boss. My reasons for this preference are as follows.First and foremost, time is the most valuable resource I have, and having my own business allows me to manage it effectively. As my own boss, I have the freedom to work at my own pace, take time off when I please, and travel without needing to justify my schedule to anyone. I can also put in extra hours to increase my earnings, giving me a sense of autonomy and flexibility. For me, the ability to be self-employed is synonymous with freedom.Additionally, earning a good income is a fundamental motivator for most people when choosing a career path. The amount of money one earns is often the top consideration. When working for someone else, I feel that my ideas and skills are undervalued and undercompensated. As a result, my salary has never increased significantly, limiting my financial growth. In contrast, having my own business enables me to capitalize on my creativity and innovative ideas, allowing me to earn more money and achieve financial stability.In conclusion, despite the fact that many people are hesitant to venture out on their own, I am drawn to the idea of running my own business, which would grant me control over my time and the potential to earn a higher income based on my unique ideas and hard work.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";It is crucial for cities to undergo urban renewal by replacing outdated buildings with new ones, but this process should exclude historic buildings. These structures hold significant cultural and historical value, serving as a window into the past and providing insight into the lives of our ancestors. They attract tourists, foster the development of tourism industries, and offer a unique opportunity for visitors to learn about the history and culture of a city.Historic buildings are invaluable resources that provide answers to questions about our collective past, shedding light on the mysteries of previous generations. They showcase the architectural knowledge, lifestyle, and survival strategies of people who lived thousands of years ago. By examining their structures, we can gain a deeper understanding of the architectural expertise of our ancestors. Moreover, historic buildings are treasured repositories of knowledge, offering valuable lessons about the past and its cultural significance.One of the significant advantages of preserving historic buildings is their ability to draw tourists, thereby boosting local economies. Many people are fascinated by the prospect of learning about ancient civilizations and ways of life. This presents a valuable opportunity for cities with historic buildings to showcase their heritage to new visitors. The presence of historic buildings can also stimulate the growth of related industries, such as restaurants, food establishments, handicraft shops, and other cultural venues.In conclusion, preserving historic buildings is essential for several reasons. Not only do they offer financial benefits by fostering the development of tourism and related industries, but they also serve as symbols of national heritage, embodying the historical culture and traditions of our ancestors. It is our responsibility to protect and conserve these invaluable assets for future generations, ensuring that the historical and cultural significance of our cities remains intact.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;Learning is a lifelong process, and receiving the best education, in addition to our ability to self-study, heavily relies on our teachers. Many people argue that parents are the most effective teachers, and I completely agree with this viewpoint for the following reasons.First and foremost, parents are our initial teachers from a very early age. From birth, they instruct us in fundamental skills such as smiling, walking, and basic routines like eating. As we grow older, they share numerous fairy tales and essential ethical lessons that have a lasting impact on our lives.Secondly, while we learn more complex subjects like science and language at school, our parents continue to educate us outside of the classroom. In my opinion, we spend a significant amount of time at home with our families, surpassing the time spent at school. Although we may forget certain school lessons if we don't apply them in real-life situations, I firmly believe that the lessons our parents teach us will stay with us forever, as we utilize them daily. For instance, the importance of gratitude towards those who help us, as taught by my parents, is a lesson I will never forget.Thirdly, I strongly believe that parents' unconditional love for their children enables them to provide guidance and support throughout our lives. Even as we mature, get married, and start our own families, our parents remain a constant source of wisdom, helping us distinguish right from wrong. My older brother, who has been living independently for two years, still seeks advice from our parents when faced with challenges in his career or personal life.In conclusion, I firmly believe that parents are indeed our best teachers, providing us with invaluable lessons and guidance that shape us into the individuals we become.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";"In my family, the most debated topic between my parents is my father's career change. Five years ago, he left his 20-year job as an architectural engineer to become a landscape painter. Whenever I ask him why, he responds seriously, ""I'm done doing the same work for 20 years, and I really want to try something different, that's all."" While many people might think this decision is ridiculous, arguing that doing the same task is the essence of a job, I side with my father.Most workers adapt to doing the same tasks, which allows them to achieve more. For instance, my mother, a renowned dentist in our province, has worked for 25 years. Similarly, Gandhi dedicated his life to fighting against the British-ruled government and inspiring civil rights movements in India, eventually becoming the father of the nation.

324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;"The rapid growth of the economy has brought the debate about the essential qualities of a good worker into the spotlight. Many people argue that the ability to adapt to a new environment is crucial, as it is a fundamental communication skill for new employees. However, from my perspective, there is only one factor that truly benefits a company and sets a worker apart: possessing in-depth knowledge of their job. I firmly believe that excellent job knowledge is the most significant attribute.Admittedly, adapting to a new environment is an important aspect of any job, as it facilitates communication and cooperation with colleagues. Nevertheless, I would argue that working independently and mastering one's craft is a more long-term and valuable skill. While adapting to a new environment may be necessary for new employees, excellent job knowledge will continue to benefit them throughout their career.Companies greatly benefit from employees with excellent job knowledge. The most innovative and profitable technologies are often developed by workers with in-depth expertise, rather than those with exceptional communication skills. Similarly, a company's reputation and popularity are often built by skilled workers in public relations who effectively promote the company. As a result, companies can earn more revenue and recognition from employees with excellent knowledge.Employees who pursue excellent job knowledge are also likely to be rewarded for their hard work. Throughout our academic careers, from undergraduate to graduate studies, we strive to acquire knowledge and experience that we can apply to our jobs. As an old Chinese scholar once said, ""The essence of study is to utilize it."" After securing a job, our continued pursuit of knowledge is driven not by a desire to impress our managers or adapt to the company culture, but by a desire to master our craft and become exceptional in our field. Ultimately, this dedication to excellence will earn us a sense of pride and recognition.In conclusion, while adapting to a new environment is a valuable skill, I firmly believe that excellent job knowledge is more important. Not only does it benefit our employers, but it also brings personal rewards and recognition. By prioritizing the development of our job knowledge, we can set ourselves up for long-term success and make a meaningful contribution to our companies."
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers in the last century has revolutionized our way of life. While some individuals, particularly the younger generation, tend to overuse computers, leading to increased stress levels, the benefits of computers to our lives are undeniable. In my opinion, computers play a vital and indispensable role in the economic, business, and social spheres of our society. They have also simplified our daily lives by automating routine tasks.It is acknowledged that the integration of computers in various industries has diminished the role of humans. Currently, computers can oversee and execute tasks that were previously performed by humans. Many industries utilize computers to control robots, which undertake tasks that were once carried out by humans. For instance, the production of cars is largely automated, with computers controlling robots that perform various tasks. Furthermore, car manufacturers use computers to simulate and analyze car accidents. Despite the numerous advantages, the advent of computers has led to job losses. The adoption of new technologies and computers has resulted in significant layoffs across various industries.Computers have a profound impact on both social and personal life. They have facilitated global connectivity among people, enabling easy communication through personal messages. Teenagers and adolescents often spend their free time using computers. Moreover, computers provide effortless access to essential information. However, excessive computer use has its drawbacks. Research indicates that teenagers addicted to computer games exhibit more violent and stressful behavior. Prolonged computer use can also lead to health issues, such as knee-related problems.Considering all aspects, the benefits of computers outweigh the drawbacks. The introduction of computers has greatly benefited people's lives, making difficult tasks more manageable and simplifying daily life. Overall, computers have had a profoundly positive impact on our lives, and their continued use is likely to bring about further improvements and conveniences.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;Acquiring a foreign language is essential for children to enhance their learning capabilities. The debate about whether children should begin learning a foreign language at the onset of their schooling is a contentious issue. However, I firmly believe that students should initiate foreign language learning as soon as they start school. This not only improves their cognitive abilities and memory but also broadens their understanding of other cultures and countries.Firstly, the capacity for learning during childhood is more pronounced than at any other stage of life. Consequently, students at the beginning of their educational journey can absorb and learn a foreign language more quickly and effortlessly compared to older learners. They can easily grasp the language structure and vocabulary, and the retention of knowledge acquired during childhood is notably higher than at other life stages. Considering the lack of responsibilities and distractions that older individuals face, it becomes evident that childhood is the optimal time for language acquisition.Moreover, learning a foreign language greatly enhances students' comprehension of global events and cultures. It enables them to understand and appreciate the customs and traditions of other countries, fostering a sense of empowerment to communicate more effectively with peers worldwide. Possessing knowledge of foreign languages and cultures expands a child's perspective, contributing to the development of their personality and self-reliance.In conclusion, the difference between a child who speaks two languages and one who only speaks their native language is palpable, particularly in terms of communication skills, academic understanding, and overall development. This disparity underscores the importance of introducing foreign language learning at the outset of a child's education, highlighting the numerous benefits that accrue from this early exposure.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;In today's society, women and men need each other, even from a young age, including in school. While some experts argue that co-educational schools can hinder academic performance, others see it as a beneficial way to foster understanding and recognition between the sexes. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together, as it provides them with the opportunity to get to know each other and learn how to interact with the opposite sex.School is a microcosm of society, preparing students for future life. By attending the same school, students can learn to view members of the opposite sex as friends and classmates. Moreover, boys will learn how to communicate effectively with girls in various situations, and vice versa. They will develop essential social skills, such as cooperation, teamwork, and effective communication. As they study together and support each other, they will gain valuable experience that will serve them well as they mature. On the other hand, some experts believe that attending a co-educational school can have drawbacks. They argue that it may lead to distractions, outdoor relationships, and potentially even romantic or sexual relationships, which can divert attention away from academic pursuits.However, attending a school with both boys and girls can also have numerous benefits. It can motivate students to perform better academically, as they will strive to demonstrate their capabilities and abilities in class. Boys and girls will try to outdo each other, which will increase the overall productivity of the class. In conclusion, attending a co-educational school can bring numerous advantages. Participating in study groups will boost students' motivation to study, and they will gain valuable experience interacting with the opposite sex, preparing them for adult life, where they will likely work and live together.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The phrase ""the biggest risk is not taking any risk"" encapsulates the essence of pursuing one's dreams. For those with grand aspirations, bravery and the willingness to embrace new experiences are paramount. While meticulous planning does not guarantee success, and taking risks may lead to unforeseen outcomes, the act of taking chances and believing in one's vision is crucial. It is through assuming new opportunities and accumulating diverse experiences that life's true richness is discovered.Undoubtedly, life is replete with challenges, especially when one ventures into the unknown. However, the outcomes can be profoundly rewarding. Consider individuals who leave behind the familiarity of their jobs, families, and friends to embark on a journey to a foreign land, unaware of what the future holds. Initially, adapting to this new environment and uncovering opportunities can be daunting. Yet, after persevering through the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving their desires, it becomes possible to not only attain their goals but also to lay the foundations of a new life in this unfamiliar territory.Fear of failure and the reluctance to take risks are common hurdles that many face. While frustration is a possible companion on this journey, it is imperative to remain steadfast in the pursuit of one's dreams. The illustrious career of Walt Disney serves as a compelling example. Despite facing numerous rejections, including those of his iconic creations like Mickey Mouse and the Three Little Pigs, and even being fired with the damning criticism that he lacked imagination, Disney never relinquished his aspirations. His determination in the face of adversity is a testament to the rewards of unwavering dedication.In conclusion, thriving in this competitive world demands fearlessness and an openness to new situations. Even when the comfort of routine beckons, it is indispensable to muster the courage to take risks, differentiate oneself, and chase one's dreams. This audacity is the cornerstone of a successful and fulfilling life, where the act of embracing challenges and pursuing one's passions, despite the risks, leads to personal growth, unexpected opportunities, and the realization of one's deepest aspirations."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";It is essential for people to occasionally engage in activities they do not enjoy, as this is an inherent part of life. These tasks may be small or significant, but ultimately, people must accept them, as they often revolve around responsibilities. Furthermore, undertaking unpleasant tasks can help individuals learn and grow. This essay will explore the reasons why I agree that people should sometimes do things they do not enjoy.Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks they do not enjoy. In their personal lives, individuals have responsibilities towards others, and it is rare to find someone who enjoys all of these responsibilities. For instance, I find household chores to be particularly challenging, despite my husband's help. Although I do not enjoy these tasks, I recognize that they are my responsibility and must be completed.Secondly, professional lives are also filled with necessary tasks that may not be enjoyable. Few people enjoy attending boring conferences or working with colleagues they do not get along with. As a research assistant at a university, I have experienced this firsthand. Our university has a professor who struggles with interpersonal relationships, and most assistants do not enjoy discussing their work with him. Nevertheless, we must still interact with him and seek his expertise.Thirdly, engaging in activities one does not enjoy can surprisingly lead to enjoyment. Sometimes, people may be persuaded by friends to participate in an activity they would not normally consider. For example, a friend encouraged my husband and me to join a dance course, which we were initially hesitant about. However, after some persuasion, we decided to attend, and to our surprise, we had a really enjoyable time. We continued with the course for six months, even after most of our friends had dropped out after a month.In conclusion, nobody's life is filled with constant fun and enjoyment. There are inevitably unpleasant and boring parts that nobody likes, but most of these are related to responsibilities that are an integral part of an individual's life.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;"The city of my birth, once renowned for its exquisite antique beauty, was characterized by numerous ancient structures that surrounded it. Sadly, the relentless tide of urbanization has relegated my appreciation of these classic buildings to mere photographs and museum exhibits. To prevent the erosion of our historic heritage, some citizens propose that the government allocate funds to preserve these edifices. In my opinion, it is our collective responsibility to take all necessary measures to safeguard these structures, ensuring that future generations can still marvel at them. The following reasons and examples serve to illustrate my perspective.Historic buildings possess inherent value, as they are potent symbols of a city's identity. These structures serve as testaments to a city's rich cultural tapestry and complexity. By witnessing historic buildings, whether they are associated with famous events or exhibit dramatic architecture, individuals can gain insight into the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For instance, the mere mention of Beijing, China's capital city, instantly conjures images of the Forbidden City, an iconic landmark that embodies the city's, and indeed the nation's, history. The study of the Forbidden City has provided researchers with a comprehensive understanding of China's history and culture.Moreover, historic buildings add a touch of vibrancy to our lives, offering citizens tranquil oases to unwind and rejuvenate. Modern cities, with their plethora of high-rises and crowded streets, often leave little room for relaxation. In contrast, the warmth and character of historic buildings, with their heart pine, marble, or old brick facades, evoke a sense of inner peace. Whether lounging beneath the roof of a historic building or sitting at a desk steeped in history, one can easily forget life's minor annoyances and bask in serenity.Furthermore, historic buildings can generate significant revenue through tourism. Iconic structures like the Forbidden City and the Shanghai Art Museum attract tens of thousands of visitors, thereby supporting themselves financially. This self-sustaining model can be emulated by other cities, yielding efficient economic outcomes that would delight governments. In conclusion, my ideal city is one that harmoniously blends history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way process; once a historic site is lost, it can never be recreated. This sobering reality underscores the importance of identifying and preserving historic buildings. Consequently, I firmly believe that governments should invest in the preservation of these structures, thereby ensuring their legacy for generations to come."
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;As young people mature, they often seek greater independence and desire to live on their own. However, the question of when it's appropriate for young adults to leave their parents' home and start living independently is a topic of debate. In my opinion, I think it's beneficial for young adults to live with their parents for an extended period.Living on one's own requires significant financial responsibility. At a younger age, individuals are less likely to secure high-paying jobs, making it challenging to cover expenses such as rent, food, utilities, and other necessities. Therefore, I believe that living with parents is a prudent decision for young adults until they establish a stable career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period is the strengthened emotional bond between them. Parents offer valuable guidance and advice as their children navigate the challenges of adulthood. Living together fosters an environment where young adults can openly discuss their physiological and psychological changes with their parents. If they move out and live on their own, they may feel hesitant to discuss such issues, thereby missing out on their parents' valuable insights.Some critics may argue that living with parents restricts young adults' freedom. Nevertheless, I believe that many young adults are prone to taking unnecessary risks with the freedom they have. It's actually beneficial if living with parents limits their freedom to engage in destructive behaviors like partying all night, smoking, or using drugs.In essence, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own when they're confident in their ability to sustain themselves financially. It's unwise to sacrifice the opportunity to live with parents for a longer period in exchange for fleeting experiences like late-night parties or substance use. To navigate the challenges of adulthood, manage financial struggles, and stay focused on their goals, it's essential for young adults to live with their parents for an extended period.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The world has shrunk to the size of a small village in recent times. Over the past century, technological advancements have drastically changed the way people communicate, sparking a heated debate about whether this shift is beneficial or detrimental. From my perspective, I firmly believe that this development has been overwhelmingly positive, despite some notable drawbacks.First and foremost, technology has made it easier than ever to stay in touch with loved ones who live far away. The communication revolution has made it possible to accomplish almost everything without face-to-face interaction. With the help of software like Skype, MSN, and Whatsapp, we can connect with anyone, anytime. For instance, in the past, people were hesitant to travel to distant places due to the risk of getting lost. This highlights the significant positive impact of technological development.Moreover, communication tools have simplified the process of making new friends. Statistics show that 40% of people have met their life partners online, demonstrating the internet's role as a fundamental tool for maintaining old relationships and forging new ones.On the other hand, there is a downside to relying on internet or phone communication, as it can limit our ability to fully express our thoughts and emotions. Misinterpretations can occur when our words are taken out of context, leading to an increase in divorce rates.In conclusion, I reiterate my stance that the development of technology has had a profoundly positive impact on the way people communicate, making it more convenient and accessible. Despite some drawbacks, the benefits of technological advancements in communication far outweigh the costs.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The debate about whether the use of machines brings numerous advantages to society is a pressing concern for many individuals. In my opinion, while utilizing machines has several benefits, it is crucial that we do not overlook their negative consequences.Undoubtedly, machines offer many advantages. Firstly, machines are more efficient than humans, as they do not require rest, enabling them to work continuously and produce high-quality products without errors. Additionally, the use of machines can help companies save money, as they do not demand salaries, overtime pay, or pensions, thereby reducing employers' expenditure on employee welfare. The only requirement is for some technicians to ensure machines are functioning correctly and replace parts when necessary.However, the drawbacks of machines should not be disregarded. Primarily, the widespread use of machines has led to significant job losses, particularly in countries with large populations, where high unemployment rates can lead to crime and social instability. Furthermore, machine usage poses serious environmental concerns, including pollution and energy wastage. For instance, the use of dishwashing machines, which consume at least twice the amount of water and electricity as hand washing, can result in substantial waste if thousands of households rely on them.In conclusion, although machines play a vital role in our daily lives and work, the problems they pose should also receive due attention. It is essential to strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of machine usage to ensure that their use is sustainable and responsible.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;Over the years, scientists have been continually discovering remarkable devices in the field of information technology, such as interactive boards, multicore computers, laptops, tablets with incredible resolution, and mobile phones that possess the power of a computer. While the World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive aspects of information technology, there are also some negative consequences to consider.On the one hand, the benefits of IT are numerous. For instance, connecting people through email is both easy and fast. Moreover, the World Wide Web provides humanity with rapid access to information, allowing individuals to find what they need to know in under 10 seconds. These are just a couple of the advantages that make IT so useful.Furthermore, technology is rapidly integrating into our society, with scientists developing innovations like robots that assist people in solving their problems, as well as inventing coffee machines, engines with integrated computers, and more. For example, before centuries, there were no washing machines that could clean clothes while a person worked on another task, showcasing how IT has improved daily life.On the other hand, there are drawbacks to this technological advancement. Some scientists fear that one day, people will face challenges in controlling their own developments, such as robots, which could potentially try to dominate the Earth. This raises concerns about the long-term implications of IT discoveries.In conclusion, while acknowledging the benefits, I agree that IT discoveries may have more disadvantages than advantages. Therefore, it is crucial for people to understand how to properly utilize these technological developments to avoid potential negative outcomes.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The modern era has catapulted celebrities into the spotlight, with nearly half of all news coverage on television and the internet focusing on celebrity gossip. This has raised concerns among many, particularly parents, about the potential impact of this attention on their children. This essay aims to explore both the positive and negative effects of celebrity culture on young minds.Being in the public eye is a significant responsibility, as fans are highly sensitive to their idols' actions. Celebrity scandals and gossip spread rapidly, often being perceived negatively by the public. For instance, celebrities involved in drug or alcohol abuse scandals are likely to face public disapproval, which can serve as a lesson to children that such behavior is unacceptable.On the other hand, excessive media coverage of celebrities seems to have a detrimental influence on children's career aspirations. Recent surveys indicate that, inspired by the glamour and wealth associated with fame, many children now aspire to become actors, actresses, or sports stars, more so than in the past. The plethora of schools aimed at grooming future stars and advertisements featuring famous individuals may mislead children into believing that these professions are not only highly sought after but also easily attainable. This could confuse children, leading them to choose careers based on media influence rather than their own interests and aptitudes.In conclusion, it is imperative for parents to be vigilant about their children's perception of celebrity culture. They should guide their children in distinguishing between celebrities who are truly talented and those who are merely famous for their shortcomings. Moreover, parents should help their children prioritize their values and aspirations, ensuring that they make life choices based on their own potential and interests, rather than the glamour and allure of celebrity lifestyles.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";"In recent years, the impact of mobile phones on social communication has become a topic of concern. While mobile phones have become an indispensable part of daily life, offering convenience and entertainment to people of all ages, I firmly believe that they also give rise to numerous social issues.Firstly, excessive phone use can have detrimental effects on social interactions. As individuals become increasingly reliant on their phones, they may lose interest in everyday activities, such as meeting friends, leading to distractions during studies or social events. Prolonged mobile phone use can also harm children's eyesight and physical posture.Moreover, many mobile games, like ""Iron Man"", promote aggressive behavior, rewarding children for violence and repetition. These games often involve killing or shooting, which can foster aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, ultimately hindering effective communication.On the other hand, some people argue that mobile phones have bridged the communication gap. With the rapid development of the internet, instant messaging apps like ""Weichat"" enable users to send free messages, reducing the need for face-to-face interaction. This has, in effect, shortened the distance between individuals.After weighing the pros and cons, it can be concluded that while mobile phones offer convenient communication, they also contribute to social problems. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of mobile phone use to maintain healthy social interactions. "
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern communication forms has undoubtedly revolutionized the way people interact with each other, anytime and without time constraints. Email and messaging services are prime examples of such advancements. I completely agree that these tools have significantly reduced the time people need to spend with their relatives to stay in touch. However, their extensive use also has some drawbacks on social lives.In today's society, people frequently rely on these electronic means to form and maintain connections. Clearly, other platforms like social media, including Twitter and Facebook, offer additional avenues for meeting friends and making communication both feasible and limitless in terms of time.From another perspective, the use of these digital facilities has led to a trend where individuals become less sociable. Being engulfed in the virtual world, they tend to avoid direct social interactions with others. This has resulted in some individuals becoming overly reliant on digital communication, lacking face-to-face interactions due to excessive use of email and messaging. Nonetheless, many people maintain the importance of personal connections, recognizing the value in meeting friends and engaging in direct conversations to foster good relationships.In conclusion, I strongly agree that the benefits of email and messaging have reduced the time required for communication. Nonetheless, it's crucial to ensure we balance this with real, in-person gatherings with colleagues and friends to maintain a healthy and well-rounded social life.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";It is unmistakable that children possess an innocent and impressionable mind, and they require proper guidance at a critical juncture to help them grasp the value of life. There is an ongoing debate about whether it is more beneficial to foster competitiveness or cooperation in children. Both approaches have their own merits, which are discussed in detail below.On one hand, competitive children tend to develop the confidence to handle situations independently. This trait is often nurtured in school, where teachers encourage students to strive for academic excellence through grading systems, prompting children to strive for the top spot by achieving the highest marks. While this competitive drive can lead to success in the long run, it can also impose limitations. For instance, multinational corporations (MNCs) emphasize teamwork, and individuals with a competitive mindset may struggle to adapt to collaborative environments.On the other hand, parents who aim to instill a sense of cooperation in their children demonstrate a desire to equip them with the skills to navigate life's challenges effectively. Although cooperative children may not exhibit the same level of competitiveness or eagerness to succeed as their competitive counterparts, they possess the ability to manage diverse situations with the support of a team.In my opinion, while competitive children may exhibit greater cleverness and speed in the initial stages, this advantage may not translate to long-term success. In contrast, cooperative children have the potential to develop and implement innovative ideas with the help of a team, ultimately leading to greater accomplishments. Therefore, I firmly believe that parents should foster a sense of cooperation in their children, enabling them to feel more fulfilled and accomplished in life.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;In today's world, a wide variety of communication systems are used extensively. As technology advances, it has numerous negative consequences in many areas. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that technology has a significant positive impact on relationships between individuals.The primary advantage of technology is that it enables people to stay in close contact with one another, regardless of their geographical location. Through the use of the internet and smartphones, people can share information and stay connected with ease. This advancement not only saves time but also provides a convenient and efficient means of communication. For instance, family members living in different countries can use the internet to stay in touch, and even feel close through the exchange of images and videos.Furthermore, technology is essential for students living in remote areas, as it allows them to share valuable resources with friends and access information that may not be available locally. Additionally, the rapid evolution of science and technology provides opportunities for people to establish social networks. In the past, people may have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to social networking websites, individuals can easily connect with like-minded people. They can also reconnect with old friends who have been out of touch for a long time, fostering the development of positive relationships.In conclusion, I agree that technology has a profoundly positive effect on people's interactions, as it facilitates the formation of new friendships and the maintenance of existing relationships. Overall, technology plays a vital role in helping ordinary people connect with one another and nurture their relationships.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The advent of technology has sparked a heated debate about the relevance of preserving traditional skills and lifestyles, with many arguing that they are no longer necessary in today's modern world. However, I firmly believe that the importance of traditions should be valued and recognized. Traditional skills and lifestyles continue to play a vital role in contemporary society, particularly in the areas of healthcare, environmental conservation, and cultural heritage. While technology has brought numerous conveniences, it has also contributed to unhealthy habits, such as sedentary lifestyles. In contrast, traditional ways of life offer a valuable complement to modern living, emphasizing the significance of work-life balance. Moreover, traditional skills, which rely minimally on fossil fuels, are more environmentally friendly and should be promoted to mitigate the threat of climate change. These tradition-related practices also convey cultural values and traditions, which are essential foundations of modern civilization. By protecting traditions, we can gain a deeper understanding of ancient cultures and utilize them to address modern challenges.Some may argue that preserving traditions is a costly endeavor, with limited financial returns. Nevertheless, I believe that the expenses incurred are negligible compared to the potential value of traditions. Therefore, government authorities and educational institutions should collaborate to promote traditional skills and ways of life, raising awareness about their importance among the general public.In conclusion, preserving traditions is not only crucial for our current society but also has a profound impact on future generations. It is essential that we recognize the significance of traditional skills and lifestyles and work together to protect and promote them, ensuring their continued relevance and importance in our modern world.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;"In today's educational system, numerous competitions are available for children in both academic and athletic fields, which can stimulate their desire to learn and strive for excellence. These competitions also provide opportunities for children to develop teamwork skills. However, there is a debate about whether it is more beneficial for children to be competitive or cooperative, with valid arguments on both sides.On one hand, a strong competitive spirit can motivate children to learn and practice, driven by the desire to outperform their peers. This competitiveness is often encouraged by schools and parents through grading systems, which can foster a sense of achievement and independence. Competitive children tend to be more motivated to pursue goals and overcome challenges on their own. Nevertheless, an overemphasis on competitiveness can lead to difficulties in cooperating with others, which is essential in many areas of life, such as team projects.On the other hand, cooperation is a vital quality for children to develop, whether in school activities or community engagements. A cooperative spirit enables kids to communicate effectively, build relationships, and work together towards common goals. In real-world scenarios, achieving significant success rarely happens in isolation; even highly talented individuals, such as famous singers or movie stars, rely on teams to manage and facilitate their work. This underscores the importance of teamwork in achieving goals and solving problems.From my perspective, while competitiveness can drive motivation and success, it may not provide the necessary skills for thriving in society or the workplace, where teamwork is highly valued. In conclusion, I believe that schools and adults should prioritize instilling a sense of cooperation in children, as this will better prepare them to become valuable and effective members of society and their communities."
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;In today's world, advertising plays a significant role in helping people make informed purchasing decisions. With the aid of advertisements, consumers can easily access detailed information and instructions about products that meet their needs. While some argue that the drawbacks of advertising outweigh its benefits, I firmly believe that advertising brings more advantages than disadvantages to our lives.On one hand, it is evident that many advertisements exaggerate the quality of their products, often overlooking potential negative consequences. Furthermore, the plethora of advertisements claiming to offer the best products can confuse consumers when trying to choose the most suitable option. For instance, certain shampoos like Sunsilk, Clear, and Dove are marketed as miracle products that can restore damaged hair, along with numerous other benefits. However, the reality is that not all customers are satisfied with their purchases, which were influenced by advertisements.On the other hand, it is an undeniable fact that the advertising industry provides numerous job opportunities for people with diverse skills, including producers, writers, models, and cameramen. Additionally, advertising enables consumers to become familiar with companies and their products, allowing them to make informed decisions. Take Coca Cola, for example, a company that has invested heavily in advertising, resulting in widespread recognition and popularity among customers globally. Moreover, online advertising has become one of the most convenient and cost-effective approaches, offering benefits such as lower costs, convenience, and easy monitoring.In conclusion, like everything else, advertising has its pros and cons. From my perspective, advertising would be more effective if producers and advertisers were more honest and transparent in their advertisements, providing consumers with a comprehensive view of a product. This would ultimately lead to more informed decision-making and a better overall experience for consumers.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";"The disparity in earnings between individuals can be perceived as unfair. In the artistic field, modern artists may receive substantial salaries for their creative masterpieces, whereas laborers may have to toil for years to earn a similar amount. Although some argue that the government should address this imbalance, critics counter that the government should not intervene. I concur that the government should not attempt to rectify this situation.Proficiency and perfection in artwork are often rewarded with high compensation. Modern artists who bring their innovative ideas to life are paid handsomely by art collectors. The significant sums they receive are a reflection of the quality and rarity of their work, rather than the quantity produced. For instance, a handmade 15-centimeter Buddha temple is valued far more than a mass-produced equivalent. Moreover, modern artists dedicate themselves to finding unique concepts that ordinary people cannot replicate, making the impossible possible. A notable example is Pieter Padang, the creator of Minions, who cleverly altered song lyrics to create a humorous effect, earning him a substantial amount for his idea.In stark contrast, laborers working in merchandise factories earn relatively low wages, even if they produce hundreds of 15-centimeter Buddha temples daily. Similarly, a musician who repeatedly plays a song like ""I swear"" earns differently than Padang, as they are re-performing rather than creating. The government cannot equalize the value of modern art because it is subjective and dependent on personal taste, making it challenging to establish a standard parameter for evaluation.As mentioned earlier, the substantial earnings of modern artists are a result of their struggles and dedication to their craft, with the term ""struggle"" potentially differing from one field to another. I agree that the government should not attempt to equalize salaries between modern artists and other professions, as the value of art is inherently tied to personal taste."
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";"In today's fast-paced world, working long hours has become the norm. A wise saying from my hometown resonates with me: ""Health is Wealth."" Unfortunately, I believe many people, including myself, often overlook the significance of health. The pressure to work longer hours may stem from the increasingly competitive environment and the desire for financial gain and career advancement. However, research has shown that extended working hours can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health, as well as personal relationships.In my opinion, striking a balance between personal and professional life is crucial, and this can be achieved by imposing a maximum number of working hours. Firstly, it's undeniable that individuals who work excessively long hours often neglect their health. Prolonged work periods can lead to fatigue, laziness, and a lack of motivation to engage in physical exercise, ultimately resulting in poor health and increased susceptibility to illness. Moreover, these individuals can become overly consumed by their work, adopting a ""workaholic"" lifestyle that isolates them from their loved ones. The consequences are severe, causing an imbalance in their family and personal life, leaving their relationships with family and friends to suffer.Secondly, those who are consumed by their work often don't contribute to societal well-being by participating in social activities. Their hectic schedules leave little to no time for leisure or community engagement. For instance, my boss, who has spent years working extended hours, recently experienced a drastic decline in his health and personal life. His relationship with his wife ended, and his family life is now in disarray. Only after reaching a breaking point did he attempt to reassess his priorities, but for him, it may be too late.In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the government to incorporate a clause in the Labor Law that enforces companies to adhere to a maximum number of working hours for their employees. This policy would uplift society as a whole and help individuals reclaim the balance between their personal and professional lives. By prioritizing health and well-being, we can work towards a more harmonious and sustainable future."
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;In today's society, it's common to define a successful person as someone who has amassed a significant amount of wealth. However, each individual has their own unique vision of success. Personally, I believe that a successful person is one who has achieved notable accomplishments in life, rather than simply earning a high income.While money is undoubtedly important, the means of earning it can vary greatly. A person's prosperity does not necessarily indicate that they have earned it honestly or through their own efforts. Nevertheless, true achievement can only be attained through hard work, dedication, and passion. Whether it's a personal or social achievement, a person who has worked tirelessly to accomplish their goals is worthy of admiration.What's more, the greater the benefit of their achievement to society, the more successful they are considered. For example, Thomas Edison is widely regarded as one of the greatest inventors of the 20th century, thanks to the countless useful applications of his inventions. On the other hand, the way a person uses their wealth is often private, making it difficult to judge their success solely based on their income.In conclusion, using wealth as the sole measure of a person's success is insufficient, despite its importance in meeting basic needs. Instead, a person is often considered successful when their achievements, which can only be accomplished through passion, dedication, and ethics, are beneficial not only to themselves, but also to society as a whole. This is the true mark of a successful individual, and one that goes beyond mere financial wealth.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;In today's world, people's consumption choices are significantly influenced by the numerous advertisements they are exposed to through various media, including television, streets, and magazines. It can be argued that these advertisements have the power to sway individuals into purchasing items they do not necessarily need. For instance, in many Asian countries, advertisement companies often enlist popular singers or actors to promote products, which can lead to fans, especially adolescents, buying these products as a way to support their idols rather than to fulfill a genuine need.Moreover, products are often portrayed as more attractive and of higher quality in advertisements, which can prompt impulsive buying decisions without much thought. Effective advertising can convince people that they want a particular product, even if it doesn't align with their actual needs or the needs of society. This, in turn, can create a trend where people purchase products influenced by advertising, even if they don't genuinely need them.However, buying habits are highly personal and not solely determined by advertising. Individuals' needs and consumption capabilities play a significant role. It's less likely for adults, who are mindful of budgeting their disposable income, to make impulsive purchases. They often have to allocate their money carefully among different expenses. On the other hand, children and adolescents, who are not economically independent, are more likely to make impulsive purchases without considering their actual needs, largely because they are not yet under financial pressures and lack the maturity to discern what is necessary.In my view, buying habits are a matter of personal choice, not entirely dictated by advertisements. Nonetheless, for children and adolescents whose judgment is still developing, it can be challenging to resist the influence of advertising. Therefore, it's crucial for governments to regulate advertisement companies, especially those targeting youngsters, such as toy companies, to prevent biased perceptions of what they truly need. This regulatory approach can help mitigate the undue influence of advertising on vulnerable populations.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The obligation to pay taxes is a universal responsibility of citizens in nearly every country. However, some individuals believe that paying taxes is sufficient contribution to their nation. I personally disagree with this perspective.Firstly, it is essential that all capable working individuals contribute to the government through taxation, as it is the primary source of government revenue. This revenue is utilized to provide services to all citizens, with a significant portion allocated to national defense and maintaining social stability. This enables everyone to work and live in a peaceful environment. Additionally, tax revenue is used to pay the salaries of public service workers, such as teachers and police officers, who may not generate direct profit but contribute significantly to the well-being of society. Nevertheless, I argue that citizens have additional crucial responsibilities beyond paying taxes. Every society has impoverished or disabled individuals who require assistance and support from others. Although the government provides some financial aid, it is often insufficient. In such cases, aid from more capable citizens is vital and serves as a valuable complement to government support. Furthermore, citizens should collaborate with the police force to maintain social stability. With a limited number of police officers, it is necessary for local residents to take action and ensure community safety by reporting suspicious activities to the authorities.In conclusion, paying taxes is a significant obligation of citizens. However, it is not the only responsibility they must undertake. Citizens have other critical duties to fulfill in order to maintain a functioning and orderly society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";"There is ongoing debate about the subjects that should be included in school curricula. While I acknowledge the importance of studying a wide range of subjects, I disagree with the notion that supposedly non-essential subjects like music and sports should be eliminated from the program.Many individuals believe that students should focus solely on academic subjects such as mathematics and physics, as these are deemed crucial for their future prospects. This perspective is understandable, given the highly competitive job market and the need for students to meet specific qualification requirements. Furthermore, the consistently high unemployment rate leads many parents to encourage their children to pursue subjects that will increase their chances of securing employment.However, I would argue that there are aspects of education that are equally, if not more, important than job preparation. Firstly, studying music, art, or sports is vital for students, as it allows them to explore their potential and discover the world around them. Secondly, to succeed in the job market, students need to possess not only technical skills but also soft skills, such as teamwork and presentation abilities. For example, participating in sports can teach students about teamwork, collaboration, and camaraderie. Therefore, these subjects can play a significant role in fostering students' abilities. Finally, a child's future is not solely dependent on the academic subjects they study in school; rather, it is the result of their hard work, dedication, and innate capacity.In conclusion, while academic subjects undoubtedly play a vital role in nurturing children, I firmly believe that the impact of learning music and sports is profound and should not be underestimated. These subjects offer a unique set of benefits that can complement academic learning and contribute to the well-rounded development of students."
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The rise of digital media has led to a significant decline in the popularity of traditional paper media, such as newspapers and magazines. As a result, many believe that these forms of media will soon become obsolete. I share this view, arguing that the internet's ability to provide rapid access to current affairs and historical news will ultimately lead to the demise of print media.One of the primary responsibilities of media is to disseminate information about current events in a timely manner, particularly during crises. In such situations, digital media outpaces traditional media, providing trustworthy information within hours. For instance, when Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing, people turned to the internet for updates, rather than waiting for the next print publication. This exemplifies the superiority of digital media in terms of speed and accessibility.Moreover, people often require access to past news for research, personal interest, or other purposes. For example, a researcher might want to investigate the aftermath of World War II in a small Japanese village like Oramaki. Finding such specific information in newspapers and magazines can be a daunting task, as one would need to know where to look. In contrast, the internet offers an efficient search function, enabling users to quickly find relevant information. This feature is a significant advantage of digital media over traditional print media.In conclusion, digital media's rapid response time and vast repository of information make it an increasingly popular choice for news consumption. Although traditional media may persist for a few more years due to existing infrastructure and people's habits, ultimately, digital media will supplant newspapers and magazines as the primary source of news and information. The writing is on the wall: with its unparalleled speed and accessibility, digital media is poised to revolutionize the way we consume news and information.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;While salary is often a key consideration when choosing a job, I argue that it is not the only factor that matters. In fact, I believe that other aspects, such as a supportive work environment, positive relationships with colleagues, and opportunities for professional growth, are equally, if not more, important.It is undeniable that a decent salary is necessary to cover daily expenses and maintain a certain standard of living. However, research has shown that factors like workplace culture, colleague relationships, and job satisfaction can have a profound impact on a person's overall happiness and quality of life. For instance, individuals who dislike their coworkers or work in poor conditions often report lower job satisfaction, despite earning a high salary. This serves as evidence to support my claim that salary is not the sole determinant of job satisfaction.Moreover, a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction in one's job often stems from professional achievements, skill development, and career advancement. Receiving recognition or promotions from one's organization can be a more significant source of pride and motivation than a high salary. For example, individuals in mundane jobs with limited opportunities for growth or recognition may feel unfulfilled, even if they earn a good income.In conclusion, I disagree with the notion that salary is the primary motivator for job choice. Instead, I believe that factors like a positive work environment, supportive colleagues, and opportunities for professional growth and recognition are equally, if not more, important considerations.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;In today's digital age, computers have become an indispensable part of daily life, and their impact is particularly significant on children. While some may argue that excessive computer use can have negative effects on children, this viewpoint will be challenged by examining the numerous ways in which computers facilitate children's access to vast online resources, enabling them to study effectively and develop essential skills that will benefit their future careers.One of the most significant advantages of the internet is the vast array of information available in various formats, including text, images, and videos, which cover almost every topic imaginable. Through computers, children can easily access this wealth of information to gain knowledge on subjects they are studying or interested in. For instance, students preparing to deliver a speech on a specific topic can browse the internet to learn intricate details about the subject matter, which would be challenging to find in a single physical location without computer access. This highlights the positive impact of computers on children's learning experiences.Moreover, computers have revolutionized the way people prepare presentations, create complex graphs and pictures, and document theses in a straightforward yet efficient manner. When children are introduced to computers at a young age, they become familiar with these skills, ultimately becoming proficient before entering the professional world. For example, students who learn to create Microsoft PowerPoint presentations for school projects gain a competitive edge early in their careers. This demonstrates the positive influence of computers on children's skill development and future career readiness.Given the evidence of computers' contributions to children's academic success and skill-building, which are crucial for their future careers, it is clear that computers are a valuable resource for children. However, it is essential for parents to provide guidance and oversight to ensure that children use computers responsibly and do not get misled by potential drawbacks. By doing so, children can harness the full potential of computers to enhance their educational and professional development.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;I strongly disagree with the notion that children raised in less affluent families are more resourceful and better equipped to handle adult life problems compared to those from wealthier backgrounds. To start with, children from disadvantaged families are more likely to develop negative habits such as delinquency, theft, and violence. Additionally, they often lack access to quality education, making them more susceptible to radical ideologies. For instance, many extremist groups target uneducated individuals, as those with better education tend to have a broader perspective, making them less vulnerable to manipulation. Consequently, people with limited education are more prone to being swayed by such ideologies.On the other hand, children from affluent families have access to good education, which has a positive impact on their future. Furthermore, they develop essential skills in managing finances, as they are accustomed to handling money. Lastly, wealthy families can afford superior healthcare services and expensive medications, which greatly benefits a child's health. For example, many effective medicines are costly, and poorer families often cannot afford them.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children raised in less well-off families are more likely to succeed in life due to the aforementioned reasons. The advantages of growing up in a wealthy family, including access to quality education, financial management skills, and better healthcare, provide a stronger foundation for future success.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;It is undeniable that modern society is grappling with a plethora of new health issues and ailments that were previously unheard of. While many attribute this phenomenon to a sedentary lifestyle, I concur that it is a significant contributing factor, but I also believe that other factors have an even more profound impact.Initially, I acknowledge that a sedentary lifestyle is a precursor to numerous serious health problems. The primary reason for this pervasive sedentarism is the advent of advanced technology. In bygone eras, entertainment options were limited and often required physical presence, resulting in more outdoor activities. In contrast, contemporary city dwellers spend most of their time seated in front of TVs or other devices.However, there are other causal factors contributing to the surge in serious medical problems. Firstly, the modern world's environment is severely polluted by greenhouse gas emissions and other noxious gases, leading to a rise in allergies and other respiratory issues. Secondly, the proliferation of low-quality foods, such as fast food, junk food, and genetically modified products, has a deleterious impact on our health. Lastly, the stresses of modern life, including traffic congestion, accidents, and other urban woes, are taking a significant toll on our well-being.In light of these findings, it is evident that the emergence of new illnesses can be attributed to the aforementioned factors. While a sedentary lifestyle is certainly a contributing factor, it is by no means the sole culprit, and a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between these factors is necessary to combat the rising tide of health problems.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The introduction of foreign languages to children is a topic of debate among educational institutions, with some advocating for early introduction in pre-school and others suggesting it should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered significant attention in academic circles due to its potential impact on children's learning outcomes. Personally, I firmly believe that teaching children a secondary language as early as kindergarten is essential.Initially, it is understandable that children may feel uncomfortable using a language other than their native tongue during their kindergarten years. Learning should be made convenient and accessible for them, which may involve using language they are familiar with. Additionally, some educators argue that introducing foreign languages too early can lead to confusion, especially if teachers are not adequately trained to deliver quality education in the specific language.However, it is undeniable that children are incredibly adept learners, and their younger years are the optimal time for language acquisition. The introduction of a foreign language may be novel to them, but their natural curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. This approach enables children to grasp new languages in a more organic and intuitive way. Furthermore, the benefits of early foreign language introduction are twofold, benefiting both students and teachers. By introducing languages early, teachers will find it easier to build upon this foundation in later years, rather than attempting to introduce complex concepts during adolescence.In conclusion, while there are differing opinions on the matter, I am convinced that the early introduction of foreign language instruction in kindergarten, when properly implemented, will lead to significant improvements in children's learning abilities. The advantages of this approach clearly outweigh the disadvantages, and I firmly support the idea of teaching foreign languages to children from a young age.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The rapid growth of international tourism over the past few decades has been fueled by advancements in long-distance transportation. While some argue that this surge in tourism has created more problems than benefits, I firmly disagree. On one hand, it is undeniable that tourism can have detrimental effects on the natural environment. The construction of facilities and infrastructure to cater to tourists can lead to the destruction of natural habitats, while also resulting in increased pollution and waste, including higher emissions of greenhouse gases, litter, and overconsumption of water, power, and energy in luxury hotels. At first glance, these negative impacts on ecosystems and local resources seem to outweigh any potential benefits, suggesting that tourism should be discouraged.However, a thriving tourism industry can have a profoundly positive impact on the local economy. Tourists visiting foreign countries generate significant revenue through their expenditures on attractions, food, accommodations, transportation, and entertainment. This influx of money can be a lucrative source of income for both local residents and governments, while also creating numerous job opportunities. Moreover, I believe that the income derived from tourism can be strategically utilized to mitigate pollution and protect the environment, thus creating a positive feedback loop.Moreover, the expansion of tourism has been highly beneficial for travelers. The availability of direct flights and comprehensive local amenities enables tourists to travel with ease and comfort, allowing them to dedicate more time to leisure and relaxation during their holidays. Additionally, the interchange between locals and tourists facilitates cultural exchange, fostering open-mindedness, dispelling preconceptions, and enhancing mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism has the potential to yield benefits on a global scale. Although there are undeniable challenges associated with tourism, these are eclipsed by the advantages and can be effectively addressed through the implementation of proper measures.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;Education is undeniably crucial for an individual's development, and while some may argue that learning through television is effective for certain children, I strongly disagree with the notion of increasing TV time for students. Traditional education has long been established as the most effective method, and promoting physical inactivity for the sake of improving skills is misguided.Firstly, conventional teaching methods have been scientifically proven to be the best way to educate a child. Although technology has positively impacted the education sector to some extent, it has not diminished the importance of teachers in the classroom. The fact that students now complete homework and research on computers instead of visiting libraries illustrates this point. However, screens cannot replace the invaluable presence of educators, whose knowledge and adaptability are irreplaceable. Therefore, teachers cannot be substituted with inanimate screens.Secondly, watching television is a passive activity that should not be encouraged by increasing screen time. In contrast, children who engage in activities that foster creativity, cooperation, and competition tend to perform significantly better overall. For example, an experiment demonstrated that a child who participated in outdoor activities outperformed a child who spent most of their time watching documentaries in skills such as identifying different types of plants and animals. As a result, such activities can equip a child with essential skills that are valuable for their future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning through television may suit some children, kids should not be encouraged to engage in such a passive activity. Schools have successfully applied traditional teaching methods for centuries, and they continue to be the most effective way to equip a child with essential skills.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;We are undoubtedly living in the age of the internet, which has a profound impact on both our personal and professional lives. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in developed countries, where many individuals opt to work or study from the comfort of their own homes rather than commuting to offices or universities. While some people view this trend as beneficial, others see it as a disadvantage. This discussion will examine both perspectives in turn.On the one hand, the advantages of working or studying from home are significant. For professionals, it facilitates a better work-life balance. For example, new mothers can easily balance their job responsibilities with childcare duties. Additionally, people enjoy greater flexibility in their working hours. Similarly, for students, studying from home is an attractive option as it saves them time and effort that would be spent commuting to and from universities. In bustling cities like Tokyo, where travel times are notoriously long, this saved time can be productively utilized for studies. The benefits of working or studying from home are thus evident.On the other hand, some members of society express concerns about the productivity of those who prefer to work or study from home. Many employers argue that remote work leads to increased time spent on communication via phone or email with colleagues, potentially harming an employee's productivity. Similarly, teachers worry that students who study from home may struggle to clarify doubts about study topics in real-time, leading to a lag in their academic progress. These factors potentially undermine the effectiveness of working or studying from home.Considering both viewpoints, it appears that the option to work or study from home offers more advantages than disadvantages. It is anticipated that people will continue to leverage the internet for work and study purposes, addressing and improving upon the current drawbacks in the foreseeable future.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;I concur with the dual perspectives on international tourism, acknowledging that it can both create tension and foster understanding between individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. When conflicts or debates arise, people are often motivated to make an effort to understand each other, thereby bridging the cultural divide.Undoubtedly, certain behaviors exhibited by tourists can be unwelcome in local areas. For instance, some tourists litter after visiting attractions, necessitating frequent cleaning by local residents to maintain a tidy environment for incoming tourists. Additionally, cultural differences can lead to unintentional offenses. For example, in India, where cows are revered, consuming beef is taboo. To show respect for local traditions, tourists should refrain from ordering beef in local restaurants.On the other hand, efforts are being made to mitigate conflicts between foreigners and locals by promoting cross-cultural understanding and finding solutions. For example, tourists are provided with brochures outlining local customs and traditions before their visit. Moreover, tour guides are eager to assist tourists in comprehending foreign cultures, which in turn reduces the likelihood of conflicts. Evidently, when confronted with conflicts stemming from international tourism, people seek solutions that involve mutual understanding. Therefore, I firmly believe that international tourism has the potential to both generate tension and foster understanding among people from diverse cultural backgrounds.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;Some individuals believe that celebrities are recognized more for their luxurious lifestyle than for their professional accomplishments. While I concede that this can have negative consequences for the younger generation, I also think that this is not always the case for celebrities who are dedicated to their craft.It is undeniable that some celebrities often prioritize presenting a glamorous image to the public. For instance, certain movie stars revel in wearing high-end designer clothing and showcasing their opulent lifestyle to the media, thereby garnering attention and admiration. If this behavior continues, it may create a distorted perception among young people, leading them to believe that an extraordinary life can be attained without diligent effort. As a result, young people may become fixated on pursuing celebrity status, which can be detrimental to their study habits, work ethics, and overall character development.However, I firmly believe that many celebrities serve as positive role models for young people, thanks to their tangible achievements. Firstly, celebrities like sports athletes, whose performances and skills are directly observable by their fans, demonstrate that hard work and perseverance are essential to achieving success. This can inspire young people to cultivate their talents through dedication and persistence. Secondly, musicians, such as the legendary Michael Jackson, have achieved immense success and have a profound impact on the younger generation. His music, which promotes unity and compassion, offers valuable lessons on how to become a responsible and caring member of society.In conclusion, although some celebrities may mislead young people by showcasing their wealth and material possessions, many others provide a positive influence, guiding young people in the right direction and promoting values such as hard work, perseverance, and social responsibility.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;While television is a vast source of information and can be a valuable tool for learning and skill development, I firmly believe that unrestricted TV viewing at both home and school can have a detrimental impact on a student's overall growth. Excessive TV watching can have severe consequences on a child's health and academic performance.On the one hand, TV is an excellent source of data and information, with various international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, and Etv Marathi, which keep viewers informed about current events. Watching TV can also help children develop skills in extracurricular activities, such as cooking programs that teach new recipes, or sports events like cricket and football that promote leadership, teamwork, communication, and other essential skills that can benefit them in their future careers.On the other hand, prolonged TV viewing can have devastating effects on children's health. For instance, it can lead to poor eyesight at a young age, back pain, and other physical problems. Moreover, exposure to age-inappropriate content can have severe psychological consequences. Many students become addicted to their favorite shows, such as cartoons or sports programs, which can distract them from their studies, particularly during exam periods, ultimately affecting their grades.In conclusion, I strongly believe that the drawbacks of TV viewing outweigh its benefits. If students are allowed to watch TV without proper supervision or control from parents or teachers, it can lead to more negative consequences, ultimately hindering their overall development.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;Throughout human history, the younger generation has consistently demonstrated greater adaptability and advancement than their predecessors. This trend persists in today's industrial society, where younger workers are often preferred for employment and promotion over those over 50. There are three key reasons that explain the limited responsiveness of older workers to the modern workplace.Firstly, older workers often cling to outdated paradigms, having been raised in a time of poverty and war, which has instilled in them a negative and pessimistic worldview. This mindset makes them resistant to change and skeptical of modern innovations, such as automation and technology. For instance, many would rather manually assemble machine parts than rely on robotic automation, due to their distrust of its efficiency and safety compared to human capabilities.Secondly, the attitude of older workers towards life also contributes to their limited responsiveness. With a growing awareness of their declining health and decreasing enthusiasm, they tend to prefer routine and safe ideologies. In contrast, younger individuals are often characterized by their adventurousness and bravery, which are essential for driving innovation and success in most companies. The accomplishments of many companies can be attributed to the creative ideas and fresh perspectives of young people, who are able to keep pace with the rapidly changing world.Lastly, knowledge is a crucial factor that gives younger workers an edge over their older counterparts. When faced with the choice between an older worker with outdated education and a younger worker who is not only proficient in fundamental subjects but also skilled in programming, foreign languages, and other modern essentials, the employer is likely to choose the latter. This is not to undermine the value of older workers, but rather to acknowledge that their lack of expertise in these critical areas can lead to incompetence in the modern workplace.In summary, workers over 50 have been outpaced by the younger generation in various aspects. Nevertheless, from my perspective, it is essential to maintain a harmonious coexistence between both age groups to ensure the smooth operation of a company. By valuing and integrating the contributions of all workers, regardless of age, companies can leverage a broader range of skills, experiences, and perspectives to achieve success.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The past few decades have witnessed unprecedented advancements in technology, with the increased use of machines being a notable trend. This shift has sparked a debate about the impact of machines on human life. While some people view the growing reliance on machines as a positive development, others believe it has detrimental effects on human health. This discussion will examine both perspectives before arriving at a reasoned conclusion.On one hand, many individuals argue that the widespread use of machines is detrimental to human health, as it reduces physical activity. For instance, the replacement of staircases with elevators in many institutions has led to a decline in physical exertion. Research has shown that frequent use of elevators in workplaces contributes to obesity. This example illustrates a clear link between machine usage and adverse health consequences.On the other hand, many people believe that machines simplify tasks and reduce the time required to complete them. The use of food processors in kitchens is a prime example. These machines have made tasks such as chopping, blending, and kneading effortless, allowing people to complete their work more efficiently. It is evident that machines make daily tasks less time-consuming and labor-intensive.After evaluating these two perspectives, it appears that the benefits of using machines outweigh the drawbacks. Machines undoubtedly make work easier and more streamlined. While it is true that excessive machine usage can have negative health effects, it is possible to mitigate these effects by engaging in alternative forms of exercise and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is likely that in the future, people will continue to embrace machine usage and explore alternative ways to stay healthy and disease-free.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;In today's world, most countries are investing heavily in technology, and it's clear that technology has a positive impact on the economy. Many people believe that traditional practices and ways of life will eventually become obsolete and should be phased out. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion.First and foremost, traditional skills and methods are an integral part of a country's cultural heritage. They differentiate one country from another and showcase a nation's creativity and intelligence. As a result, people take pride in their country's unique traditions and strive to preserve them. For instance, the techniques used to build houses vary from country to country, and these differences are what set them apart.Moreover, there are cases where traditional methods cannot be replaced by new technology. Many people prefer to use traditional products because of their superior quality and durability. For example, handmade vases are often more prized than their machine-made counterparts. Furthermore, there are many crafts that can only be done by hand, making them truly unique. The production of cone hats from leaves is a prime example, as it requires manual labor not only because there is no machine capable of doing the job, but also because handmade products are often more beautiful and valuable.Lastly, traditional skills and ways of life play a significant role in education. By preserving and passing on traditional methods to younger generations, they can learn about their history and the techniques used by their ancestors. This can inspire them to create innovative and useful things that can improve people's lives.In conclusion, while technology has brought numerous benefits, traditional skills and ways of life are invaluable and will endure forever. They are an essential part of our cultural identity and continue to have a significant impact on our economy and education.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;Modern cities can be characterized as melting pots, where the issue of traffic overload, resulting from overpopulation, has sparked the interest of many urban planners. It is often argued that the only way to tackle the seemingly insurmountable problem of traffic congestion is to reduce the number of people on the streets. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, as there are two alternative solutions that can effectively alleviate traffic gridlock.Firstly, investing in public transportation is crucial to minimizing the number of vehicles on the road. Buses and trains have been successfully integrated into urban transportation systems for a long time, proving to be the most efficient options. Notably, a single bus can transport at least 30 people, while a train can carry up to nine or ten times that number. Furthermore, underground trains can operate without contributing to street congestion, leaving room for buses and environmentally friendly vehicles to share the roads. By utilizing these modes of transportation, cities can significantly reduce congestion and alleviate the crowded streets that are typical of modern urban areas.Secondly, it is essential to recognize the importance of urban planning and the strategic use of suburban areas. By relocating large shopping malls, universities, and other attractions to the outskirts of cities, urban planners can reduce the strain on city streets and public facilities. When large centers of activity are distributed evenly throughout a region, residential areas tend to follow, resulting in a more balanced and less congested urban environment. This, in turn, can help to mitigate the pressure on cities to accommodate an influx of immigrants and job seekers.In conclusion, city planners still have viable alternatives to relying solely on reducing the number of people on the streets. Investing in public transportation and strategically utilizing suburban areas can effectively alleviate traffic congestion. This approach is particularly relevant for developing countries like Vietnam and China, where the demand for jobs and education is rapidly increasing. By adopting these solutions, cities can create more sustainable and efficient transportation systems, ultimately improving the quality of life for their citizens.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The influence of media and celebrities on young people worldwide is profound. The glamorous lifestyles of these celebrities have made them extremely popular among younger generations. However, it is widely acknowledged that emulating celebrities can have detrimental effects on the youth. This essay will examine the impact of following celebrities on the health and personality of young people, demonstrating the potential dangers of blind admiration.Firstly, it is evident that blindly following celebrities can have severe consequences for the health of adolescents. Many young individuals are tempted to engage in unhealthy habits, such as drug use and smoking, at a relatively early age. A notable example is a university survey that revealed approximately 40% of students started smoking in an attempt to emulate their favorite screen actor. This striking example illustrates the negative influence of imitating celebrities on the health of young individuals.Furthermore, it is believed that following celebrities can also have a corrosive effect on the personality of young people. Adolescents often mimic not only the makeup and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. A recent poll conducted by an American magazine found that a significant number of parents and teachers complained about teenagers using derogatory language and abusive words at home and in school. This example clearly demonstrates the poor impact of glamorous celebrities on the conduct of young people.In conclusion, it is clear that following celebrities can have a profoundly negative impact on both the health and behavior of young people. This, in turn, can have far-reaching consequences for an individual's personality and future prospects. Therefore, it is essential that young people are educated to think critically about their celebrity idols and not blindly follow them. Instead, they should focus on their careers, paving the way for a brighter future. By doing so, young people can avoid the potential pitfalls of celebrity culture and develop into well-rounded, responsible individuals.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;For many years, the issue of gender equality has been a topic of discussion, with the aim of achieving a balanced distribution of human resources. Implementing equal education rights and policies is considered a crucial step towards sustainability. Many institutions now strive to maintain a balanced ratio of male and female students in various courses, a development I strongly support.In recent years, the proportion of women in the workforce has been increasing globally, prompting stakeholders to consider the necessary preparations for maintaining economic growth and improving the quality of life. Women are now pursuing careers in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as engineering and mechanics, demonstrating their capabilities and potential. This shift has shown that women can excel in roles previously thought to be the exclusive domain of men, highlighting their equal potential and abilities as compared to their male counterparts.Furthermore, obtaining a higher education degree is essential for establishing a successful career. In today's competitive job market, having a university degree is often a prerequisite for securing a position. Education broadens one's knowledge and experience, equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate real-world challenges. Therefore, providing equal access to education for both men and women is not only fair but also essential for their career development.In conclusion, acquiring developed skills and earning a degree certificate is indispensable for building a career, regardless of gender. As the world continues to evolve, addressing educational needs is vital for competing with future challenges. Implementing and applying equal education policies will be crucial in preparing individuals to face the demands of an ever-changing world, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary tools to succeed.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;Globally, smoking has been widely regarded as a harmful and deadly habit. Every year, millions of smokers succumb to cancers, such as lung and oral cancer, as a result of their addiction. Furthermore, this hazardous behavior also poses health risks to passive smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke in environments where smoking is prevalent. Consequently, it is argued that smoking should be prohibited in public areas like bus and train stations. This stance will be substantiated by examining the benefits that this regulation has brought to both the general public and smokers.To begin with, the non-smoking public would undoubtedly benefit from the enforcement of such restrictions. Prior to the 1980s, public places in Sri Lanka exemplified an unpleasant scenario where individuals smoked freely, even in public transportation, which sometimes led to aggressive incidents. However, after the implementation of smoking restrictions, the situation came under control, and this has proven to be a benefit to the public.Moreover, introducing a smoking ban in public places would significantly deter people from smoking. For instance, the enforcement of a smoking ban in the capital of Sri Lanka has led to a reduction in smoking-related diseases and deaths, according to the Ministry of Health. This demonstrates that smoking restrictions have successfully discouraged the public from this harmful habit, thereby reducing the strain on the country's healthcare system.After analyzing the effects of smoking bans in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven that this arrangement has numerous benefits. It is hoped that governments will consider following in the footsteps of Sri Lanka and other countries by implementing smoking bans in public places.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;Tourism has long been a contentious issue, with some viewing it as a culprit behind economic disruption, environmental degradation, and irreparable damage to exploited areas. However, I strongly disagree with this misconception for two key reasons.Firstly, tourism plays a vital role in fostering local economies in a way that is both sustainable and beneficial. Many tourist attractions are located in remote or wilderness areas, where the economy was previously underdeveloped. The investment of tourism companies leads to the establishment of hotels, services, and infrastructure, which in turn attracts significant attention and generates substantial income for local residents. In essence, tourism helps to steer the local economy in the right direction, allowing it to reach its full potential.Secondly, while environmental damage is an unfortunate inevitability, it is unfair to blame tourism alone for this issue. In fact, the development of tourist areas often involves careful consideration and preservation of the natural scenery. For instance, significant resources are dedicated to maintaining the local flora and fauna, including tree trimming, flower watering, and conservation efforts. Moreover, the emergence of ecotourism, a environmentally friendly service, has raised awareness about the importance of protecting coexisting species and ecosystems. Therefore, tourism should not be solely blamed for its perceived detrimental impact on ecological diversity.In conclusion, tourism has demonstrated its positive impact on exploited areas, both financially and environmentally. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and education can be a powerful tool in promoting a harmonious relationship between humans and their surroundings. By embracing sustainable tourism practices, we can work towards a future where economic growth and environmental conservation go hand in hand.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The advent of information technology (IT) over the past 20 years has led to significant improvements in living standards and work efficiency. However, it is also believed that this evolution has a darker side. In my opinion, it is likely that future developments in IT will come at the expense of its users.The rapid pace of IT development appears to have enslaved its users. In the past, the internet was limited to the World Wide Web and email, but it has since expanded to include games, online TV shows, and various means of communication, with no end in sight. These irresistible temptations lure people away from the real world and into virtual ones, resulting in a dependence on technology. Furthermore, the lack of social skills gained from outdoor activities will exacerbate the problem of IT addiction, causing individuals to prefer staying indoors with their computers and mobile phones.The future of IT has also raised concerns about health issues. The existence of video conferencing platforms like Skype, Viber, and Yahoo has made it possible to connect with others across vast distances with just a click. As a result, people rarely venture out of their comfort zones, surrounded by snacks and air conditioning, to interact with others in person. Needless to say, this sedentary lifestyle will inevitably lead to a host of health problems, including obesity, shortsightedness, diabetes, and heart-related issues.In conclusion, despite the benefits of IT to society, its impact on users' independence and health should not be ignored. In my view, there needs to be some adjustments made before IT has an even more profound impact on individuals' lives. 
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;Throughout history, humans have considered meat a fundamental source of protein. It has been a staple in meals for families worldwide. However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of vegetarians. While some attribute this shift to concerns about animal rights, others believe it stems from a more complex set of factors. In my opinion, people primarily adopt a vegetarian diet for health and religious reasons.Firstly, the pursuit of better health is a major driver behind the growing popularity of vegetarian diets. Research has shown that various vegetables contain antioxidants that can help prevent cancer, underscoring the health benefits of a plant-based diet. Although some argue that a meat-free diet can lead to inadequate protein intake, it has been proven that certain beans, such as soybeans and peas, are comparable protein sources.Secondly, religious beliefs also play a significant role in the adoption of a vegetarian diet. Certain religions, like Buddhism, believe that animals are sentient beings that were human in their past lives, making the consumption of their meat equivalent to eating the flesh of one's own parents. While this view may be perceived as unscientific, I firmly believe that adhering to one's religious practices is essential for achieving mental enlightenment.In conclusion, it is clear to me that people choose to become vegetarians primarily due to health and religious concerns, rather than solely for the welfare of animals. Nevertheless, a nutritionally balanced meal is always the most recommended option.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The integration of technological advancements in certain countries will undoubtedly be accompanied by the introduction of modern skills and lifestyles. Some argue that this phenomenon, often referred to as cultural invasion, will lead to the erosion of national traditions, rendering them obsolete. However, in my opinion, what is more likely to occur is a shift in the role of tradition within society, rather than its complete disappearance.It is indisputable that a nation's cultural heritage is primarily preserved through traditional skills and ways of life. For example, in Vietnam, traditional water puppet shows that once showcased the country's seasonal agriculture and communal activities have been largely replaced by modern forms of entertainment such as cinemas and music concerts. As a result, the younger generation can only learn about their ancestors' way of life through literature and images, which is a less immersive experience.Tradition plays a vital role in allowing individuals to reflect on the past, primarily through customary craftsmanship or antique lifestyles, in order to progress. By understanding how our predecessors overcame challenges, we can glean invaluable lessons that are applicable to our lives today. Furthermore, studying their mistakes can help us achieve our goals more efficiently.In conclusion, traditional skills and ways of life are irreplaceable. They serve as teachers, imparting self-esteem and experience, and thus, their preservation throughout history warrants our attention and effort.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";"The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a legal process where the state puts a person to death as a punishment for a crime. In recent years, many countries have abolished the death penalty, with 51% of countries worldwide and 98% of European countries having done so. Some argue that without the death penalty, our lives would be less secure and violent crimes would increase. However, others claim that it is not necessary to control violence in society through capital punishment. Personally, I believe that there is no evidence to suggest that the death penalty reduces crime rates, and I will outline my reasons below.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge that perpetuates a culture of violence. While it is illegal to kill someone, the government uses the law to punish them in the same way, essentially sanctioning a ""legalized revenge"" that fails to control violence in society or create a more peaceful culture. In fact, capital punishment can be seen as a repetition of the same violent act, only this time carried out by the state.Secondly, no one has the right to take another human life. The right to life is a fundamental and essential human right, and it is undeniable that no one, including the state, has the right to take a life, regardless of the circumstances. If we condone killing as a means of punishment, we become complicit in the same act of violence. Moreover, if we believe that killing is an acceptable solution, it raises serious ethical and moral concerns. In short, capital punishment can actually contribute to an increase in violent crimes.Finally, for some serious criminals, capital punishment can be seen as an easy way out. Instead of undergoing punishment and rehabilitation for their crimes, they are put to death without having to face the consequences of their actions. This can be seen as a lenient punishment, as they do not have to endure any pain or misery. Why not consider alternative punishments that are more meaningful and beneficial to society? For example, offenders could be made to work in industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, or reclamation, as a form of restitution. Additionally, rehabilitation and education can be effective ways to prevent or minimize offensive acts.In conclusion, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, an easy way out for serious criminals, and a violation of the fundamental human right to life. It neither deters violent crimes nor is essential to control violence in society. The world should carefully consider abolishing the death penalty and exploring"
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;The zoo has long served as a sanctuary for endangered species, providing them with a safe and nurturing environment. While some individuals may view the existence of zoos as insignificant, I firmly believe that they warrant maintenance and public respect for two primary reasons.Firstly, zoos play a vital role in education, offering a unique platform for learners to engage with living creatures and gain hands-on experience. By observing animals such as lions and crocodiles in their naturalistic habitats, students can develop a deeper understanding of their behavior, habits, and instincts. Moreover, universities can leverage zoos as a valuable resource for biological research, providing students with access to practical data, live recordings, and observational studies that would be difficult to conduct in the wild. This, in turn, facilitates the acquisition of knowledge at various academic levels.Secondly, zoos serve as a crucial means of ecological conservation. The increasing encroachment of natural habitats due to globalization, coupled with the alarming rate of hunting and poaching, has put rare and endangered species at risk. Zoos offer a safe haven for these animals, providing them with a protected territory where they can thrive. Species such as giraffes, pandas, koalas, and leopards, which are often targeted by poachers, can find refuge in zoos, where they are shielded from harm and allowed to flourish.In conclusion, the importance of zoos to both humans and animals is undeniable. To maximize their potential, it is essential to view zoos from a fresh perspective, recognizing their value as institutions that not only promote education and conservation but also safeguard the well-being of endangered species. By doing so, we can ensure that zoos continue to function at their highest efficiency, providing a vital service to both the environment and society.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";"It is undeniable that the growing number of endangered languages has become a pressing concern in today's society. The question of whether governments should invest in preserving these minority languages is still a topic of debate. In my opinion, every language, regardless of its popularity, deserves protection from extinction.There are valid arguments that suggest preserving regional languages may be a waste of resources. Firstly, expanding the use of these languages can be costly, as it would require significant investments in educational programs to teach and promote their use among young people. For instance, in certain areas of Southern Vietnam, the local government has faced significant expenses in hiring language teachers, building facilities, and developing materials to help secondary school students from the Khmer community learn their native language in addition to Vietnamese. Secondly, using a single language can facilitate communication, trade, cooperation, and transactions, making it easier for society to function as a whole.Despite these arguments, I firmly believe that governments should prioritize preserving minority languages. Language is more than just a means of communication; it is a valuable aspect of a community's heritage, forged over thousands of years. As such, it deserves respect and preservation. Moreover, language is a key factor in creating cultural diversity and uniqueness. Preserving minority languages is, therefore, essential to maintaining cultural diversity.In conclusion, although allowing minority languages to become extinct may seem beneficial in some aspects, it would have severe consequences, particularly in the loss of cultural heritage. It is crucial to recognize the importance of linguistic diversity and take steps to preserve it for future generations."
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The age-old adage in medicine, ""Prevention is better than cure,"" has sparked debate about whether governments should dedicate a significant portion of the national health budget to promoting health education and preventative measures. In my view, implementing this plan is justified for two key reasons.Firstly, incorporating health education into school curricula, particularly at the primary level, is crucial for raising awareness about healthy habits. By teaching children about balanced diets, nutritious foods, and harmful substances, they can develop a foundational understanding of how to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, it is easier for young people to form healthy habits, such as limiting their consumption of fast food, fried food, and intoxicants, which can have a lasting impact.Secondly, investing in preventative measures can have significant economic benefits by reducing the incidence of certain diseases. It is well-known that treating illnesses like cancer or HIV can be extremely costly, with the primary goal of extending the patient's life by only a few years. Similarly, regular physical activity, outdoor exercises, or the use of health-care products can prevent obesity, myopia, and other conditions that require expensive treatments, thereby reducing the financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system.In conclusion, I firmly believe in the benefits of shifting the focus from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This approach will not only yield positive results for people's physical and mental development but also have a positive impact on their financial well-being."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;University is a gateway to life, providing us with a foundation of wisdom and virtue that enables us to succeed. The significance of university raises an important question: do only students with exceptional academic performance deserve to attend university, or should it be accessible to any young person with a desire to learn? To answer this, we must consider both perspectives before reaching a conclusion.On one hand, students with outstanding academic records are well-suited for university due to their intellectual abilities. They can easily absorb complex information, which may be overwhelming for those with lesser skills. It is also true that individuals deserve the opportunities they have earned through hard work. University can be seen as a reward for those who have made significant efforts to achieve academic excellence.On the other hand, university is not solely focused on academic studies, but also provides a platform for nurturing artistic talents and developing essential life skills. Therefore, it should be accessible to a broader range of young people who wish to pursue their passions and develop holistically.Furthermore, restricting university access to only the most academically gifted individuals may lead to an increase in social problems. Those who are denied access to university may become disheartened, and those who lack necessary preparations may be more likely to struggle with job applications, particularly in professional fields.In conclusion, while restricting university access has both advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the negative consequences would outweigh the positive ones. Therefore, university education should be made available to a diverse range of learners, providing opportunities for growth and development to all who seek them.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;The debate about who is better suited to provide children's education, parents or teachers, has sparked significant social concern. Children typically have two primary influencers in their lives: their parents and teachers, both of whom play crucial roles in their development. From my perspective, I concur with the notion that teachers are often the more suitable option for children's education in several respects.Firstly, school teachers possess a higher level of qualification in the educational field compared to parents. The process of becoming a certified teacher involves years of theoretical training, equipping them with the knowledge necessary to educate children effectively. In contrast, parents often lack the specialized knowledge required to teach complex subjects such as mathematics and physics, making teachers more adept at providing a comprehensive education.Moreover, teaching professionals are skilled and experienced in fostering children's communication skills. With years of teaching experience, educators develop the ability to guide children in acquiring vital life skills, including understanding personal boundaries, coping with future challenges, and resolving conflicts effectively. Conversely, parents often face a generational gap that hinders their ability to manage family conflicts efficiently, as they may not be as adept at handling modern issues or communicating effectively with their children.Lastly, parents are constrained by limited time to dedicate to their children's education. The current global economic climate necessitates dual incomes, resulting in parents having restricted time to teach and guide their children. This constraint makes it challenging for parents to fulfill the role of a teacher adequately.In conclusion, teachers are paramount for children's education. They not only contribute significantly to the development of children's professional skills but also instruct them in essential social communication techniques necessary to thrive in today's competitive world. The specialized training, experience, and available time that teachers have make them better suited to provide the comprehensive education that children require.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;As the physical demands of human life continue to rise, salary has become a dominant factor in shaping career choices. However, I believe that other aspects should be considered equally important as income when selecting a profession. In the following paragraphs, I will outline and analyze my perspectives on this matter.On the one hand, I acknowledge that money is crucial for meeting basic human needs. Many people opt for high-paying jobs to support themselves and their families, covering essential expenses such as food, clothing, housing, education, and healthcare. Those working in creative fields like art or painting often struggle to make a comfortable living, despite doing what they love, due to relatively low incomes compared to other career paths.On the other hand, I firmly believe that passion for one's work can lead to effortless success. Numerous individuals who have achieved greatness in competitive fields like singing, dancing, and painting demonstrate this point. Additionally, factors like job satisfaction, personal relationships, professional skills, work environment, and interactions with managers and colleagues should not be underestimated when choosing a career. Some people even select a profession based on their desire to make a positive impact on their community and country.In conclusion, while income remains a vital consideration in career choices, I argue that passion for one's work can bring genuine happiness and lead to career advancement, ultimately resulting in higher earning potential.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The introduction of cars has undoubtedly brought about significant improvements to our lives. Nevertheless, the proliferation of private vehicles has exerted substantial pressure on the environment and economy, primarily due to excessive oil consumption. Although many advocate for imposing the highest taxes on petrol and diesel fuel, I strongly disagree with this proposition.It is undeniable that increasing petrol and fuel taxation could lead people to reconsider owning a personal vehicle. Higher taxes might mitigate environmental concerns by encouraging individuals to opt for public transportation, such as trains, buses, or ferries. Moreover, existing car owners may be deterred from using their vehicles for long journeys or in congested cities.However, increasing taxation on combustible resources could have unintended consequences, potentially leading to inflation. To be precise, the more expensive petrol becomes, the higher the price of essential products like rice, meat, and vegetables. As a result, people may turn to cheaper alternatives, which could lead to an overabundance of goods and ultimately, economic instability.Another crucial consideration is that countries reliant on oil imports will become increasingly dependent on exporters, both politically and financially. If these countries were to reduce their oil support, other nations would be compelled to pay more and offer favorable policies in exchange. For instance, the United States recently withdrew its involvement in the Russian crisis largely due to its reliance on oil imports.In conclusion, higher fuel and petrol costs have both advantages and disadvantages. However, the drawbacks may outweigh the benefits, particularly with regards to economic and political issues. Therefore, it is advisable to explore alternative solutions to reduce the reliance on personal vehicles, rather than solely relying on taxation as a means to address environmental concerns.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The rising number of street criminals and the subsequent arming of police forces has become a pressing concern for many in today's society. Some individuals believe that this trend exacerbates and reflects the high level of violence in society. I concur with this perspective, and the following paragraphs will elucidate the specific reasons behind this agreement.Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge that the primary intention of arming police with guns or other legal weapons is to protect not only civilians but also themselves. However, the sophistication of modern criminals, who invest heavily in acquiring advanced weaponry to counter the police and further their illicit activities, poses a significant threat. Consequently, citizens are at risk of being accidentally shot by both police and offenders. Furthermore, the presence of guns on duty can lead to the destruction of public and private property, such as cars, houses, and streets. Therefore, a society where the police force is armed will inevitably be perceived as a highly violent one.Secondly, the arming of police forces is typically reserved for societies plagued by high crime rates. In such societies, both the populace and the police often encounter a diverse range of dangerous crimes, including theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, and arson. These crimes serve as compelling evidence of a society beset by a high level of violence.In conclusion, while the arming of police forces may be necessary, it is undeniable that it contributes to a higher level of violence. To mitigate this, the government should enforce strict laws regarding the carrying of weapons and provide police with professional training to minimize the risk of harm to civilians' lives. This dual approach can help balance the need for police protection with the need to reduce societal violence.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;The significance of technology in modern life cannot be overstated, as it has become an essential component in nearly every aspect of our daily lives. In the realm of education, technology is widely regarded as a tool that enhances students' academic performance. From my perspective, the two primary factors that contribute to students' progress through technology are its richness and convenience.Firstly, the introduction of technology has exposed students to a vast array of information, thereby broadening their horizons. The internet, for instance, offers a plethora of knowledge in various forms such as news articles, podcasts, and research papers on diverse fields. This enables students not only to gain insight into specific subjects but also to access relevant issues and engage in discussions with individuals globally.Furthermore, technology facilitates a more efficient learning process for students. The advent of modern gadgets such as MP3 players, mobile phones, and laptops allows learners, particularly language students, to listen to recordings or read documents at their convenience. Consequently, students can develop their skills at an accelerated pace. Additionally, the internet serves as an inexhaustible source of visual aids like educational games, sounds, and images, which can help students grasp abstract concepts taught in school more quickly and comprehensively.In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the integration of technology in education, as it enhances data accessibility and expedites the learning process. It is highly recommended that technology be applied in all aspects of life, as it promises a brighter future. By embracing technology, we can unlock new opportunities for growth and development, ultimately leading to improved outcomes in education and beyond.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The impact of technological advancements on human life is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people argue that the drawbacks of technological development outweigh its benefits, I firmly believe that the advantages of technology far surpass its disadvantages. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives on this issue and provide explanations for my stance.On the one hand, it is evident that modern technology has revolutionized human life, making it more comfortable and convenient. Recent inventions such as air conditioners, computers, cellphones, and washing machines have significantly reduced stress and saved time, allowing people to engage in other activities. Furthermore, the application of technological science in medication production has played a crucial role in saving countless lives. These innovations have dramatically improved the quality of human life, and their benefits cannot be overstated.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge the negative consequences of technological advancements. The production process of technological products has indirectly devastated the natural environment, as the exploitation and collection of raw materials and fuels have caused significant harm to the ecosystem. Additionally, over-reliance on technology may stifle creativity in certain individuals, particularly children and young people, who may become too dependent on existing achievements.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology has made a profound contribution to human life and civilization. While its adverse effects cannot be ignored, I think that they can be mitigated with reasonable control and management. Ultimately, the benefits of technological progress far outweigh its drawbacks, and it is our responsibility to harness its potential to improve human life and preserve the environment for future generations.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The issue of excessive violence in television programs has been a pressing concern for society. The majority of governments worldwide agree that reducing violent content in TV shows is the best solution. In my opinion, governments should minimize violent elements in children's programming, while allowing mature audiences to watch TV shows with violent content. Reducing violent content in TV shows could lead to a decrease in the overall crime rate, but to effectively address this issue, governments should first ban violent content from all children's television programs. Due to their mental immaturity, children often struggle to distinguish right from wrong, making them more susceptible to the negative influences of violent TV programs and videos. As a result, they may become aggressive and prone to committing crimes. Therefore, it is essential for governments to establish strict laws that prevent minors from watching violent and brutal TV shows and movies.However, implementing such restrictions on TV shows and movies intended for mature audiences would be an infringement on adults' civil liberties. Many adults watch horror movies or war films as a way to unwind after a busy day, and these forms of entertainment are a legitimate source of relaxation for them. Since mature audiences are capable of taking responsibility for their actions, they should have the right to choose what they watch. In conclusion, I firmly believe that violent content should be eliminated from children's programming to reduce juvenile delinquency. Nevertheless, adults should not be unfairly restricted by such policies, and their freedom to choose their entertainment should be respected.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The rate of crime is increasing rapidly worldwide, sparking debate about the underlying causes. Some people argue that the use of guns by police is a primary contributor to this trend. However, I disagree with this assertion and believe that other factors play a more significant role in the escalating violence.On the one hand, I acknowledge that police officers have a responsibility to combat violence in urban and suburban areas, and the use of guns can be a necessary tool in achieving this goal. For instance, in the United States, a gunman killed over ten people in a cinema, and the police were able to apprehend him by shooting him in the foot, thereby preventing further harm. The presence of guns can indeed deter criminals and protect the public. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that some military-grade weapons should be made available to police officers to ensure public safety and minimize violence.On the other hand, there are several reasons why violence is on the rise in communities. Firstly, the unemployment rate has soared to 15% in many countries, leaving numerous well-qualified and educated individuals without a stable income. As a result, many people struggle to make ends meet, and some may turn to crime out of desperation. Secondly, the high cost of living in large cities can be overwhelming, pushing those living below the poverty line to engage in illicit activities to survive. For example, some individuals may resort to pickpocketing in public transportation.In conclusion, it appears to me that the use of guns by police is not the primary driver of increased violence. Rather, underlying issues such as unemployment and poverty are more significant contributors to crime. In my opinion, addressing the root cause of unemployment is crucial to reducing crime rates and creating a safer society.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";It is undeniable that a student's success is not solely their own achievement. Rather, it is the result of various external factors that contribute to their accomplishments. While some argue that parents play the most significant role in a child's success, I firmly believe that classmates have a more profound impact on an individual's achievements.Firstly, classmates create a competitive environment that motivates students to excel. For instance, in a high school setting, when surrounded by ambitious peers who strive to attend prestigious universities worldwide, an individual is driven to study diligently and persistently. From a psychological standpoint, the feeling of being outperformed by their peers exerts immense pressure, which ultimately serves as a stimulant, enhancing their academic performance.Furthermore, classmates are unparalleled when it comes to knowledge sharing and acquisition. Students spend more time with their peers than with their parents, which enables them to absorb a significant amount of wisdom from one another. This includes lessons learned in class, social skills, and etiquette that may be overlooked by parents. As classmates are of the same age, they feel comfortable exchanging ideas, asking questions, and interpreting complex concepts without the fear of parental reprimand, resulting in a deeper understanding.Considering all the advantages, classmates surpass parents as the primary influence on a child's success. They provide immense motivation and broaden one's horizon, two essential elements that lead to a successful academic experience. In conclusion, the impact of classmates on an individual's achievements cannot be overstated, and their role in shaping a student's academic journey is unparalleled.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;As the trend of urbanization continues, an increasing number of people are relocating to large cities to reside. Nevertheless, despite the benefits of city living, I strongly argue that the health of individuals is severely impacted in a negative manner.One of the primary factors contributing to the deterioration of city life is environmental pollution. The exhaust emitted by vehicles, particularly cars, and the toxic fumes released by factories are leading causes of respiratory diseases. Furthermore, water pollution poses a significant threat to public health, as the presence of harmful bacteria and germs in contaminated water can indirectly enter the human body, resulting in severe health problems that can be fatal if left untreated.In addition to environmental concerns, the food available in big cities is often not safe for consumption. Recent investigations have revealed that toxic food products are widely sold in the market. Overpopulation also increases the risk of infectious diseases, such as those caused by coughing, sneezing, and other illnesses. Living in large cities also means residing in areas with high crime rates, where unemployed individuals and school dropouts may turn to petty offenses or serious crimes like burglary, pickpocketing, and even murder. As a result, earning a living becomes more challenging, and maintaining good health in such environments becomes increasingly difficult.In conclusion, I firmly believe that residing in big cities can have detrimental effects on people's health. Therefore, it is essential that both the government and individuals take proactive measures to mitigate the negative consequences associated with urban living.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The notion that permitting police officers to carry firearms will lead to an increase in societal violence is a notion that some individuals may support. However, I partially disagree with this statement, as I firmly believe that the root cause of violence lies in the criminal mindset, rather than in the lack of stringent gun control laws.At first glance, it appears logical that imposing gun control measures would result in a decrease in crime rates, given that fewer available guns would presumably lead to fewer criminal incidents. Nevertheless, this issue is more complex than it initially seems.In reality, stringent gun control regulations do not necessarily lead to a reduction in violence and crime. This is because the majority of gun-related violence is committed using illegally obtained firearms. Individuals intent on perpetrating crimes and exerting control over cities through gang violence and other means will continue to find ways to access and utilize guns, regardless of the gun control laws in place.Furthermore, there will always be individuals, whether they be police officers or ordinary citizens, who refuse to abide by the law. Consequently, the primary cause of violence lies not in the weapon itself, but rather in the criminal mindset. Therefore, if a government aims to effectively control crime within a community, it is essential to focus on managing the actions of its citizens, rather than solely concentrating on the guns used in violent crimes.In conclusion, it is evident that there is no direct correlation between police officers carrying guns and an increase in violence rates. On the other hand, the criminal mindset appears to be more closely linked to violence. As a result, it is crucial that we shift our attention towards modifying people's behaviors in order to effectively reduce crime rates, rather than relying solely on gun control measures.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;Education is undeniably a vital economic necessity, with most countries allocating a significant portion of their national budget to it each year. In highly industrialized nations, efforts are made to ensure that education is accessible and affordable to all citizens. I firmly believe that education is the most crucial factor in a country's development.However, in developing countries, many families struggle to afford schooling for their children. While government schools with minimal tuition fees do exist, they are scarce and often located in urban areas, making them inaccessible to children from rural or island communities. These children, whose parents work as farmers or fishermen, often go without basic necessities, let alone being able to afford daily transportation to school. As a result, they remain uneducated and are likely to follow in their parents' footsteps.Education-driven development is not solely about producing a nation of doctors, lawyers, or engineers. Basic education provides individuals with fundamental skills like reading and writing, while supplementary education offers useful knowledge and information. Further specialized education can equip individuals with the skills necessary to earn a living and become self-sufficient. An informed and educated person is capable of making sensible decisions and sound judgments, ultimately contributing positively to society. Collectively, the benefits of education can empower individuals, societies, and countries as a whole.In conclusion, education plays a pivotal role in determining a country's socioeconomic status. The more educated the population, the greater the country's chances of development and growth. As such, it is essential to prioritize education and make it accessible to all, regardless of geographical location or socioeconomic background, to unlock the full potential of a country and its people.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";"Some argue that adolescents are being negatively influenced by individuals who gain fame solely due to their wealth and luxurious lifestyle. However, I partially disagree with this assertion.On one hand, it is undeniable that individuals who use their wealth to gain fame are not ideal role models for young people. We do not want our children to emulate someone solely based on their extravagant lifestyle, especially when such individuals lack talent and instead focus on showcasing their wealth. Nevertheless, the current young generation is remarkably aware of positive lifestyles. From a young age, children are educated by their families and schools to discern what is beneficial for them, making them well-equipped with life skills and less susceptible to negative influences.On the other hand, it appears that few individuals can achieve celebrity status without any notable talents or achievements. With the proliferation of talent shows like The Voice, X Factor, and Next Top Models, numerous teenagers are given the opportunity to showcase their intelligence and skills. Consequently, to become a star and an inspiration to others, one must possess genuine talent to compete with fellow contestants. Therefore, mere wealth and glamour are no longer sufficient for achieving recognition; individuals must also demonstrate tangible achievements to be considered a positive influence on youngsters.In conclusion, individuals lacking talent are unlikely to gain fame in today's world, and to be respected, they must contribute positively to the young generation. This is why many celebrities nowadays have a more positive influence on young people than they did in the past."
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The increasing use of mobile phones has sparked a social concern about their potential negative impact on our social lives. Despite their widespread adoption across all age groups, I firmly believe that this 21st-century innovation poses significant problems for our society.Firstly, excessive mobile phone use can have a detrimental effect on our social skills. For instance, teenagers who spend too much time on their phones may lose interest in everyday activities like socializing with friends, which can impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Prolonged mobile phone use can also lead to eye damage and poor physical posture in children. Consequently, frequent mobile phone use is harmful to our well-being.Moreover, the rising number of mobile games can hinder mental development. Many online game applications feature aggressive content, where children are rewarded for engaging in violent behavior, such as killing or shooting monsters or other players' characters. This can foster aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, leading to increased conflict during communication.On the other hand, mobile phones, particularly smartphones, have made communication more accessible and convenient. With telecommunication companies providing internet access via mobile phones, people can enjoy free instant messaging and international calls. This has effectively shortened the distance between individuals and facilitated global communication.In conclusion, while mobile phones have accelerated communication, they also contribute to various social problems, including the erosion of children's social skills and mental health. Therefore, I strongly advocate for moderate mobile phone use to mitigate these serious issues. By using mobile phones responsibly, we can harness their benefits while minimizing their negative consequences.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;In recent years, environmental issues have become a pressing concern for many countries. Some argue that the responsibility for protecting the environment lies solely with governments and large corporations, leaving ordinary citizens with no role to play. However, I believe that both governments and individuals share a responsibility to protect the environment, and it's essential to examine specific situations to understand the complexities involved.On the one hand, addressing certain environmental problems requires significant financial resources and advanced technologies, which governments and corporations are better equipped to handle. For instance, issues like air pollution and water quality are of great concern to many countries, and governments have the capacity to implement policies and invest in measures to reduce air pollution. Similarly, companies can leverage their technological capabilities to minimize the emission of pollutants and contaminants. Individuals, on the other hand, are limited in their ability to tackle these issues alone.Moreover, governments and corporations have a substantial influence on promoting environmental awareness among the public. It's crucial for every citizen to possess a basic understanding of environmental protection and the importance of conserving natural resources. This entails disseminating relevant policies and knowledge to the public through various media channels, such as television and newspapers, which are largely controlled by the government.On the other hand, ordinary citizens can make a meaningful contribution to environmental conservation. By adopting environmentally friendly habits in their daily lives, individuals can significantly impact the environment. For example, reducing the use of private cars can decrease air pollution, and minimizing the use of plastic packaging can mitigate the harm caused to the environment. If people can gradually modify their lifestyles and daily habits, this can have a profound impact on environmental improvement.In conclusion, while governments and corporations should bear a greater responsibility for addressing environmental issues, ordinary citizens also have a vital role to play in protecting the environment. By working together, we can achieve significant progress in mitigating environmental problems and promoting a more sustainable future.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;In recent times, the media, both print and electronic, have been devoting extensive coverage to detailed crime reports. In my opinion, such content should be heavily censored, if not completely banned.It is common knowledge that the media exploits criminal stories to boost newspaper sales and TV ratings. The primary objective of journalists covering crime stories has shifted from informing the public to increasing circulation and viewership. As a result, crime coverage is often biased, exaggerated, or even fabricated, which serves only to frighten communities and leave law-abiding citizens increasingly anxious about crime.Moreover, the detailed reports of crimes in the media can provide potential criminals with valuable information and insights that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. This can enable individuals planning a crime to refine their plans, avoid mistakes, and evade detection by the authorities. Without restrictions on crime reporting, unlawful behavior may escalate, and social harmony may be disrupted.Most concerning is the potential impact of coverage of heinous crimes on the victims themselves. Such reporting can re-traumatize victims who have already suffered greatly, and without their consent, it can exacerbate their mental anguish, potentially leading to extreme actions.In conclusion, I firmly believe that crime descriptions should no longer go unregulated, as they can be misleading, contribute to the already high crime rate, and inflict additional suffering on crime victims. Strict censorship is necessary to prevent the harmful consequences of unrestrained crime reporting.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In today's digital age, many people often overlook the significance of teaching handwriting to children, viewing it as a tedious and time-consuming task. However, I firmly believe that children require instruction in handwriting for several compelling reasons.Despite the ease and convenience offered by modern technology, handwriting remains a crucial aspect of the learning process for students. Firstly, it serves as a fundamental tool for various academic activities such as note-taking, homework, and writing. Handwriting helps improve learners' spelling abilities and can aid in overcoming reading and writing difficulties. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can reap the benefits of practicing handwriting, which encourages them to focus on content, elaborate on details, and develop their organizational skills.Secondly, parents and schools should prioritize teaching children handwriting skills, as poor handwriting can have a detrimental impact on students' academic performance. Students who struggle with handwriting often face difficulties in taking notes and keeping up with lessons, leading to a lack of information and detail in their work. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on advanced technology can make students complacent and less diligent in their writing skills. For instance, the automatic grammar and spelling checks available in word processing software can lead to a lack of attention to mistakes, as learners no longer need to be vigilant about their errors.In conclusion, regardless of the speed and convenience offered by modern devices, handwriting remains an essential skill for everyone, particularly students at a young age. It is crucial that we recognize the importance of handwriting and continue to teach and promote this valuable skill to future generations.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";Some individuals who opt for private education for their children argue that the taxes they pay towards state education are excessive and unreasonable. However, I firmly believe that these taxes are crucial and serve a vital purpose.First and foremost, affluent individuals who pay taxes for public schools play a significant role in bridging the socio-economic gap between the rich and the poor. Many low-income families struggle to afford tuition fees, and the taxes paid by the wealthy help support a large number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, enabling them to pursue their education and improve their quality of life.Furthermore, exempting parents of private school students from paying these taxes would result in a misallocation of public funds. The complexities of tax calculations would require the government to hire additional staff, leading to unnecessary expenditures on salaries for these officials. This, in turn, would divert essential investments away from critical public sectors such as education and healthcare.Proponents of tax discounts for private school parents claim that it is unfair to expect them to pay for services they do not utilize. Nevertheless, this argument is flawed, as we also pay for public services like law enforcement and fire departments, which we may not directly use. We do not advocate for tax reductions in these areas, and the same logic should apply to education.In conclusion, I strongly advocate for making taxes that support state schools compulsory for all members of society, regardless of where their children are enrolled. This is essential for maintaining a fair and equitable education system that benefits the community as a whole.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;There is a prevailing view that the government should prioritize investing in public services over the arts, such as music and theater. However, from my perspective, I believe that both public services and the arts are worthy of investment.It is self-evident that essential public services like hospitals and schools are worth every penny invested. Investing in hospitals improves public health, while investing in schools enhances the education level of our children. Clearly, if these facilities are not adequately funded, our standard of living would decline.However, our standard of living also depends on another crucial factor: our spiritual well-being, which is closely tied to the arts. The arts encompass various forms, and music and cinema are among the most prominent. These art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also make significant contributions to the economy. The film and music industries generate millions of dollars in revenue for the government each year, with examples including K-pop and Hollywood. These industries cannot survive without government financial support.In conclusion, both the arts and public services are vital to the community and should be invested in properly. A balanced approach that allocates funds to both areas is essential to maintain a high standard of living and foster a thriving cultural and economic environment.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;In recent years, technology has undergone significant advancements, profoundly impacting various aspects of our lives. Although some people believe that technological progress leads to a loss of traditional cultures, I argue that while technology's influence on culture is undeniable, it has also played a crucial role in preserving traditional cultures.The advent of modern technology has greatly improved our lives, introducing numerous innovative gadgets. The invention of mobile phones and the internet has revolutionized our traditional communication and work methods, making them less labor-intensive with the aid of electrical machinery. However, these new technologies have replaced many traditional practices. For instance, factories equipped with modern, highly productive systems have supplanted handmade products, and the exchange of letters among friends has become rare with the advent of emails and social networks. Moreover, new video games have replaced traditional physical ones, leading to the decline of many cultural traditions.Nevertheless, despite these drawbacks, technology has also contributed to the preservation and study of traditional cultures in several ways. The internet has enabled young generations to access and learn about the cultural identities of nations worldwide. Advanced methods have facilitated the restoration and preservation of numerous art masterpieces. Additionally, modern devices have assisted scientists in studying ancient societies more in-depth, leading to the discovery of more cultural artifacts.In conclusion, modern technology has had both positive and negative impacts on traditional cultures. While it has contributed to the decline of some cultural practices, it has also played a vital role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The idea that universities and colleges should have an equal number of male and female students in each faculty is a topic of debate. However, I disagree with this perspective because of the inherent differences between male and female students.On the one hand, males and females exhibit distinct psychological modes and individualities. Generally, male students tend to be more rational and logical, often relying on their left brain to think and act. This is reflected in the fact that there are more male scientists and engineers globally compared to females. Many boys are drawn to science and technology, whereas girls often prefer subjects like literature, education, and arts. Additionally, girls are more inclined towards professions that involve emotion and communication, such as teaching, singing, and interpreting. This highlights significant differences in mindset and behavior between boys and girls, with each exceling in specific areas.Furthermore, enforcing equal gender proportions in each subject could have a negative impact on students. Forcing them to choose subjects that do not align with their personality traits and mental development could be detrimental. For instance, a girl interested in literature who is placed in an engineering department may struggle to focus, potentially hindering her future development and career prospects.On the other hand, universities should encourage girls to pursue science subjects and boys to study humanities, which could help mitigate gender imbalances in certain fields. Studying in a single-gender environment could also affect students' mental health. In conclusion, it is essential for universities to respect individual subject choices, acknowledging the diversity between males and females. We cannot forcibly assign equal numbers of males and females to every subject, as this disregards the unique preferences and strengths of each gender.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;"The lives of celebrities, such as movie stars, are often showcased in the media as lavish and exciting, complete with luxurious lifestyles and high-profile relationships. It's only natural that people, especially young fans, are drawn to their favorite celebrities, which is why the media tends to prioritize covering their latest news and updates. However, I believe this trend has a detrimental impact on children.The glamorous image of celebrities can create a misleading impression that wealth and success come easily, without the need for hard work or dedication. This can lead children to underestimate the importance of studying hard and striving for a successful career. Furthermore, they may develop a sense of entitlement and fail to appreciate the value of other people's efforts.Moreover, not all celebrities set a good example. The media often reports on celebrities engaging in problematic behavior, such as crime, substance abuse, or scandalous personal lives. Without proper guidance, children may mistakenly perceive this as the epitome of a ""cool"" lifestyle.On the other hand, some celebrities, like writers and passionate entrepreneurs, can be positive role models for children. They share inspiring stories and demonstrate the value of pursuing meaningful goals and making a positive impact on the world.In conclusion, I think the media should shift its focus away from celebrity coverage and towards more positive and uplifting content. Additionally, children's access to celebrity news should be limited, and they should only be exposed to celebrities who promote positive values and behaviors. By doing so, we can help children develop a more balanced and realistic understanding of what it means to be successful and happy."
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In the modern era, the notion of a welfare state mandates that governments provide their citizens with access to sustainable healthcare and health education. I strongly endorse the idea that governments should allocate a larger share of their healthcare budgets towards health education and preventive measures.There are several compelling reasons why education and prevention should receive greater funding. Firstly, investing in health education and preventive measures can significantly enhance the overall healthcare system. By educating the public about health issues, individuals can take proactive steps to prevent illnesses, thereby reducing the number of patients seeking medical attention. This, in turn, enables hospitals and healthcare centers to manage their resources more efficiently, resulting in better treatment outcomes for current patients. By promoting health awareness and preventive measures, society can effectively reduce the burden on the healthcare system.Secondly, prioritizing health education and prevention is essential for the overall welfare of society. I firmly believe that health is the most vital aspect of a person's life, and it is the foundation upon which happiness and well-being are built. Therefore, it is the government's responsibility to provide the necessary resources and initiatives that empower citizens to take control of their health and prevent illnesses that can lead to suffering. For instance, the Turkish Ministry of Health's anti-smoking campaign, which targeted young people, led to improved well-being among those who quit smoking and adopted healthier lifestyles after the campaign.In conclusion, a larger proportion of the healthcare budget should be dedicated to education and prevention rather than treatment. This approach will not only lead to a more effective healthcare system but also contribute to a greater level of well-being among citizens. By prioritizing health education and prevention, governments can make a significant positive impact on the lives of their citizens, ultimately creating a healthier and happier society.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;In today's society, raising children is a challenging task for families, the fundamental units of society. While the mother's role is crucial in a child's life, I strongly agree that fatherhood is just as vital as motherhood in ensuring a healthy upbringing. The first reason why fathers should have an equal role to mothers is the nature of parenthood itself. In my opinion, the role models within a family significantly influence the development of a child's characteristics. For instance, in traditional Turkish families, mothers often provide a nurturing and thoughtful approach, while fathers are expected to be authoritative and conversational, creating a well-balanced and well-behaved child. The second reason I believe fatherhood is as important as motherhood is the evolving dynamics of relationships in modern society. We live in a society that values gender equality in all aspects of life, including relationships. The traditional family model, where the woman is a homemaker and the man is the breadwinner, is no longer prevalent. Instead, couples share and interchange responsibilities equally. Therefore, I believe that childcare and parenting should be viewed as a shared responsibility, similar to any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be equally present as motherhood in a child's life, starting from birth, to provide balanced parenthood and promote healthy family relationships. By recognizing the importance of equal parental involvement, we can work towards creating a more supportive and equitable environment for children to grow and thrive.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;There is an ongoing debate about the importance of studying hard versus playing sports for children. Some people believe that studying hard is the key to a successful future, while others think that playing sports is a waste of time. However, I firmly believe that both studying hard and playing sports are essential parts of a child's life.On one hand, studying hard is crucial for a child's future. It provides them with a wealth of knowledge and skills that will benefit them in their future careers. As children grow up and enter the workforce, their academic achievements will play a significant role in determining their job prospects. For instance, children who consistently study hard and achieve high grades will find it easier to meet the qualifications for their desired jobs and are more likely to secure positions at prestigious multinational companies, which often offer higher salaries. The message is clear: hard work and dedication to studies will yield the best results.On the other hand, playing sports has numerous benefits for children. Popular sports like football, basketball, and volleyball can have a positive impact on their lives. Firstly, participating in team sports like football teaches children the value of teamwork and socialization. By working together towards a common goal, children learn essential life skills like communication, cooperation, and mutual respect, which enable them to build strong friendships and contribute positively to their communities. Secondly, playing sports promotes physical health and well-being in children, which is essential for their overall development.In conclusion, both studying hard and playing sports are vital for a child's future. By striking a balance between academic rigor and physical activity, children can develop into well-rounded individuals with a strong foundation for success in their future endeavors.
