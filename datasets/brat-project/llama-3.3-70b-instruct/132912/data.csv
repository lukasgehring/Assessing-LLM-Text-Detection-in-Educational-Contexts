0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The Role of Competition and Cooperation in Promoting Economic Development and Interpersonal SkillsCompetition has long been regarded as a driving force behind economic growth and development. It stimulates innovation, encourages efficiency, and promotes the production of high-quality goods and services. By creating a competitive market environment, businesses are motivated to improve their products, reduce costs, and expand their customer base, ultimately leading to increased economic activity and prosperity. In this sense, competition can effectively promote the development of the economy by fostering an environment of continuous improvement and innovation.However, when discussing the issue of competition versus cooperation, our focus shifts from the broader societal and economic benefits to the individual, particularly in the context of children's development. While competition can be beneficial in certain contexts, as mentioned, cooperation plays a more critical role in the development of essential interpersonal skills. Through cooperative activities, children learn valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, empathy, and conflict resolution. These skills are not only crucial for personal relationships but also highly valued in professional settings, where the ability to work collaboratively with others is increasingly recognized as a key factor in achieving success.In the context of students, learning through cooperation is particularly significant. It prepares them for future life by enhancing their ability to interact effectively with peers, build strong relationships, and contribute to group efforts towards common goals. Moreover, cooperative learning environments often promote a sense of community and mutual support, which can lead to improved academic performance and a more positive school experience. Therefore, while competition has its economic benefits, cooperation is indispensable for the development of interpersonal skills that are vital for the future success and well-being of students.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The last 50 years have witnessed a significant surge in immigration to other countries, resulting in the formation of diverse multicultural societies. As a consequence, the question of whether immigrants should adopt the local customs of their adopted countries has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that assimilating into the local culture is essential for integration, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, immigrants should be able to sustain their cultural identities, thereby preserving their origin values.Maintaining one's cultural identity is a crucial aspect of adapting to a new environment. By holding onto their cultural heritage, individuals can establish a sense of belonging and continuity, even in unfamiliar surroundings. This, in turn, enables them to navigate their new multicultural environment with greater ease and confidence. Moreover, preserving cultural identity allows immigrants to share their unique perspectives and customs with their adopted community, thereby enriching the cultural tapestry of their new home.Furthermore, sustaining cultural identity helps individuals to stay connected to their roots and upbringing, which is essential for their emotional and psychological well-being. It also facilitates the passing down of cultural traditions and values to future generations, ensuring that their heritage is not lost in the process of integration. In conclusion, the ability of immigrants to sustain their cultural identities is not only desirable but also essential for their successful integration into their adopted countries. By embracing their cultural diversity, immigrants can make valuable contributions to their new communities, while also preserving the values and traditions that are integral to their sense of self.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The last decade has witnessed a significant surge in international tourism, with travelers flocking to experience the world's most breathtaking natural wonders, ancient heritages, and diverse cultures. While some individuals may argue that this influx of tourists has detrimental effects on the destination countries, I firmly believe that it has had a profoundly positive impact. International tourism has not only contributed to the economic development of these nations but also played a crucial role in preserving their cultural heritage and environmental beauty.On the economic front, tourism has proven to be a lucrative industry, generating substantial revenue for local economies. The creation of jobs, infrastructure development, and influx of foreign currency have all contributed to the economic growth of these countries. Moreover, tourism has encouraged local entrepreneurship, with many small businesses and enterprises emerging to cater to the needs of visitors. This, in turn, has helped to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for local communities.In addition to its economic benefits, tourism has also been instrumental in preserving the cultural heritage of destination countries. By promoting and showcasing their unique traditions, customs, and historical landmarks, tourism has helped to raise awareness and appreciation for these cultural treasures. This has, in turn, encouraged local governments and communities to take steps to conserve and protect their cultural heritage for future generations. Furthermore, tourism has also prompted environmental conservation efforts, as countries seek to preserve their natural beauty and attractiveness for visitors. Overall, international tourism has been a driving force for economic development, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation, and its benefits will undoubtedly continue to be felt for years to come.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The last 50 years have witnessed a phenomenal surge in the number of tourists traveling worldwide. This rapid growth in tourism has brought about numerous benefits, including economic growth, cultural exchange, and job creation. However, the darker side of this phenomenon cannot be ignored. The influx of tourists has put immense pressure on the world's natural and cultural heritage sites, posing a significant threat to their preservation.Many of these sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef, the Grand Canyon, and the ancient city of Petra, are not only breathtakingly beautiful but also hold immense historical and cultural significance. They are a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of our ancestors and serve as a window into the past. Nevertheless, the sheer number of visitors has led to erosion, pollution, and degradation of these precious sites.If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future. The consequences of inaction will be catastrophic, resulting in the loss of irreplaceable cultural and natural assets. It is imperative that governments, tourism boards, and local communities work together to implement sustainable tourism practices, such as limiting visitor numbers, promoting eco-friendly accommodations, and supporting conservation efforts.Furthermore, it is essential to raise awareness among tourists about the importance of responsible travel and the need to respect local customs and environments. By taking proactive measures, we can ensure that these incredible sites are preserved for future generations to appreciate and enjoy. The time to act is now, and it is our collective responsibility to safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage for years to come. By doing so, we can strike a balance between tourism development and conservation, allowing these precious values to continue to inspire and awe us for centuries to come.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The decision to study abroad or at home is a crucial one for students, with some opting to remain in their home country due to the perceived difficulties of living and studying overseas. However, in my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many valuable skills throughout this experience for several compelling reasons.Firstly, studying abroad provides students with the opportunity to immerse themselves in a new culture, fostering cultural competency and understanding. By navigating everyday life in a foreign country, students develop essential life skills such as adaptability, resilience, and independence. These skills are invaluable in today's globalized world, where companies and organizations increasingly operate across international borders.Secondly, studying overseas exposes students to diverse perspectives and ways of thinking, broadening their intellectual horizons. Interacting with peers from different backgrounds encourages the exchange of ideas, promoting critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. This multicultural environment also enhances language skills, as students are compelled to communicate effectively in a foreign language, thereby improving their linguistic proficiency.Lastly, the experience of studying abroad equips students with a competitive edge in the job market. Employers often view international study experience as a significant asset, demonstrating a student's ability to thrive in challenging environments and adapt to new situations. This can lead to enhanced career opportunities and a stronger professional network, as students connect with like-minded individuals from around the globe.In conclusion, while the difficulties of living and studying overseas may deter some students, the benefits of this experience far outweigh the challenges. By studying abroad, students can acquire a unique set of skills that will serve them well throughout their personal and professional lives, making them more attractive to employers and better equipped to navigate an increasingly interconnected world.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;The experience of studying abroad is a highly rewarding and enriching one, offering students a wide range of benefits that extend far beyond the classroom. Students who embark on this journey gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally. On a personal level, living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. As students navigate unfamiliar customs, languages, and ways of life, they develop valuable skills such as resilience, independence, and self-reliance.Academically, the experience of studying abroad is also highly beneficial. Students have the opportunity to access new and innovative academic programs, taught by experienced and renowned faculty members. The new academic experience that students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies is unparalleled, providing them with a unique perspective and approach to learning. This, in turn, enhances their critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, making them more competitive and attractive to potential employers.Culturally, the experience of studying abroad is a chance for students to immerse themselves in a new and diverse cultural environment. They have the opportunity to engage with people from different backgrounds, learn new languages, and participate in local customs and traditions. This cross-cultural exchange broadens their understanding of the world, fosters global awareness, and helps to break down cultural stereotypes. Overall, the experience of studying abroad is a life-changing opportunity that offers students a chance to grow, learn, and develop in a holistic and multifaceted way. By embracing this experience, students can gain a competitive edge, develop valuable skills, and forge lifelong connections and memories.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way people access information, and its popularity has been on the rise in recent years. The internet has become a vast and unparalleled source of information, offering users a wide range of topics and updates at their fingertips. This has sparked a debate about the future of traditional newspapers, with some people believing they can still exist for a long time, while others disagree, arguing that they have lost their competitive advantage.Proponents of newspapers argue that they can coexist with the internet, providing in-depth analysis and high-quality content that is often lacking online. However, they are facing an uphill battle, as the internet has made it quicker and more convenient for people to obtain information. With just a few clicks, users can access a vast array of news articles, blogs, and social media platforms, making it easier to stay informed about current events. In contrast, newspapers require a physical trip to a store or a wait for delivery, making them seem slow and outdated by comparison.Moreover, the internet offers real-time updates, allowing users to stay abreast of breaking news as it happens. Newspapers, on the other hand, are often published on a daily or weekly basis, making their content seem stale and outdated. As a result, many people are turning to the internet as their primary source of information, leading some to argue that newspapers are no longer sustainable in the long term. While some may still value the traditional format of newspapers, it is clear that the internet has become the preferred method of obtaining information for many people, and its popularity is likely to continue growing in the future.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The importance of education in shaping a civilized society cannot be overstated. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring a country's long-lasting prosperity and growth. Education is the foundation upon which a nation's future is built, and it is imperative that governments prioritize investment in this sector. Both young children's education and university-level education are crucial components in the journey towards a brighter future.Young children's education lays the groundwork for their future academic and personal development. It is during these formative years that essential skills, values, and knowledge are imparted, setting the stage for a lifelong learning process. Conversely, universities are the hubs where future leaders, innovators, and thinkers are nurtured. They are instrumental in pushing the boundaries of human knowledge, driving innovation, and fostering a culture of intellectual curiosity and excellence.Some may argue that universities can support themselves well through donations or by leveraging their inventions and research outputs commercially. However, this argument is fundamentally flawed. While donations and commercial activities can provide supplementary funding, they are unreliable and insufficient to meet the comprehensive needs of a university. The core functions of a university, including research, teaching, and community engagement, require stable and significant financial investment. Moreover, relying solely on donations or commercial ventures could compromise the autonomy and academic integrity of universities, as they may feel pressured to prioritize research with immediate commercial potential over basic and foundational research that may have long-term, significant impacts.Therefore, it is the responsibility of governments to ensure that both young children's education and universities receive the necessary support. By investing in education, governments are essentially investing in their country's future. A well-educated population is better equipped to contribute to the economy, make informed decisions, and participate actively in the democratic process. In conclusion, the role of education in fostering a civilized and prosperous society is undeniable. Governments must spare no effort in supporting education at all levels to pave the way for a brighter, more sustainable future.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";The ideal roommate is a topic of much debate, with various qualities being touted as the most desirable. However, in my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considerate. A considerate roommate is one who respects the space, boundaries, and belongings of their fellow roommates. They are mindful of noise levels, clean up after themselves, and are generally aware of the impact their actions have on those around them. This quality is essential in creating a harmonious and comfortable living environment, where everyone feels valued and respected.In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Effective communication is key to resolving conflicts, addressing issues, and building a strong and supportive relationship with one's roommates. A good roommate should be able to express their needs, wants, and concerns in a clear and respectful manner, and be receptive to feedback and criticism. Open and honest communication helps to prevent misunderstandings, reduces tension, and fosters a sense of trust and cooperation among roommates.When considerateness and communication come together, they create a powerful foundation for a positive and successful roommate experience. A considerate and communicative roommate is one who is willing to listen, compromise, and work together to maintain a clean, comfortable, and enjoyable living space. They are also more likely to be respectful of differences, and to approach conflicts in a constructive and respectful manner. In conclusion, having a considerate and communicative roommate can make all the difference in creating a happy and harmonious home. By prioritizing these qualities, individuals can build strong and lasting relationships with their roommates, and create a living environment that is supportive, respectful, and enjoyable for all.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The investment in public transportation, as such buses, trains, and subways, is an issue that warrants serious consideration from governments worldwide. It is imperative that governments allocate a significant portion of their budget towards enhancing and expanding these modes of transportation. By doing so, they can effectively alleviate traffic congestion, a problem that plagues numerous cities globally. The benefits of investing in public transportation are multifaceted, with one of the most significant advantages being the reduction in the number of private vehicles on the road.The proliferation of cars and motorbikes on roads leads to a marked increase in carbon emissions, which in turn, causes irreparable damage to the ozone layer. The ozone layer, which protects the earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun, is depleting at an alarming rate due to the excessive release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This depletion has severe consequences, including the exacerbation of climate change and the increase in incidents of skin cancer among humans. Therefore, it is essential to minimize the reliance on private vehicles and encourage the use of public transportation.Investing in buses, trains, and subways can help achieve this goal. These modes of transportation can carry a large number of passengers, thereby reducing the number of private vehicles on the road. Furthermore, they are more environmentally friendly, as they release significantly less carbon per passenger than private cars. In conclusion, governments should prioritize the investment in public transportation to mitigate the problems of traffic congestion and environmental degradation. By doing so, they can create a sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation system that benefits both the citizens and the planet. This investment is not only a necessity but a responsibility that governments must undertake to ensure a livable future for generations to come.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";The correlation between physical exercise and overall health is undeniable. There exists a direct linkage between the frequency of engaging in physical activities and the improvement of one's health. The more we practice, the better we feel, both physically and mentally. Regular exercise not only enhances our physical well-being but also boosts our mood, reduces stress, and increases energy levels. This, in turn, leads to a better quality of life, allowing individuals to perform daily tasks with more vigor and efficiency.Moreover, participating in outdoor and indoor sports activities clarifies many aspects of life. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, including concentration, memory, and problem-solving skills. When we engage in physical activities, our minds become clearer, and we are able to approach challenges with a fresh perspective. This clarity of thought can have a positive impact on various areas of life, including work, relationships, and personal goals.The significance of a healthy population extends beyond individual benefits, as it also plays a crucial role in the financial sustainability of a region. A community with a high percentage of healthy individuals is more likely to be productive, innovative, and economically stable. When people are healthy, they are more likely to be employed, contribute to the economy, and pay taxes, which in turn, supports the financial well-being of the region. Conversely, a region with a predominantly unhealthy population may face increased healthcare costs, reduced productivity, and economic stagnation. Therefore, it is essential for individuals, communities, and governments to prioritize physical exercise and health promotion, as it has far-reaching benefits for both personal and regional prosperity. By incorporating regular physical activity into our lifestyles, we can create a healthier, more sustainable, and thriving society.

12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The impact of technology on children's creativity has been a topic of debate in recent years. While some people point out that technology has made children less creative, I don't entirely deny that technology may have some negative effects on children. However, it is essential to consider the other side of the coin, where technology plays a significant role in fostering creativity and expanding knowledge among children.On the one hand, technology inspires children to create new things. With the vast array of digital tools and software available, children can express themselves in various forms of art, music, and writing. For instance, interactive platforms and apps allow kids to create their own stories, animations, and games, thereby encouraging imagination and innovation. This creative outlet enables children to think outside the box and bring their ideas to life, which is a crucial aspect of the learning process.On the other hand, technology widens children's knowledge and broadens their perspectives. The internet provides an vast ocean of information, where children can explore and learn about different cultures, subjects, and topics. Online educational resources, such as interactive tutorials and videos, make complex concepts more engaging and accessible, thereby sparking children's curiosity and love for learning. Moreover, technology facilitates global connections, allowing children to collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds, share ideas, and gain new insights.In conclusion, while technology may have some drawbacks, its benefits in inspiring creativity and expanding knowledge among children cannot be overlooked. By leveraging technology in a balanced and responsible manner, we can unlock the full potential of children and empower them to become innovative thinkers, creative problem-solvers, and lifelong learners. Ultimately, technology can be a powerful tool in fostering the next generation of creative and informed individuals.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The debate about the effectiveness of traditional teaching methods versus self-directed learning has sparked a lot of discussion in recent years. Despite the rise of digital learning platforms and online resources, many people still believe that students at schools and universities learn more from lessons with teachers. This opinion is rooted in the idea that teachers play a crucial role in shaping the foundational skills of students, starting from a young age.From kindergarten onwards, teachers instruct students on essential skills such as writing, reading, and calculation. These fundamental skills are the building blocks of future academic success, and teachers are best equipped to provide personalized guidance and feedback to students. Moreover, teachers not only impart knowledge but also instill values and morals, helping students to distinguish between right and wrong. The influence of teachers extends beyond the classroom, as they often serve as role models and mentors, providing students with a sense of direction and purpose.Furthermore, the interactive nature of teacher-led lessons allows for a more engaging and immersive learning experience. Students can ask questions, participate in discussions, and receive immediate feedback, all of which are essential for reinforcing learning outcomes. In contrast, self-directed learning can lack the human element, leading to a more isolating and less effective learning experience. While digital resources can supplement learning, they cannot replace the value of a dedicated teacher who can adapt their teaching methods to meet the unique needs of their students. Ultimately, the benefits of traditional teaching methods, led by experienced and passionate teachers, cannot be overstated, and it is clear that students still learn much more from lessons with teachers.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has revolutionized the way people communicate, bringing about significant changes in the way we interact with each other. While these technological advancements have made communication faster and more convenient, they have also raised concerns about the potential decline of written language. Some people believe that the brevity and informality of email and text messaging may be contributing factors to the erosion of written language skills.The rise of abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons in digital communication has led to a decline in the use of proper grammar, syntax, and spelling. This has sparked fears that the written language is losing its nuance and complexity, as people rely more on shortcuts and less on thoughtful expression. Furthermore, the immediacy of digital communication can lead to a lack of reflection and editing, resulting in careless mistakes and a general decline in writing quality.However, it is essential that educators and individuals, particularly the youth, pay closer attention to this issue. As the primary users of digital communication, young people are most at risk of developing poor writing habits. Educators must emphasize the importance of proper writing skills, including grammar, syntax, and spelling, and encourage students to practice writing in a variety of contexts. Individuals must also take responsibility for their own writing development, recognizing that clear and effective communication is essential in all aspects of life.By acknowledging the potential risks of digital communication and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure that the written language remains a vibrant and expressive medium. Ultimately, the key to preserving the integrity of written language lies in striking a balance between the convenience of digital communication and the importance of thoughtful, well-crafted writing. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of technology while preserving the beauty and power of written language.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The use of animal experiments has become a highly debated topic in recent years. With the increasing numbers of experiments being conducted, particularly for the development of new medicines and foods, opinions on the matter are sharply divided. On one hand, some opponents argue that animal testing is cruel to animals and nature, disrupting the delicate balance of ecosystems. They claim that it is unethical to subject living beings to pain, suffering, and death in the name of scientific progress.However, I firmly believe that no sensible person can deny the necessity of animal testing in certain contexts. The development of new medicines and foods, for instance, requires rigorous testing to ensure their safety and efficacy for human consumption. If these products were to be released into the market without thorough testing, including on animal subjects, the consequences would be dramatically cruel to humanity. The potential harm, from adverse reactions to lethal outcomes, would be immeasurable and unacceptable.It is crucial to weigh the moral implications of animal testing against the potential risks to human health and well-being. While it is true that animal testing involves cruelty to animals, the alternative - releasing untested medicines and foods into the human population - poses a significantly greater risk of harm and suffering. By conducting animal experiments, scientists can identify potential dangers and make necessary adjustments before human trials, thereby safeguarding human health.In conclusion, while the ethical concerns surrounding animal experiments are valid, the benefits of such testing, especially in the development of new medicines and foods, cannot be overlooked. It is a necessary evil that ultimately protects humanity from the potential harms of untested products. Therefore, I believe that animal experiments, when conducted under strict ethical guidelines, are a crucial step in the development of safe and effective medicines and foods for human use.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;The Habit of Excessive Television Watching: A Threat to Productivity and MoralityIn today's world, many people have fallen into the habit of watching television without any sense of limitation or schedule. While watching television shows can be an enjoyable pastime, it is a highly time-consuming activity that can have negative consequences on our daily lives. Excessive television watching can lead to a significant waste of time, which could be better spent on more productive and fulfilling activities.Moreover, watching television programs can make us lazy and lethargic. The more time we spend watching TV, the less time we have for physical activity, socializing, and engaging in mentally stimulating pursuits. This can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is linked to various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle can also affect our mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and decreased cognitive function.Another disturbing aspect of television watching is the promotion of negative activities and behaviors. Some television programs advertise and glorify criminal activities, violence, and other anti-social behaviors. This can have a corrosive influence on our values and morals, especially on young and impressionable minds. By watching such programs, we may unintentionally internalize and normalize these negative behaviors, leading to a decline in our moral character.In conclusion, while watching television can be a harmless and enjoyable activity, excessive and unregulated viewing can have serious consequences on our productivity, health, and morality. It is essential to establish a plan and schedule for watching television, ensuring that it does not interfere with our daily responsibilities and goals. By being mindful of our television viewing habits, we can maintain a healthy balance between entertainment and productivity, and promote a more positive and uplifting lifestyle.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The debate about gender equality in university admissions has sparked a significant discussion in recent years. It is imperative that universities accept equal numbers of students of both genders to foster a balanced and inclusive learning environment. Women, in particular, have made tremendous strides in proving themselves in every field, whether it is indoors, such as in laboratories, hospitals, and offices, or outdoors, as in sports, construction, and other male-dominated industries.The notion that women are limited to certain roles or professions has been debunked, and they have consistently demonstrated their capabilities and talents across various sectors. Therefore, it is essential that universities reflect this progress by admitting equal numbers of male and female students. This approach not only promotes equality but also enriches the academic experience by bringing diverse perspectives and ideas to the table.The current job market plays a significant role in shaping the decision of universities regarding admissions and course design. Employers' needs and requirements influence the curriculum, as universities aim to equip students with the skills and knowledge that are in demand. Every university designs its courses according to the needs of employers, ensuring that graduates are job-ready and can contribute to the workforce effectively. By accepting equal numbers of students from both genders, universities can better respond to the job market's requirements for a diverse and skilled workforce.In conclusion, achieving gender parity in university admissions is not only a matter of equality but also a strategic move to align with the demands of the current job market. Women have proven their capabilities across all fields, and it is time for universities to recognize and reflect this in their admission policies. By doing so, universities can contribute to a more balanced, diverse, and skilled workforce, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The Desire for Independence: A Double-Edged SwordMany young adults yearn to leave their parents' houses as soon as possible, seeking the freedom and independence that comes with living on their own. They envision a life with no limits, where they can make their own decisions and live life on their own terms. However, in their haste to break free from their family's nest, they often overlook the harsh realities of independent living. The truth is, living away from home can be a daunting and challenging experience, especially when it comes to financial stability.One of the primary advantages of living with parents is the significant cost savings. Without the burden of rent, utilities, and other expenses, young adults can allocate their resources towards education, personal development, and savings. In contrast, living in their own houses or apartments means shouldering these costs, which can be overwhelming, especially for those on a limited budget. Furthermore, they will also have to contend with the stresses of finding a compatible roommate, which can be a gamble, and may lead to friction and conflict.In conclusion, while the desire for independence is understandable, young adults should carefully consider the potential consequences of leaving their parents' homes too soon. By staying at home, they can conserve their financial resources, avoid the headaches of roommate hunting, and focus on building a strong foundation for their future. Ultimately, independence is not just about physical separation from one's family, but also about being financially and emotionally prepared to take on the challenges of adulthood.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;Air pollution is a pressing issue that poses a significant threat to the environment, affecting it in multiple ways. One of the most alarming consequences of air pollution is the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, air pollution exacerbates global heating, a phenomenon that has devastating effects on ecosystems and biodiversity. The situation is dire, and it is imperative that immediate action is taken to mitigate the problem.In my opinion, private individuals and companies should bear more responsibility for their role in air pollution. One possible solution is to impose a fee on those who contribute to air pollution, which would be used to clean up the pollution they generate. This approach would not only help to reduce pollution but also encourage individuals and businesses to adopt cleaner practices, as they would have a financial incentive to do so. For instance, companies could invest in cleaner energy sources and more efficient technologies to minimize their pollution footprint, thereby reducing their financial liability.On the other hand, governments also have a crucial role to play in combating air pollution. They should implement and enforce stricter regulations on the use of products that cause air pollution, targeting both individual and business use. This could include restrictions on the use of fossil fuels, as well as incentives for the adoption of electric or hybrid vehicles. Additionally, governments could promote sustainable practices by offering subsidies for renewable energy installations and imposing taxes on polluting industries. By combining these measures, it is possible to significantly reduce air pollution and protect the environment for future generations. Ultimately, a collaborative effort between private entities and governments is essential to effectively address the issue of air pollution.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;The Role of Advertising in Consumer Purchasing DecisionsAdvertising is widely regarded as the most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product. Through various mediums such as television, radio, and social media, advertising has the ability to reach a vast audience and persuade them to buy a particular product. However, it is not sufficient in itself to guarantee the success of a product. The product also needs to satisfy the needs and expectations of the consumers. If a product fails to deliver on its promises, no amount of advertising can save it from failure.A good example of this is when a company launches a new product with a flashy advertising campaign, but the product itself is of poor quality or does not meet the needs of the consumers. In such cases, the advertising may initially generate interest and sales, but once the consumers experience the product, they will be disappointed and unlikely to make a repeat purchase. On the other hand, if a product is of high quality and meets the needs of the consumers, but lacks effective advertising, it may struggle to gain traction in the market.In conclusion, advertising is a reflection of the powerful advertisements that can influence consumer behavior. However, it is only one part of the equation. The product itself must also be of high quality, meet the needs of the consumers, and provide value to them. When advertising and product quality come together, the results can be phenomenal, leading to increased sales, customer loyalty, and ultimately, business success. Therefore, companies must strike a balance between creating effective advertisements and developing products that satisfy the needs and expectations of their target audience. By doing so, they can create a winning combination that drives business growth and profitability.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The debate about the usefulness of universities has been ongoing, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. In this essay, I will analyze both views in order to come up with a fool-proof decision. Those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. They argue that the rising costs of tuition fees, coupled with the increasing burden of student loans, make it an unaffordable option for many. Furthermore, they claim that the skills and knowledge acquired through university education can also be obtained through vocational training, apprenticeships, and online courses. This perspective suggests that university education is not the only pathway to success and that alternative routes can be just as effective.On the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge that broadens one's understanding of the world. They argue that university education fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential in today's fast-paced and ever-changing job market. Moreover, universities offer a platform for networking, personal growth, and development, allowing individuals to explore their passions and interests. Proponents of university education also point out that many professions, such as law, medicine, and engineering, require a university degree, making it a necessary step for those pursuing these careers.After analyzing both perspectives, it becomes clear that university education offers a unique set of benefits that cannot be replicated through alternative means. While it is true that the costs and accessibility of university education can be prohibitive, the advantages it provides in terms of academic knowledge, career skills, and personal growth make it an invaluable investment for those who can afford it. Ultimately, the decision to attend university should be based on individual circumstances and goals, but for many, the benefits of university education far outweigh the costs.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way we live, communicate, and access information. On one hand, mobile phones have brought about unprecedented convenience, allowing us to stay connected with others, interact with a vast array of services, and navigate through unfamiliar territories with ease. However, on the other hand, the proliferation of mobile phones has also given rise to a multitude of problems that warrant attention and analysis.In this essay, I aim to examine three critical issues associated with the widespread use of mobile phones. Firstly, the habit of speaking loudly on the phone in public areas such as schools, libraries, and hospitals is not only inconsiderate but also offensive. Such behavior disrupts the peace and quiet that these spaces are meant to provide, causing disturbance to others who are studying, working, or seeking solace. This lack of etiquette not only reflects poorly on the individual but also contributes to a decline in civic manners and respect for communal spaces.Another significant issue is the misuse of cell phones by students as cheating tools during examinations. This unethical practice undermines the integrity of the educational system, creating an unfair advantage for those who cheat and potentially skewing the assessment of knowledge and capabilities. It also diminishes the value of hard work and honest achievement, fostering a culture of dishonesty and shortcuts.By analyzing these issues, it becomes clear that while mobile phones offer numerous benefits, their improper use can lead to significant social, ethical, and educational problems. It is essential for users to be mindful of their mobile phone etiquette and for institutions to establish and enforce strict policies against the misuse of these devices, especially in sensitive contexts such as examinations. Only through such measures can we mitigate the negative impacts of mobile phone usage and ensure that these powerful tools serve to enhance, rather than detract from, our personal and communal well-being.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The use of computers by children has become a topic of debate in recent years. While some people believe that computers are beneficial for children and should be used daily, others hold a different opinion. In my opinion, excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on children's physical and social development.One of the primary concerns is the impact of computer use on children's eyesight. Prolonged screen time can cause eye strain, headaches, and even lead to myopia or nearsightedness. Children who spend hours staring at screens may experience blurred vision, dry eyes, and increased sensitivity to light. This can have long-term consequences for their eye health and overall well-being.Moreover, excessive computer use, particularly for gaming, can also hinder children's communication skills. Spending too much time playing games on computers can lead to social isolation, reducing opportunities for face-to-face interaction and deep, meaningful conversations. As a result, children may struggle to develop essential social skills, such as empathy, active listening, and conflict resolution. This can affect their ability to form and maintain healthy relationships with peers, family, and community members.In conclusion, while computers can be valuable tools for learning and education, excessive use can have negative consequences for children's physical and social development. It is essential for parents, educators, and caregivers to establish limits and ensure a balance between computer use and other activities that promote physical activity, socialization, and eye health. By doing so, we can help children harness the benefits of computers while minimizing the risks associated with excessive use.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The construction of factories has long been a topic of debate, with proponents arguing that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and opponents citing the negative environmental impacts. However, it is undeniable that the advantages of building a factory will surpass its disadvantages if we effectively address the environmental problems associated with them. On the one hand, a large factory can significantly stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. By providing a substantial number of job opportunities, factories can inject vitality into the local economy, increasing the overall standard of living for residents. Moreover, the establishment of factories can also attract other businesses and investments, fostering a thriving industrial ecosystem.On the other hand, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. As the global population grows and consumer demand increases, the need for mass production and industrialization will only escalate. Rather than resisting this trend, it is crucial that we focus on mitigating the environmental consequences of factory construction, such as pollution and waste management. By implementing sustainable practices, using renewable energy sources, and enforcing stringent environmental regulations, we can minimize the harmful effects of factories on our ecosystem.In conclusion, while the environmental concerns associated with factories are legitimate, they should not overshadow the potential benefits that these establishments can bring to local communities. By prioritizing environmental sustainability and responsible factory management, we can ensure that the advantages of building a factory outweigh its disadvantages, ultimately contributing to the prosperity and development of our society. As we move forward, it is essential that we adopt a balanced approach, harnessing the economic benefits of factories while protecting our planet for future generations.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The Rise of Prepared Food: A Threat to Healthy Eating HabitsThe increasing popularity of prepared food has led to a significant shift in the way people consume meals. While convenient and time-saving, prepared food can bring about some negative influences on our health and lifestyle. One of the primary concerns is the utilization of artificial ingredients in these foods, which can have detrimental effects on our bodies. The excessive use of preservatives, flavor enhancers, and coloring agents can lead to various health problems, including digestive issues, allergies, and even cancer.Furthermore, prepared food often ignores the nutritional value of the ingredients used, prioritizing taste and shelf-life over health benefits. This can result in an imbalanced diet, leading to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals. Moreover, prepared food can modify people's eating habits, encouraging a culture of instant gratification and laziness in the kitchen. The more prepared food we eat, the more cooking skills we lose, making us reliant on processed meals and undermining our ability to prepare healthy, homemade dishes.As a consequence, the decline of cooking skills can have long-term effects on our health and wellbeing. Cooking from scratch allows us to control the ingredients, portion sizes, and nutritional content of our meals, ensuring that we consume a balanced diet. In contrast, prepared food often comes with a side of guilt, as we are unsure of what goes into its production. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between convenience and nutrition, making a conscious effort to cook from scratch and prepare healthy meals. By doing so, we can preserve our cooking skills, ensure a balanced diet, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, while prepared food may be convenient, its negative influences on our health and eating habits cannot be ignored, and it is crucial that we prioritize healthy eating habits and cooking skills to maintain a wholesome lifestyle.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;"The disparity in economic development between nations has led to a significant gap in the standard of living among countries. In an effort to bridge this gap, some developed countries and organizations have been providing financial assistance to impoverished nations. This aid is often justified by the necessity of developing education in these countries, as a educated population is essential for economic growth and development.The primary objective of these supporters is to empower the impoverished countries to become self-sufficient and break the cycle of poverty. By investing in education, they aim to create a skilled and knowledgeable workforce that can drive economic growth and development. For instance, organizations like the World Bank and the United Nations provide financial assistance to develop educational infrastructure, improve teacher training, and increase access to education in disadvantaged communities.However, it is well acknowledged that ""there is no free lunch in the world."" This proverbial expression suggests that every action has a consequence, and in the context of financial assistance, it implies that the aid provided by developed countries and organizations often comes with strings attached. The supporters may have ulterior motives, such as promoting their own economic interests, expanding their political influence, or gaining access to natural resources. Moreover, the recipient countries may be required to adopt certain economic policies or reforms that benefit the donor countries, rather than their own development.In conclusion, while the provision of financial assistance to impoverished countries is a noble endeavor, it is essential to recognize the underlying motivations and potential consequences. The development of education is crucial for economic growth, but it is equally important to ensure that the aid is provided with the genuine objective of promoting self-sufficiency and sustainable development, rather than serving the interests of the donor countries. Ultimately, the recipients of financial assistance must be aware of the potential strings attached and strive to maintain their independence and autonomy in the face of foreign aid."
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The issue of advertising has been a topic of debate for many years. On one hand, advertising is a crucial means for companies, firms, and individuals to promote their goods and services, thereby boosting their sales and revenue. Many businesses, as well as governments, rely heavily on advertising to reach their target audience and achieve their goals. However, on the other hand, there is a growing concern that certain types of advertisements can have a detrimental impact on children.Advertisements for alcohol, cigarettes, and goods and services with adult content are particularly problematic. Exposure to these types of ads can lead to a range of negative effects on children, including the promotion of unhealthy habits, the glorification of substance abuse, and the exposure to explicit content. Children are highly impressionable and may be influenced by these ads, leading to a range of negative consequences, including health problems, addiction, and distorted values.Therefore, it is imperative that advertisements for alcohol, cigarettes, and goods and services with adult content be prohibited. This is not only a moral obligation, but also a social responsibility. By prohibiting these types of ads, we can protect our children from the potential harm they may cause and promote a healthier and more positive environment for them to grow and develop. While advertising is an essential tool for businesses and governments, the well-being and protection of children must take precedence. By finding alternative and more responsible ways to advertise, we can promote a more sustainable and ethical approach to marketing, one that prioritizes the well-being of our children and the values of our society. Ultimately, the prohibition of harmful advertisements is a necessary step towards creating a safer and more responsible advertising environment.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The modern era has witnessed a significant shift in the societal norms, with married women now having the equal right to pursue careers like their male counterparts. The eradication of employment discrimination based on gender has paved the way for married women to join the workforce, thereby empowering them to contribute to their family's financial well-being. By taking up a job, a wife can earn a substantial income, which can be instrumental in supporting her family life, providing for their needs, and enhancing their overall quality of life.Working outside the house not only brings financial benefits but also creates opportunities for married women to interact with the outer world. This exposure helps to strengthen their character, build confidence, and demonstrate their capabilities. As they navigate through the challenges of their profession, they develop resilience, independence, and a sense of self-worth. Moreover, their involvement in the workforce allows them to broaden their social circle, make new connections, and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.The impact of working married women extends beyond their personal and professional growth, as they also set a positive example for their children. By observing their mother's dedication, hard work, and commitment to her career, children learn valuable lessons about the importance of perseverance, responsibility, and balance between work and family life. This, in turn, can inspire them to pursue their own passions and ambitions, fostering a sense of ambition and motivation. In conclusion, the empowerment of married women to take up jobs has been a significant step forward, not only for their personal and financial growth but also for the values and examples they set for their families, contributing to a more equitable and progressive society.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The provision of education is a fundamental responsibility of governments worldwide. It is essential that governments provide primary and secondary education to their citizens, as this lays the foundation for a knowledgeable and skilled population. However, this responsibility should be limited to the foundational levels of education. When it comes to higher education, such as university, the burden of cost should shift to the students or their parents.While it is true that some parents may not have the financial means to pay for their children's university fees, it is also important to consider the economic realities faced by governments. The government has already borne the significant costs of providing primary and secondary education, and it is not feasible for them to bear the entire cost of higher education as well. Governments have numerous other responsibilities and priorities, and the financial burden of funding university education for all would be overwhelming.Moreover, the principle of personal responsibility suggests that individuals or their families should contribute to the costs of their higher education, as they are the direct beneficiaries of the advanced knowledge and skills acquired. This approach also encourages a sense of investment and commitment to one's own educational pursuits. However, to mitigate the issue of affordability, governments and educational institutions could explore alternatives such as scholarships, grants, and income-based repayment plans to support those who cannot afford the fees.In conclusion, while it is crucial for governments to provide foundational education, the cost of higher education should be shared with the students or their parents. This balance ensures that education remains accessible while also acknowledging the economic limitations of governments and promoting personal responsibility among individuals pursuing advanced degrees.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The advent of modern technology has led to a great deal of attention being paid to means of transportation. In recent years, the debate over the most convenient and environmentally friendly mode of transportation has gained significant momentum. On one hand, some people state that the automobile is the most convenient form of transportation, offering individuals the freedom to travel wherever and whenever they please. The automobile provides a sense of autonomy and flexibility that is unparalleled by other modes of transportation.On the other hand, others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. The proliferation of automobiles has led to a significant increase in air pollution, noise pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, all of which have severe consequences for the environment and human health. In light of these concerns, it is imperative that alternative modes of transportation, as cycling, walking, or public transport be explored and promoted. These alternatives not only reduce our reliance on fossil fuels but also provide numerous health benefits, such as reduced stress and increased physical activity.In the following passages, several reasons will be described carefully to support the notion that alternative forms of transportation should be prioritized. These reasons will encompass not only the environmental benefits but also the economic and social advantages of adopting greener modes of transportation. By examining the consequences of our transportation choices, it is hoped that individuals will be encouraged to rethink their daily commutes and consider the long-term implications of their actions on the environment and society as a whole. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account both convenience and sustainability is necessary to create a transportation system that meets the needs of the present without compromising the future.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The act of aiding poor countries has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that it is a futile effort with negligible benefits. However, I firmly believe that the positive effects of aiding poor countries far outweigh the potential side-effects, and for several compelling reasons. Firstly, poor countries are often plagued by a severe shortage of basic materials and facilities, which hinders their ability to start businesses and stimulate economic growth. By providing aid, these countries can access essential resources, such as technology, infrastructure, and expertise, that can help them establish a strong foundation for development. This, in turn, can create jobs, increase income, and improve the overall standard of living for their citizens.Secondly, aiding campaigns raises awareness and encourages consideration about the plight of poor people. It brings attention to the struggles faced by these communities and prompts individuals, organizations, and governments to take action. This increased awareness can lead to a greater sense of empathy and social responsibility, inspiring more people to get involved in poverty reduction efforts.Thirdly, the campaigns often include practical benefits, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, which are essential for human survival. These tangible benefits can have a direct and immediate impact on the lives of people living in poverty, improving their health, well-being, and overall quality of life. Furthermore, aid campaigns can also provide opportunities for education and skills training, empowering individuals to break the cycle of poverty and build a brighter future for themselves and their families.In conclusion, aiding poor countries is a worthwhile endeavor that yields numerous benefits, from providing essential resources and raising awareness, to offering practical assistance and empowering individuals. While there may be some side-effects, the positive outcomes of aid campaigns undoubtedly outweigh the drawbacks, making it a crucial investment in the fight against poverty and towards a more equitable world.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world.

I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";The advent of globalization has sparked intense debates among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. On one hand, some people perceive globalization as a threat to the ethnic and religious values of their country. They argue that the influx of foreign cultures, ideas, and practices can lead to the erosion of traditional values and cultural identities. This fear is rooted in the belief that globalization promotes a homogenization of cultures, where local customs and beliefs are replaced by dominant Western values. As a result, many individuals feel that their unique cultural heritage is being undermined, and their sense of belonging and identity is being threatened.On the other hand, others believe that globalization contributes effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. They argue that globalization has facilitated the exchange of ideas, technologies, and innovations, leading to unprecedented economic growth, improved living standards, and increased access to education and healthcare. Globalization has also enabled the formation of international partnerships, cooperation, and diplomacy, which have helped to promote peace, stability, and human rights. Moreover, globalization has created new opportunities for cultural exchange, allowing people to learn about and appreciate diverse cultures, fostering greater understanding, tolerance, and empathy.In conclusion, the impact of globalization on ethnic and religious values is a complex and multifaceted issue.

Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that globalization is a dynamic and evolving process that can be shaped and managed to promote cultural diversity, understanding, and cooperation. By embracing the benefits of globalization while preserving and respecting local cultures and traditions, we can work towards creating a more harmonious and prosperous world for all.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate on whether children should be required to attend school or be allowed to leave early to pursue a job has been a longstanding one. Many people believe that attending school is essential for gaining knowledge and preparing for a successful future. On the other hand, some argue that allowing children to leave school early can enable them to enter the workforce and start earning a living. Personally, I agree with the viewpoint that students should be required to attend school. Attending school provides children with a solid foundation of knowledge, skills, and socialization that are crucial for their future success. Schools offer a structured and supportive environment where students can learn and develop at their own pace. Moreover, school education helps children to develop important life skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication, which are essential for achieving their goals and pursuing their passions.Forcing students to attend school also ensures that they are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to make informed decisions about their future careers and lives. Without a proper education, children may be limited in their career choices and may struggle to compete in the job market. Furthermore, education has a positive impact on society as a whole, as it helps to create informed, responsible, and engaged citizens who can contribute to the betterment of their communities.In conclusion, while some may argue that allowing children to leave school early can provide them with an opportunity to enter the workforce, I firmly believe that attending school is essential for preparing children for a successful and fulfilling future. By attending school, children can gain the knowledge, skills, and socialization necessary to achieve their goals and make a positive impact on society.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The impact of advertisements on consumer behavior has been a topic of debate among many. Some people argue that advertisements have a manipulative effect, convincing individuals to purchase products that are unnecessary and only appear appealing on television. It is true that some advertisements can be misleading, exaggerating the benefits of a product or making false claims. However, it is also important to acknowledge the significant role that advertisements play in the economy.Advertisements serve as a vital means of introducing new products to the market, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. By showcasing various options, advertisements enable individuals to make informed decisions about their purchases. Furthermore, advertisements are often visually enjoyable, with creative and engaging storylines that capture the viewer's attention. This not only makes the viewing experience more pleasant but also helps to create a lasting impression of the product in the consumer's mind.The economic importance of advertisements cannot be overstated. They contribute significantly to the revenue of media outlets, such as television stations and newspapers, and provide employment opportunities for people working in the advertising industry. Additionally, advertisements help businesses to reach their target audience, promoting their products and services to potential customers. In conclusion, while it is true that some advertisements can be misleading, their overall impact on the economy and consumer choice is undeniable. By providing a platform for businesses to showcase their products and offering consumers a range of options, advertisements play a vital role in driving economic activity and promoting consumer choice. Ultimately, advertisements are a necessary part of a functioning market economy, and their benefits outweigh their drawbacks.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The possession and use of guns is a highly debated topic in today's society. Unlike other commodities, a gun is definitely not a kind of normal good, which is strictly controlled in most countries. The reasoning behind this stringent control is multifaceted, and from my point of view, it is sensible to enforce gun control. The primary motivation for advocating strict gun control stems from the alarming rise in accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates that are directly or indirectly associated with the availability of firearms.The argument for gun control is reinforced by the stark reality of gun-related accidents. Many incidents of accidental shootings, often involving children or unauthorized users, have highlighted the dangers of having guns in uncontrolled environments. Furthermore, the ease of access to guns has been correlated with an increase in violent crime rates. Criminals armed with guns pose a significant threat to public safety, leading to higher rates of homicides and armed robberies. Moreover, the availability of guns has also been linked to higher suicide rates. The impulsivity of suicidal acts can be greatly facilitated by the easy access to lethal means such as guns, resulting in irreversible and tragic consequences. Given these compelling reasons, it is logical to support the strict limitation of guns. By enforcing stricter gun control laws, societies can potentially reduce the number of accidents, violent crimes, and suicides. This proactive approach not only contributes to a safer community but also upholds the moral obligation to protect human life. In conclusion, considering the multifaceted risks associated with the unregulated availability of guns, enforcing strict gun control is not only sensible but necessary for the well-being and safety of society.

37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The advent of technology has been a highly debated topic, with some individuals arguing that it exacerbates the gap between the rich and the poor. However, I strongly disagree with this notion, and my dissent is rooted in two primary reasons.Firstly, the progression of material technology has led to a significant reduction in the prices of numerous products. As technology advances, the production costs of goods decrease, making them more affordable and accessible to a wider audience, including low-income households. This phenomenon has been observed in the electronics industry, where the prices of smartphones, laptops, and televisions have plummeted over the years, allowing people from all walks of life to own these devices. Consequently, the divide between the rich and the poor is bridged, as everyone can now access these essential tools, which were previously reserved for the affluent.Secondly, technical developments have substantially improved productivity, liberating people from mundane chores and enabling them to devote more time and energy to pursuing a more meaningful life. Automation, artificial intelligence, and the internet have collectively reduced the time spent on tedious tasks, permitting individuals to focus on creative pursuits, personal growth, and self-improvement. This, in turn, has empowered people to break free from the shackles of poverty, as they can now allocate their time and resources to activities that generate greater value and prosperity. By doing so, technology has created a more level playing field, where anyone can succeed, regardless of their socioeconomic background.In conclusion, the notion that technology widens the gap between the rich and the poor is a misconception. On the contrary, technological advancements have made products more affordable and improved productivity, ultimately providing people with the tools and opportunities to enhance their lives and socioeconomic status.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;The idea of space exploration has been a topic of debate for many years. While a significant number of people still consider it an act of wasting money, there are compelling reasons why human beings should travel to outer space. One of the most notable benefits of space exploration is the wealth of knowledge it has provided about our planet. A prime example of this is the picture of Planet Earth taken from outer space, which conclusively proved that the Earth is indeed round, not flat. This image not only settled a long-standing debate but also marked a significant milestone in our understanding of the planet.Moreover, observing Planet Earth from outer space has enabled us to gain invaluable insights into the atmosphere of our planet. By studying the Earth from this unique perspective, we have been able to gather crucial data about the composition and behavior of the atmosphere, including the effects of climate change and pollution. This information has been instrumental in shaping our environmental policies and conservation efforts. The ability to monitor the Earth's atmosphere from space has also allowed us to better understand and predict weather patterns, including hurricanes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters, ultimately saving countless lives and reducing the risk of devastation.In conclusion, while some people may view space exploration as a frivolous expense, the benefits it has provided, and continues to provide, are undeniable. The knowledge gained from observing Planet Earth from outer space has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the planet and its atmosphere. As we continue to explore and discover more about the vastness of space, we may uncover even more reasons why space travel is not only justified but essential for the progress and preservation of human life on Earth.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. Although, to some extents, this phenomenon is proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. The benefits of students engaging in extra jobs while pursuing their higher education are multifaceted and significant.One of the most notable advantages is the opportunity for students to gain practical experience. By getting involved in extra jobs, students can apply theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom to real-world situations, thereby enhancing their understanding and retention of the subject matter. This hands-on experience not only enriches their academic journey but also equips them with skills that are highly valued by employers, such as problem-solving, teamwork, and time management.Moreover, engaging in extra jobs allows students to develop a sense of financial independence and responsibility. Earning their own money, students are more likely to budget wisely, prioritize needs over wants, and appreciate the value of money. This independence also fosters a sense of self-reliance and confidence, which are essential for personal and professional growth.Additionally, extra jobs provide students with a platform to network and build relationships outside the academic sphere. These connections can be invaluable for future career opportunities, as they offer a chance to learn about different industries, gain mentors, and potentially secure job offers upon graduation.While there are concerns about the potential negative impacts of extra jobs on academic performance, I firmly believe that with proper time management and prioritization, students can balance work and study effectively. The benefits of gaining practical experience, financial independence, and networking opportunities make engaging in extra jobs a highly rewarding experience for students. Ultimately, it prepares them for the workforce, enhances their personal development, and sets them up for success in their future careers.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to work for companies without salaries has become a common phenomenon in recent years. This activity, often referred to as an internship, is mutually beneficial for both the students and the organizations involved. For students, internships provide invaluable hands-on experience and exposure to the real work environment, which is often lacking in traditional classroom settings. By working in a professional setting, students can apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, develop their skills, and gain a competitive edge in the job market.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save them some money. Without having to pay salaries, companies can allocate their resources more efficiently, while still benefiting from the fresh perspectives and ideas that interns bring. Moreover, the internship program allows companies to identify and recruit talented individuals, reducing the costs and time associated with the recruitment process. Additionally, hosting interns can also enhance a company's reputation and social responsibility, as it demonstrates their commitment to supporting education and developing the next generation of professionals.Furthermore, the internship experience can also foster a sense of innovation and creativity within the company. Students, unencumbered by conventional thinking, can bring new ideas and approaches to problem-solving, which can lead to novel solutions and products. In return, companies can provide students with mentorship, guidance, and networking opportunities, which are essential for their future careers. Overall, the activity of sending students to work for companies without salaries is a win-win situation, where both parties can benefit from the exchange of skills, knowledge, and resources. By embracing this practice, schools, students, and companies can work together to create a more dynamic, innovative, and productive workforce.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The age-old question of what motivates employees to be more hard-working and productive has been a topic of debate among managers and researchers alike. While it is often assumed that raising salaries is the only way to boost employee motivation, this essay argues that this is not necessarily the case. A raise or a promotion can, doubt increase morale in the workplace, as it provides a tangible reward for an employee's hard work and dedication. However, it is not the only factor that drives employee motivation.Research has shown that non-monetary incentives, such as recognition, autonomy, and opportunities for growth and development, can be just as effective in motivating employees. For instance, a study found that employees who were given more autonomy and flexibility in their work reported higher levels of job satisfaction and engagement. Similarly, employees who received regular feedback and recognition for their achievements reported higher levels of motivation and productivity.Moreover, a work environment that fosters a sense of community, teamwork, and purpose can also play a significant role in motivating employees. When employees feel connected to their colleagues and are working towards a common goal, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their work. Additionally, opportunities for professional development, such as training and mentorship programs, can also motivate employees to work harder and be more productive.In conclusion, while a raise or a promotion can certainly motivate employees, it is not the only way to increase morale and productivity in the workplace. By providing non-monetary incentives, fostering a positive work environment, and offering opportunities for growth and development, employers can motivate their employees to be more hard-working and productive, without solely relying on salary increases. By taking a more holistic approach to employee motivation, employers can create a more engaged, motivated, and productive workforce.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;The world of large scale sports games has a profound impact on society, often overshadowing international disputes and fostering national pride. These events have the unique ability to unite people, distracting them from global conflicts and instead, focusing their attention on attractive contests. This shift in attention not only promotes a sense of community and shared identity among citizens but also plays a significant role in promoting peace and harmony.Sports events serve as an important link to peace, providing a platform where nations can engage in friendly competition, setting aside their differences. The Olympic Games, for instance, bring together athletes from around the world, embodying the spirit of unity and cooperation. As people from diverse backgrounds come together to compete,Furthermore, large scale sports games encourage people to display their national symbols, such as flags, anthems, and jerseys, which instills a sense of national pride. This expression of patriotism is not only a source of personal pride but also a demonstration of respect and admiration for one's country. The display of national symbols during sports events transcends mere symbolism, as it represents a collective identity and a shared sense of belonging among citizens.In conclusion, large scale sports games have the power to redirect people's focus from international disputes to attractive contests, cultivating national pride and a sense of community. By analysing the role of sports events in promoting peace and encouraging the display of national symbols, it becomes evident that these events are more than just entertainment - they are a catalyst for unity, peace, and national pride. As the world continues to grapple with conflicts and divisions, the significance of large scale sports games in bringing people together and fostering a sense of global citizenship cannot be overstated.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The world's energy landscape is dominated by a single major source: water. Despite the prevalence of water shortages, which can hinder electricity generation, many countries still heavily rely on this source to power their homes, industries, and economies. Hydroelectric power plants, which harness the energy of moving water to generate electricity, are a significant contributor to the global energy mix.However, the sources most widely used currently to generate power, such as fossil fuels, release an extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere. The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity and heat releases massive amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. This has severe consequences, including rising temperatures, melting of polar ice caps, and altered weather patterns.It is ironic that water, a source of energy, is also affected by the changing climate. Changes in precipitation patterns and increased evaporation due to warmer temperatures can exacerbate water shortages, making it even more challenging to generate electricity from hydroelectric power plants. Moreover, the reliance on water as a major source of energy can have significant implications for food production, industrial processes, and human consumption, as the demand for this limited resource continues to grow.In conclusion, while water remains a major source of energy today, the environmental consequences of our current energy mix cannot be ignored. It is essential to diversify our energy sources, invest in renewable energy technologies, and implement sustainable practices to mitigate the effects of global warming. By doing so, we can ensure a more resilient and environmentally conscious energy future, where water and other vital resources are valued and protected for generations to come.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;Unemployment is a pervasive issue that affects both developed and developing countries, leaving a significant portion of the population without a steady income. The impact of unemployment is multifaceted, influencing not only the individual but also the broader economy and societal stability. While it is tempting to place the responsibility of addressing unemployment squarely on the shoulders of governments,, I argue that it is equally, if not more, the responsibility of disadvantaged citizens themselves to take proactive steps towards improving their employment prospects.Governments can certainly play a crucial role in creating an environment conducive to job creation and economic growth through policies, investments in education, and infrastructure development. However, relying solely on governmental intervention can lead to dependency and a lack of personal initiative. Disadvantaged citizens, who are often the most affected by unemployment, have the capacity to empower themselves through self-education, skill development, and entrepreneurship. In many cases, individuals have successfully transitioned into employment or created their own opportunities by recognizing gaps in the market and leveraging their skills and passions to fill them.Moreover, the notion that individuals should wait for governmental assistance overlooks the potential for personal and community-led initiatives. Community programs, volunteer work, and cooperative businesses can flourish when individuals take the lead, not only providing employment but also fostering a sense of community and purpose. Furthermore, the acquisition of new skills, especially those in demand in the modern job market such as digital literacy and soft skills, can significantly enhance an individual's employability without necessitating governmental subsidies.In conclusion, while governments have a role to play in mitigating the effects of unemployment, it is misguided to place the onus entirely on them. Disadvantaged citizens, through their own efforts and initiatives, can and should take an active role in enhancing their employability and creating opportunities for themselves and their communities. This approach not only leads to personal empowerment but also contributes to a more resilient and self-sufficient society. By acknowledging and acting upon this responsibility, individuals can transform their circumstances and contribute to a reduction in unemployment rates, fostering a more equitable and thriving economic environment.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The concept of a university has undergone significant evolution over the years. At its core, a university is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. This fundamental principle suggests that the primary role of a university is to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge, rather than to dictate the specific courses or training that students must undergo.In common sense, it is not necessary for a university to offer a certain course or type of training to students. Instead, these resources should be made available when needed, as dictated by the demands of the students and the ever-changing landscape of the job market. By adopting this approach, universities can ensure that they remain relevant and responsive to the needs of their students, providing them with the knowledge and skills required to succeed in their chosen fields.This flexible approach also acknowledges that students have different learning needs and interests. By making courses and training available on an as-needed basis, universities can cater to the diverse requirements of their student body, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all approach. Furthermore, this approach encourages universities to be more adaptive and innovative, continuously updating their offerings to reflect the latest developments and advancements in various fields.Ultimately, the role of a university is to empower students with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities necessary to navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world. By providing access to knowledge and resources on an as-needed basis, universities can fulfill this role more effectively, fostering a culture of lifelong learning and intellectual curiosity among their students. By embracing this vision, universities can truly fulfill their purpose as dynamic and responsive institutions of higher learning.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The notion that zoos are sanctuaries for wildlife has been a topic of debate among conservationists and animal welfare advocates. However, a closer examination of the role of zoos in protecting wild lives reveals a more sinister reality. In fact, zoos are more likely to be a killer than a protector, ultimately causing more harm than good to the very animals they claim to safeguard.The argument that zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species is fundamentally flawed. Instead of housing animals in captivity, strict laws prohibiting poaching and habitat destruction would provide a more effective shelter for various kinds of animals in their natural habitat. By preserving and protecting natural habitats, animals can thrive in their own environments, free from the stresses and dangers of captivity.Moreover, zoos often prioritize entertainment and profit over animal welfare, subjecting animals to cramped and unsanitary conditions, inadequate food and care, and the psychological trauma of being confined to small enclosures. This can lead to a range of behavioral and physical problems, ultimately shortening the lifespan of the animals. Furthermore, zoos often fail to provide adequate conservation efforts, with many species being removed from their natural habitats and placed in zoos, only to be bred in captivity and never released back into the wild.In conclusion, the idea that zoos are a necessary evil in the protection of wild lives is a myth. Strict laws and conservation efforts that prioritize the preservation of natural habitats and the protection of animals in their natural environments are far more effective in safeguarding the well-being of wildlife. By acknowledging the harm caused by zoos and working towards more effective conservation strategies, we can truly make a positive impact on the protection of wild lives.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way education is delivered, making online-teaching an indispensable tool for colleges and universities. Distance-learning, which was once considered a niche, has now become a mainstream phenomenon, bringing significant convenience for students worldwide. With the click of a button, students can access high-quality educational content from anywhere, at any time,,ing to a more flexible and accessible learning experience.One of the most significant advantages of online-teaching is the presence of video conferencing, which enables a teacher to teach a greater number of students simultaneously. This technology allows for real-time interaction between teachers and students, fostering a sense of community and facilitating discussions, debates, and feedback. Moreover, video conferencing eliminates geographical barriers, enabling students from diverse backgrounds and locations to participate in a single virtual classroom. This not only promotes diversity but also exposes students to different perspectives, broadening their understanding of the subject matter.The convenience offered by online-teaching is unparalleled. Students can balance their academic pursuits with work, family, or other commitments, as they can learn at their own pace. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for working professionals, stay-at-home parents, or those living in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Furthermore, online resources and study materials can be easily updated, ensuring that students have access to the most current and relevant information.In conclusion, online-teaching should be widely adopted by colleges and universities as it offers a convenient, flexible, and accessible learning experience. The integration of video conferencing has enhanced the online learning experience, allowing teachers to reach a broader audience and promoting a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. As technology continues to advance, it is imperative that educational institutions harness its potential to provide high-quality education to students worldwide, thereby bridging the gap between accessibility and affordability. By embracing online-teaching, we can create a more equitable and connected global learning community.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technologies has revolutionized the way we interact and communicate with one another. Mobile phones, emails, and internet chat programs like MSN Messenger have become an integral part of our daily lives, bringing about significant changes in recent years. On one hand, these innovations have made it possible for people to stay connected with friends and family across geographical distances, fostering global communication and networking.However, the impact of modern communication technologies is not universally positive. Some argue that the benefits of these technologies are limited to the more privileged segments of society, who have the means to access and utilize them. This has created a digital divide, where those with limited financial resources or living in areas with poor infrastructure are left behind, unable to reap the benefits of modern communication. Opponents of modern communication technologies claim that this disparity exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, further marginalizing already vulnerable populations.Despite these concerns, it is undeniable that modern communication technologies have transformed the way we live, work, and interact. They have enabled instant access to information, facilitated global connectivity, and opened up new avenues for education, commerce, and entertainment. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge the disparities in access and usage, and work towards bridging the digital divide. By ensuring that modern communication technologies are inclusive and accessible to all, we can harness their full potential to drive positive change and improve the lives of people from all walks of life. Ultimately, the key to maximizing the benefits of modern communication technologies lies in addressing the underlying inequalities and making them a tool for empowerment, rather than a source of division.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate over whether music should be a mandatory subject in high school has sparked intense discussion among educators and students alike. While many argue that music is an essential part of a well-rounded education and should be taught as a main subject, others contend that it is an unnecessary subject that should be optional at best. In my opinion, I firmly believe that students should prioritize learning occupation-related subjects to develop their professional skills.Proponents of music education claim that it enhances cognitive abilities, as well as promotes creativity and cultural appreciation. However, in today's competitive job market, I believe that students should focus on acquiring skills that will increase their employability and prepare them for their chosen careers. With the ever-increasing demand for specialized professionals, it is crucial that students concentrate on learning subjects that are directly relevant to their future occupations.By making music an optional subject, students can still pursue their passion for music without compromising their academic and professional development. This approach will allow students to explore their interests in music outside of the regular curriculum, such as through extracurricular activities or private lessons. Meanwhile, they can devote more time and energy to core subjects like mathematics, science, and language, which are essential for their future careers.In conclusion, while music is undoubtedly a valuable subject, I believe that it should be optional in high school to allow students to prioritize their professional development. By doing so, students can develop the skills and expertise required to succeed in their chosen fields, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful career.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;The success of a university is multifaceted, relying on various aspects to provide students with a well-rounded education and experience. Two key components that contribute to a university's success are its libraries and sports activities. While both are essential, I firmly believe that universities should prioritize investing in libraries over other areas, including sports activities.First and foremost, a library is a vital and strategic part of a university. It serves as the heart of academic learning, providing students with access to a vast array of resources, including books, journals, and digital databases. Libraries offer a quiet and conducive environment for students to study, research, and collaborate on projects. The resources available in libraries are fundamental to the academic success of students, and their importance cannot be overstated. A well-stocked and maintained library is essential for fostering a culture of learning and academic excellence within a university.Second, unlike other university facilities such as sports complexes or cafeteria services, libraries typically do not generate income. They rely heavily on university funding to operate and maintain their collections and services. This financial dependence underscores the need for universities to prioritize investment in libraries. By doing so, universities can ensure that their libraries remain equipped with the latest resources and technologies, supporting the academic pursuits of their students. In contrast, sports activities, while valuable for student well-being and campus life, can sometimes generate revenue through events and sponsorships, making them less dependent on university allocations.In conclusion, while both libraries and sports activities are crucial for the overall success and appeal of a university, the strategic importance and financial dependence of libraries make a strong case for prioritized investment. By investing more in libraries, universities can bolster the academic foundation of their institutions, ultimately enhancing the educational experience and outcomes for their students.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";"The widespread use of English has sparked a heated debate about its impact on culture and language diversity. On one hand, some people claim that the prevalence of English brings a great number of benefits for people, including increased opportunities for communication, education, and economic advancement. English has become the lingua franca of international business, science, and technology, allowing people from different countries to communicate and collaborate effectively.On the other hand, opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed cultural diversity and led to the extinction of many less-used languages. As English becomes the primary language of international communication, many local languages and dialects are being forgotten, especially among younger generations. This loss of linguistic diversity is a significant concern, as language is often closely tied to culture and identity. The erosion of local languages can lead to the loss of cultural heritage and traditional practices, ultimately threatening the unique characteristics of different communities.Moreover, even English, a sophisticated language, does not express every detail of life, particularly in Asian countries, which have totally different linguistic systems. For instance, the concept of ""guanxi"" in Chinese culture, which refers to the complex network of social relationships and obligations, cannot be fully captured by English. Similarly, the Japanese concept of ""wa"" (harmony) and the Indian concept of ""dharma"" (duty) are difficult to translate and convey in English. This limitation of English highlights the importance of preserving and promoting local languages, which are better equipped to express the nuances and complexities of local cultures. In conclusion, while English has its benefits, it is essential to recognize the value of linguistic diversity and take steps to preserve and promote local languages and cultures."
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The use of animals for personal needs has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While many people encourage the utilization of animals for various purposes, such as transportation,,assistant, and companionship, others are concerned that animals are being misused and exploited. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to see farmers and owners pushing animals beyond their limits, often prioritizing productivity and profit over the well-being of the animal.This exploitation is a clear indication that humans have forgotten their responsibility towards animals. Rather than treating animals as commodities or objects for personal gain, humans should behave as guardians to these creatures. As guardians, it is our duty to ensure the welfare and safety of animals, providing them with a safe and nurturing environment. This means treating animals with respect, kindness, and compassion, rather than subjecting them to harsh conditions and mistreatment.By adopting a guardian-like approach, we can work towards creating a more harmonious and sustainable relationship between humans and animals. This not only benefits the animals themselves but also contributes to the overall well-being of our planet. Animals play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems, and their mistreatment can have far-reaching consequences for the environment.In conclusion, it is essential that we reevaluate our relationship with animals and recognize our role as their guardians. By doing so, we can put an end to the exploitation and mistreatment of animals and work towards creating a more compassionate and sustainable world. It is our responsibility to protect and care for animals, rather than using them for our own selfish needs. By making this shift, we can promote a culture of kindness, empathy, and respect towards all living beings.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The advent of modern technology has led some to speculate that museums and art galleries will soon become relics of the past. However, this notion overlooks the profound importance of these institutions in preserving and promoting education and culture. While digital advancements have undoubtedly expanded our access to information and artworks, the role of museums and galleries extends far beyond what can be replicated on screens.One of the primary reasons museums and art galleries will endure is their ability to provide an immersive, experiential learning environment. Authentic exhibits, which include historical artifacts, artworks, and scientific specimens, cannot be fully appreciated or understood through images and videos alone. The tactile experience of viewing these items in person, understanding their scale, texture, and context, offers a depth of learning that digital media cannot match. For instance, standing before a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa or examining the intricate details of an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus provides a tangible connection to history and art that digital reproductions cannot replicate.Furthermore, museums and galleries serve as custodians of cultural heritage, offering insights into the past, present, and future of human creativity and innovation. They host a wide range of activities, from workshops and lectures to interactive exhibits, all of which foster community engagement, education, and cultural enrichment. These institutions also play a critical role in preserving artifacts for future generations, ensuring that our collective cultural and historical legacy is safeguarded.In conclusion, the importance of museums and art galleries in the digital age is undeniable. They provide unique educational and cultural experiences that complement, rather than compete with, modern technology. Instead of disappearing, these institutions are likely to evolve, incorporating digital tools to enhance visitor experiences while maintaining their core mission of preserving, exhibiting, and teaching about the world's cultural and natural treasures. As such, they will continue to thrive, offering irreplaceable experiences that enrich our understanding of ourselves and our place within the broader tapestry of human history and culture.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate on whether students should be taught a wide range of subjects or focus on a single subject has sparked intense discussion among the public. On one hand, some parents are content with the comprehensive curriculum offered in schools, which exposes their children to various subjects such as mathematics, science, languages, and humanities. They believe that this approach provides a well-rounded education, allowing students to develop a broad range of skills and interests. A full class schedule, they argue, prepares students for an ever-changing world, where adaptability and versatility are essential.On the other hand, some parents and educators argue that focusing on a single subject is more effective. They claim that by concentrating on one area of study, students can delve deeper and gain a more profound understanding of the subject matter. This approach, they believe, enables students to develop expertise and mastery, which can lead to greater academic achievement and success. Proponents of this approach point to examples of students who have excelled in a particular field, such as music or mathematics, and argue that early specialization can foster exceptional talent.However, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks of each approach. A narrow focus on a single subject may lead to a lack of exposure to other important areas of study, potentially limiting a student's future opportunities. Conversely, a broad curriculum may lead to a superficial understanding of multiple subjects, without allowing for in-depth exploration. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines elements of both perspectives may be the most effective, allowing students to explore a range of subjects while also pursuing areas of particular interest and aptitude. By acknowledging the validity of both viewpoints, educators and policymakers can work towards creating a more flexible and effective education system.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The widespread use of English has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today's globalized world. While some may argue that it has negative effects, such as the erosion of native languages and cultures, I firmly believe that the prevalence of English brings numerous benefits to individuals and countries alike. In my country, for instance, English is a required course from elementary school, which has far-reaching consequences. One of the most significant advantages is that it has made studying abroad a feasible and attractive option for youngsters.With a solid foundation in English, students can easily navigate academic programs in foreign countries, where English is often the primary language of instruction. This has led to a surge in international student mobility, with many young people opting to pursue higher education abroad. Not only does this broaden their cultural horizons, but it also equips them with a competitive edge in the job market. Moreover, the ability to communicate in English has become a highly valued skill, opening up avenues for career advancement and global networking.Furthermore, researchers, particularly those working in high-tech fields, benefit immensely from proficiency in English. The language has become the lingua franca of scientific and technological research, with most academic papers and journals being published in English. Consequently, researchers who are fluent in English have access to a vast array of references, enabling them to stay abreast of the latest developments and breakthroughs in their fields. This, in turn, facilitates collaboration and innovation, driving progress and advancement in various disciplines. In conclusion, the widespread use of English has undeniable benefits, from facilitating international education and research to fostering global understanding and cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of English as a common language will only continue to grow.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The Origin of Creativity: A Case for Unrestricted Artistic ExpressionCreativity is a delicate and elusive entity that originates in a free and unencumbered mind. It is the spark that ignites the imagination, allowing artists to envision and bring to life innovative ideas that captivate and inspire audiences. However, the creative process is fragile and can be stifled by restrictions and censorship. Therefore, it is essential to grant creative artists the freedom to express their ideas without any constraints, allowing their imagination to flourish and produce truly remarkable works.Artistic freedom is not a license to offend or harm, but rather an opportunity to explore, experiment, and push boundaries. Like the media, artists have a responsibility to be mindful of the impact of their work on their audience and to avoid causing unnecessary harm or offense. This self-regulation is crucial in maintaining a balance between creative expression and social responsibility. By being aware of the potential consequences of their work, artists can ensure that their creations are thought-provoking and challenging, yet respectful and considerate of diverse perspectives.Ultimately, the freedom to create without restriction is essential for artistic growth and innovation. When artists are allowed to express themselves freely, they are able to tap into their full potential, producing works that are authentic, innovative, and impactful. By embracing artistic freedom and responsibility, we can foster a culture that values creativity, encourages experimentation, and celebrates the diversity of human expression. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of the creative mind, allowing it to flourish and enrich our lives with novel ideas, inspiring stories, and breathtaking works of art.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;"The age-old adage that co-operation and competition go hand in hand holds significant truth. These two concepts are indeed two sides of the same coin, which cannot be separated. While competition drives innovation and progress, co-operation fosters unity and collective growth. The relationship between these two concepts is intricately intertwined, and a balance between them is essential for sustainable development.Competition has undoubtedly played a crucial role in the development of science and technology. The pursuit of excellence and the desire to outdo others has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries and innovations. For instance, the competition between tech giants has driven the development of cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy. This competitive spirit has propelled human progress, and its impact cannot be overstated.However, the notion of ""your loss, my gain"" kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. This zero-sum approach to competition, where one person's gain must come at the expense of another, is detrimental to collective growth. Such an approach fosters an environment of cutthroat rivalry, where individuals prioritize their own interests over the greater good. This can lead to a breakdown in trust, cooperation, and ultimately, stagnation.In contrast, co-operation and healthy competition can coexist and complement each other. When individuals and organizations work together, sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise, they can achieve far more than they could alone. This collaborative approach can lead to mutual benefits, where all parties can gain and grow together. Ultimately, the key to success lies in striking a balance between co-operation and competition, where individuals and organizations can work together to achieve common goals, while still driving innovation and progress through healthy competition. By embracing this balance, we can create a more sustainable, harmonious, and progressive world."
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"The concept of crime and punishment has been a cornerstone of societal norms, with the primary goal of maintaining law and order. It is universally accepted that crime is always punishable, as it serves as a deterrent to potential offenders and ensures justice for victims. The method of countering criminals is rooted in retribution, which aims to punish the offender in proportion to the severity of the crime committed.In the context of retribution, capital punishment is reserved for the most heinous crimes, specifically in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. This approach underscores the gravity of such crimes and the need for a proportionate response. The rationale behind this is that when a criminal mind is aware of the quantum of punishment, they will be deterred from committing such crimes due to the fear of severe consequences.This fear is a crucial element in crime prevention, as it instills a sense of responsibility and accountability among individuals. When potential offenders are aware of the harsh punishments that await them if they commit a crime, they are less likely to engage in criminal activities. This, in turn, contributes to a safer and more secure society, where the rule of law is respected and upheld.In conclusion, the principle that crime is always punishable, with retribution as the method for countering criminals, is fundamental to the administration of justice. The careful and judicious use of capital punishment in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases, combined with the knowledge of the quantum of punishment, serves as a powerful deterrent against criminal behavior. By upholding this principle, societies can work towards reducing crime rates and fostering an environment where justice, safety, and the rule of law are paramount."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;"The traditional education system has long been debated, with some countries adopting a unique approach that allows students to take a break between high school and university studies. This break, often referred to as a ""gap year,"" is viewed as a valuable opportunity for young minds to recharge and refocus. In contrast, some countries perceive this break as a waste of time, emphasizing the importance of continuous studying from the age of 5 to 16 years.However, research suggests that a relaxation of one year can be quintessential for young minds. After over a decade of continuous studying, students can benefit from a break that allows them to explore their interests and passions. By working or traveling during this time, students can gain invaluable life experiences that help them discover their field of interest. This, in turn, can lead to a more focused and motivated approach to university studies, as students are able to pursue a field that truly aligns with their strengths and aspirations.Moreover, a gap year can provide students with the opportunity to develop important life skills, such as independence, self-reliance, and time management. By taking a break from academics, students can challenge themselves in new and unfamiliar environments, fostering personal growth and maturity. Ultimately, a gap year can be a valuable investment in a student's future, allowing them to return to their studies with renewed energy, clarity, and purpose. As such, it is essential that we recognize the benefits of a gap year and provide students with the flexibility to take a break, should they choose to do so. By doing so, we can empower young minds to make informed decisions about their educational and career pathways."
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The advent of computers has revolutionized human life, giving it a whole new dimension. The world has become increasingly dependent on these devices, and it is hard to imagine a life without them. Computers have made human life easier, more convenient, and lightning fast. With just a few clicks, we can access a vast array of information, communicate with people across the globe, and perform complex tasks with ease.The impact of computers on modern society is immense. They have transformed the way we work, learn, and entertain ourselves. From simple tasks like online banking and shopping to complex operations like medical research and space exploration, computers have become an indispensable tool. The speed and accuracy with which computers process information have saved time, reduced errors, and increased productivity.However, everything has its pros and cons. The over-reliance on computers has also led to several negative consequences. The excessive use of computers has led to health problems like eye strain, back pain, and obesity. Moreover, the dependence on computers has also made us vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data theft, and other online threats. Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements has also led to a digital divide, where those who have access to computers and the internet have a significant advantage over those who do not.In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly made human life more convenient and efficient. However, it is essential to be aware of the potential drawbacks and take necessary precautions to mitigate them. By striking a balance between the benefits and risks of computer usage, we can harness the full potential of these devices and create a better future for ourselves and the generations to come. Without computers, the world would indeed go back hundreds of years, and it is imperative that we continue to innovate and improve these devices to make the most out of their capabilities.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The concept of co-education has been a topic of discussion for a long time, with many advocating for its benefits in promoting social harmony and equality between genders. One of the significant advantages of co-education is that it helps both males and females to interact and gel well with each other, fostering a sense of mutual respect and understanding. This, in turn, breaks down stereotypes and misconceptions that often plague our society.Unfortunately, there are still many male chauvinists who believe that women are incapable of excelling in certain fields, such as mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. This kind of gender-biased approach is not only detrimental to the development of the society, but also hinders the progress of women who have the potential to make significant contributions in these areas. By excluding women from these fields, we are essentially depriving ourselves of a vast pool of talent and expertise.Co-education plays a vital role in dispelling these myths and promoting equality between genders. When boys and girls study together, they learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and develop a more nuanced understanding of each other's capabilities. This, in turn, helps to break down gender stereotypes and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society.In conclusion, co-education is essential for promoting social harmony and equality between genders. By providing a platform for boys and girls to interact and learn from each other, we can break down gender stereotypes and promote a more inclusive and equitable society. It is time for us to move beyond outdated gender-biased approaches and recognize the potential of women to excel in all fields, thereby contributing to the development and progress of our society.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The role of games in children's growth and development cannot be overstated. For years, games have played a key role in enhancing children's abilities, shaping their social skills, and influencing their emotional intelligence. As a firm believer in the benefits of traditional games, I strongly advocate that parents and educators should attach more importance to these timeless activities. Traditional games offer a multitude of benefits that are often lacking in their modern counterparts.One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster communication skills among children. Unlike modern games that are often played in solitude, traditional games encourage face-to-face interaction, teamwork, and healthy competition.

Traditional games offer a multitude of benefits that are often lacking in their modern counterparts.One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster communication skills among children. Unlike modern games that are often played in solitude, traditional games encourage face-to-face interaction, teamwork, and healthy competition. Children engaging in traditional games such as tag, hide and seek, or board games learn to express themselves, negotiate, and resolve conflicts in a constructive manner. This social interaction is essential for building strong relationships and developing emotional intelligence.In contrast, modern games are primarily developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. They are designed to be highly engaging and addictive, often at the expense of social interaction and physical activity. While modern games can have their own set of benefits, such as improving problem-solving skills or hand-eye coordination, they lack the depth and breadth of social and emotional learning provided by traditional games. Therefore, it is imperative that we prioritize traditional games in the lives of our children, ensuring they grow into well-rounded, socially adept, and emotionally intelligent individuals. By doing so, we can help them develop a strong foundation for a lifetime of healthy relationships, effective communication, and personal growth.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds has long been a topic of debate, with some arguing that the priority should be on investing in medical care and education rather than on entertainment or sports facilities. This perspective holds that providing essential services such as healthcare and education is more crucial and should be prioritized by the government. The reasoning behind this stance is straightforward: medical care and education are fundamental needs that directly impact the well-being and future of citizens, whereas entertainment and sports facilities, though beneficial for leisure and community building, are not as critical.Investing in medical care ensures that the population has access to necessary health services, as hospitals and healthcare facilities form the backbone of a nation's health infrastructure,Providing quality education, on the other hand, is essential for the intellectual and economic growth of a country. It empowers future generations with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute positively to society.In contrast, spending taxpayer money on building theaters, stadiums, or other entertainment venues can be seen as less justifiable, especially when considering that these facilities may not be accessible or useful to all members of the community. For instance,It can be argued that the government has a responsibility to allocate its resources in a way that maximizes the benefit to the greatest number of people. While entertainment and sports facilities can bring joy and a sense of community to many, they do not address the basic needs of healthcare and education in the same direct way. Therefore, prioritizing medical care and education over entertainment facilities is not only a matter of practicality but also of fairness and responsibility towards all members of society. By doing so, the government can ensure that it is providing for the essential needs of its citizens, thereby fostering a healthier, more educated, and potentially more prosperous population.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The advent of modern technological advancements has sparked concerns among some individuals that traditional techniques and lifestyles are under threat. However, this notion is far from the truth. In reality, technology plays a pivotal role in promoting and preserving traditional skills and ways of life. By leveraging technology, we can breathe new life into traditional practices, making them more accessible and appealing to a wider audience.One of the primary advantages of technology in promoting traditional skills is its ability to transcend time and space. With the help of digital platforms, social media, and online tutorials, traditional techniques can be shared and learned by people from all over the world, regardless of their geographical location. This not only helps to preserve traditional skills but also enables them to evolve and adapt to modern tastes and preferences. Furthermore, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote traditional skills, allowing artisans and practitioners to reach a larger audience and showcase their work to a global community.In addition, technology provides a range of tools and resources that can aid in the preservation and promotion of traditional lifestyles. For instance, digital archives and databases can be used to document and preserve traditional knowledge, as well as provide a platform for the sharing and exchange of ideas and techniques. Moreover, technology can also help to create new economic opportunities for traditional practitioners, allowing them to sustain themselves and their communities. In conclusion, technology is not a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles, but rather a powerful tool that can help to promote and preserve them for future generations. By embracing technology, we can ensure the continued relevance and vitality of traditional skills and ways of life.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The debate surrounding the freedom of artists has sparked intense discussion, with some advocating for government restrictions on their creative expression. However, the notion that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power is a misguided one. As a firm believer in the importance of unhindered self-expression, I strongly argue that freedom of thought and ideas should always be celebrated and protected.One of the primary concerns driving the call for restrictions on artistic freedom is the fear of social misleading, which could potentially destabilize society. Critics argue that unchecked creative expression can lead to the dissemination of harmful or misleading ideas, ultimately threatening social cohesion and stability. Nevertheless, this fear is vastly overstated and ignores the fundamental role that art plays in shaping cultural narratives and challenging societal norms.By imposing restrictions on artistic expression, the government would not only stifle creativity but also undermine the very fabric of a free and open society. Art has long been a powerful tool for social commentary, and restricting it would only serve to silence marginalized voices and maintain the status quo. Furthermore, the free exchange of ideas is essential for fostering innovation, critical thinking, and intellectual growth. Ultimately, the benefits of unrestricted artistic expression far outweigh the perceived risks. By embracing the freedom of thought and ideas, we can create a more vibrant, and inclusive society where creativity and innovation can flourish. As such, it is imperative that we continue to uphold and celebrate the rights of artists to express themselves freely, without fear of reprisal or censorship. Only through this can we truly harness the transformative power of art to shape a better world.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The portrayal of violence in the media has become a pressing concern in today's society. In an effort to attract and retain large audiences, the media often resorts to depicting violence in an extreme and sensationalized manner. While it is undeniable that violence is a harsh reality that exists in our world, it is essential to report on such incidents in a responsible and balanced way. However, the excessive portrayal of violence in the media can have far-reaching and detrimental consequences.On one hand, the media has a duty to report on factual events, including those involving violence. This is crucial in keeping the public informed and aware of the issues that affect their communities and the world at large. Nevertheless, the manner in which violence is presented is equally important. When the media prioritizes sensationalism over responsible reporting, it can lead to the dissemination of misleading information to the public.The excessive depiction of violence can distort the public's perception of reality, making it seem more violent and dangerous than it actually is. This can have a profound impact on societal attitudes and behaviors, potentially leading to increased fear, anxiety, and aggression. Moreover, it can also desensitize audiences to the real-life consequences of violence, trivializing the suffering and harm it causes. Ultimately, the glorification of violence in the media can contribute to a culture that tolerates and even promotes aggression, rather than promoting peaceful resolution of conflicts and respect for human life.In conclusion, while reporting on violence is a necessary aspect of media coverage, it is crucial that it is done in a manner that is respectful, accurate, and responsible. The media has a significant influence on societal values and behaviors, and it is imperative that it uses this influence to promote a culture of peace, empathy, and understanding, rather than one of violence and aggression.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The modern era has been marked by significant transformations in various facets of life, and one of the most notable advancements is the revolution of feminism. This movement, which aims to achieve equal rights and opportunities for women, has been a subject of debate among scholars and society at large. However,,assistant<In my opinion, the rise of feminism is a profoundly positive development in human society. By providing women with equal opportunities compared to men, a society can reap numerous benefits that far outweigh the challenges. One of the primary advantages of feminism is the promotion of gender equality, which enables women to participate fully in the social, economic, and political spheres. This, in turn, leads to a more diverse and inclusive society, where different perspectives and ideas are valued and respected.Moreover, a society that embraces feminism is likely to experience significant economic gains. When women are given equal access to education and employment opportunities, they are able to contribute to the workforce and stimulate economic growth. This can lead to increased innovation, productivity, and competitiveness, ultimately benefiting the entire society. Furthermore, feminism also plays a crucial role in promoting social justice and challenging patriarchal norms that have historically oppressed and marginalized women.While some may argue that feminism presents obstacles, such as potential backlash or resistance to change, I firmly believe that the benefits of a feminist society far outweigh these challenges. By empowering women and promoting gender equality, we can create a more just, equitable, and prosperous society for all individuals, regardless of gender. Ultimately, the revolution of feminism is a positive progress in human society, and its continued advancement is essential for building a brighter, more inclusive future for generations to come.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The implementation of price control institutions has been a common practice in various social areas, including the regulation of farming products and real estate markets. However, the effectiveness of such institutions in alleviating traffic and pollution pressures is a topic worthy of evaluation. The idea of using price control to mitigate traffic congestion and pollution is based on the principle of influencing consumer behavior through economic incentives.In the context of traffic and pollution, price control institutions could potentially play a role in reducing the number of vehicles on the road, thereby decreasing emissions and pollution. For instance, congestion pricing, a form of price control, has been implemented in several cities worldwide, where drivers are charged a fee to enter certain areas or use specific roads during peak hours. This approach aims to discourage unnecessary travel and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, walking, or cycling.However, it is crucial to acknowledge that pollution is a multifaceted issue, not solely caused by the burning of oil. Other significant contributors to pollution include chemical pollutants and excessive lighting. These factors also constitute a considerable amount of pollution and must be addressed through comprehensive strategies that go beyond price control mechanisms. For example, regulations on industrial emissions, waste management practices, and energy-efficient lighting solutions are essential components of a broader pollution reduction strategy.In conclusion, while price control institutions may offer some benefits in reducing traffic and pollution by influencing consumer behavior, their effectiveness ought to be evaluated in the context of a holistic approach to environmental sustainability. Addressing pollution requires a multifaceted strategy that includes not only economic incentives but also regulatory measures, technological innovations, and changes in individual and industrial behaviors. Only through such a comprehensive approach can we hope to significantly alleviate traffic and pollution pressures.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The primary purpose of public service advertisements is not to generate profits, but rather to disseminate valued culture, promote good moral traits, and raise awareness for social causes. These advertisements play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and promoting social responsibility. They often focus on issues such as disability awareness, poverty alleviation, and environmental conservation, with the aim of inspiring positive change and encouraging community involvement.In contrast, commercial advertisements prioritize profit over social responsibility, their primary goal being to boost sales and increase brand recognition. By publicizing a particular product or brand image, mass media can significantly enhance a company's sales and revenue. However, this approach can sometimes be seen as self-serving and lacking in social conscience.Public service advertisements, on the other hand, take on a more altruistic role, often partnering with non-profit organizations and charitable institutions to promote their causes. These advertisements not only raise awareness about important social issues but also encourage viewers to take action, contributing to the betterment of society. By promoting good moral traits and valued culture, public service advertisements help to foster a sense of community and social responsibility.In conclusion, while commercial advertisements focus on profit and brand promotion, public service advertisements prioritize social responsibility and the dissemination of valued culture. By promoting good causes and encouraging community involvement, public service advertisements play a vital role in shaping public opinion and inspiring positive change. As such, they are an essential component of a responsible and socially conscious media landscape.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In modern society, individuals often find themselves entangled in a web of difficulties, which can lead to immense stress. The pressures of work, family, and social obligations can be overwhelming, causing detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. However, I firmly believe that the most effective and suitable method for reducing stress in this chaotic world is through various forms of exercise.Engaging in physical activity not only enhances overall health conditions but also plays a pivotal role in mitigating stress levels. Exercise has been scientifically proven to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression by releasing endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones. These natural chemicals promote a sense of well-being and happiness, acting as a potent antidote to the stresses of modern life. Moreover, regular physical activity improves sleep quality, boosts energy levels, and enhances cognitive function, all of which are compromised by chronic stress.Beyond the physical benefits, exercise brings about positive emotions that are crucial for mental resilience. Activities such as jogging, cycling, or team sports offer opportunities to challenge oneself, achieve goals, and experience a sense of accomplishment. This can significantly enhance self-esteem and confidence, providing individuals with the psychological tools to tackle their daily challenges with a clearer and more positive mindset.Furthermore, the diversity of exercises available caters to all preferences and fitness levels, ensuring that everyone can find an activity that suits them. From the tranquility of yoga and tai chi to the high intensity of aerobics and weightlifting, the options are vast. This versatility allows individuals to explore different forms of exercise, keeping their routines interesting and preventing boredom, which can be a significant motivator for consistency.In conclusion, in a world where stress is an unfortunate reality for many, exercise stands out as a universally accessible and highly effective method for reducing stress. It offers a holistic approach to wellbeing, addressing both the physical and emotional aspects of health. As such, incorporating various forms of exercise into daily life can be a powerful strategy for modern people to manage their stress and cultivate a healthier, happier lifestyle."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"The age-old adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" has been a cornerstone of communication for centuries. While I concede that images have become a dominant means of conveying ideas and messages in today's world, I only partially agree with this statement. In many instances, images do serve as a more effective and efficient way of communicating complex information, emotions, and ideas. A single photograph or graphic can evoke emotions, convey a message, and tell a story in a way that words alone cannot.In today's digital age, images are omnipresent, and their impact on communication cannot be overstated. Social media platforms, as an example, are filled with images that are used to convey messages, tell stories, and share experiences. The use of emojis, memes, and infographics has become an integral part of online communication, allowing people to convey complex ideas and emotions in a concise and visually appealing way.However, the importance of the written word cannot be denied. Written communication has been the backbone of human interaction for centuries, and its significance remains unabated. The written word provides a level of permanence, clarity, and nuance that images often cannot match. Written communication allows for complexity, detail, and depth, making it an essential tool for conveying intricate ideas, telling detailed stories, and recording history.In conclusion, while images have become a powerful means of communication, the written word remains an indispensable tool for expressing ideas, telling stories, and conveying complex information. Both images and written words have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and the most effective communication often results from a combination of both. Ultimately, the choice between images and written words depends on the context, purpose, and audience, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to communication that leverages the strengths of both."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The preservation of minority languages has been a topic of debate in recent years, with some people arguing that governments should allocate a portion of their budget to protect these languages. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly, and this essay will discuss the issue. On the one hand, there are some drawbacks to saving minority languages. One of the main concerns is the financial burden it places on governments. Allocating a significant portion of the budget to preserve minority languages may divert funds away from other essential public services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.Moreover, the effort to preserve minority languages may not be effective, as the number of speakers may be too small to sustain the language. Additionally, the cost of developing educational materials, training teachers, and promoting the language may outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, in a globalized world where communication is increasingly important, the focus on minority languages may hinder the ability of individuals to learn more widely spoken languages, which are essential for international communication and economic opportunities.It is also worth considering that language is not static and is subject to change and evolution. As such, it may be more practical to allow languages to naturally evolve and adapt, rather than trying to preserve them in their current form. In conclusion, while preserving minority languages has cultural and historical significance, the potential drawbacks of such an effort need to be carefully weighed against the benefits. A more nuanced approach, considering the complexity of the issue and the potential consequences of preservation efforts, is necessary to ensure that resources are allocated effectively and efficiently.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The allocation of government funds is a crucial aspect of a country's development, and it is imperative that priorities are set to ensure the well-being of its citizens. In this regard, it is essential that the government gives priority to investing in basic social welfares such as education and housing. These fundamental necessities are the backbone of a thriving society, and their development is vital for the enhancement of the quality of people's lives.While art and culture are important aspects of a society, they are not the key determinants of quality of life. Education, on the other hand, plays a pivotal role in shaping the minds of individuals and empowering them with knowledge and wisdom. Education is the foundation upon which a well-rounded social system is built, and its importance cannot be overstated. By investing in education, the government can ensure that its citizens are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute to the development of the country.In contrast, art, although valuable, is a secondary consideration when it comes to the allocation of government funds. The primary focus should be on providing citizens with access to quality education and housing, as these are the basic necessities that guarantee a decent standard of living. Knowledge and wisdom, acquired through education, are the ultimate guarantees of a better life, and it is the responsibility of the government to provide its citizens with these essential tools. By prioritizing education and housing, the government can create a well-rounded social system that is conducive to the growth and development of its citizens, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and harmonious society.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The question of whether the government should be responsible for funding healthcare and education for its citizens is a contentious issue. On one hand, some individuals argue that it is the government's duty to provide these essential services to its citizens, as they are fundamental human rights. They believe that every citizen, regardless of their economic status, deserves access to quality healthcare and education. On the other hand, some people oppose this argument, claiming that it would be a waste of public money for the government to subsidize the health and education of each citizen. They argue that such a system would be unsustainable and would lead to an excessive burden on taxpayers. According to them, individuals should be responsible for their own healthcare and education, with the government playing a minimal role.However, I personally believe that the government should fund healthcare for the deprived. This is because healthcare is a basic necessity that everyone deserves, regardless of their financial situation. Many individuals, especially those from low-income backgrounds, struggle to access quality healthcare due to financial constraints. By funding healthcare for the underprivileged, the government can help reduce health disparities and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to lead a healthy life. Moreover, funding healthcare for the deprived can also have long-term economic benefits, as a healthier population is more productive and contributes to the overall growth of the economy. Therefore, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that the government has a moral obligation to provide healthcare to those who cannot afford it, as it is a matter of social justice and equality. By doing so, the government can help create a more equitable society where everyone has access to the essential services they need to thrive.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The debate on whether zoos should be banned has been a longstanding one, with animal-right activists strongly advocating for the abolition of these institutions. They argue that wildlife belongs in its natural environment, and that keeping animals in captivity is a violation of their rights. However, I do not agree with this viewpoint. While it is true that animals are meant to roam free in their natural habitats, I believe that a well-designed, man-made environment can provide a better alternative for many species.A good zoo can provide a safe and nurturing environment for animals that are endangered, injured, or orphaned. In such cases, captivity can actually prolong the life span of these animals, which would otherwise face certain death in the wild. Moreover, a well-managed zoo can play a crucial role in cultivating the notion of protecting animals among the general public. By providing an opportunity for people to observe and learn about various species, zoos can raise awareness about the importance of conservation and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats.Furthermore, many modern zoos have evolved to prioritize animal welfare and conservation, and are involved in breeding programs, research, and education. These institutions can also provide a platform for scientists to study animal behavior, and develop strategies for conservation and reintroduction programs. In conclusion, while I understand the concerns of animal-right activists, I firmly believe that a good man-made environment, such as a well-designed zoo, can be a better alternative for many wild animals. By providing a safe haven and promoting education and conservation, zoos can play a vital role in protecting our planet's precious wildlife.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The pursuit of economic growth in industrialized countries has sparked concerns among many that the achievement of economic targets may come at the cost of damaging the ecosystems. However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that flourishing economies and environmental preservation are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary goals that can be attained simultaneously.Unfortunately, some countries prioritize economic development over environmental protection, resulting in the degradation of local environments. The relentless drive for growth and profit can lead to the exploitation of natural resources, pollution, and habitat destruction. This not only harms the environment but also has severe consequences for the health and well-being of the population.On the other hand, many countries have successfully demonstrated that economic prosperity can be achieved while preserving the environment. By adopting sustainable practices, investing in renewable energy, and implementing eco-friendly policies, these nations have shown that economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand. In fact, preserving natural resources and ecosystems can even contribute to long-term economic stability and prosperity.It is imperative for governments and industries to recognize the importance of balancing economic development with environmental conservation. By adopting sustainable practices and prioritizing environmental protection, countries can ensure that their economic growth is not only sustainable but also equitable and environmentally responsible. Ultimately, I believe that with careful planning, cooperation, and a commitment to sustainability, it is possible to achieve economic targets while preserving the health and integrity of our ecosystems for future generations.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The allocation of tax money is a contentious issue, with some people arguing that it should be prioritized towards publicly beneficial services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. They contend that these services are essential for the well-being and development of a society, and that arts are a luxury that cannot be afforded. However, from my perspective, I firmly believe that arts should also be included in the government's investment.Arts play a vital role in shaping a society's culture, identity, and values. They have the power to inspire, educate, and unite people, fostering a sense of community and social cohesion. Moreover, arts are a significant contributor to the economy, with the creative industry generating billions of dollars in revenue each year. By investing in arts, governments can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and promote tourism.Furthermore, arts have a profound impact on our mental and emotional well-being. They provide an outlet for self-expression, creativity, and stress relief, which are essential for maintaining good mental health. In addition, arts have the ability to challenge social norms, promote critical thinking, and inspire social change. They provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard, and for social justice issues to be addressed.In conclusion, while publicly beneficial services are undoubtedly important, I strongly believe that arts should not be overlooked. They bring numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole, and their value should not be underestimated. Governments should strike a balance between investing in essential services and supporting the arts, recognizing the significant contribution that arts make to the fabric of our society. By doing so, we can create a more vibrant, diverse, and culturally rich community that benefits from the unique advantages that both publicly beneficial services and arts have to offer.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The debate surrounding zoology has sparked intense discussion among critics and advocators. On one hand, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is morally wrong. They contend that animals should be considered non-human persons, entitled to the same rights and freedoms as humans, including the right to freedom. According to this perspective, confining animals to enclosures for human entertainment or education is a form of exploitation, depriving them of their natural habitats and behaviors. Critics argue that animals have complex social and emotional lives, and captivity can cause them significant distress and harm.On the other hand, advocators of zoology believe that these institutions provide a valuable service to the public. They argue that zoos offer a unique form of entertainment and education, allowing people to connect with and learn about wildlife in a way that would be impossible in their natural habitats. Moreover, advocators claim that zoos play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecology. By participating in breeding programs, monitoring population sizes, and providing a safe haven for endangered species, zoos contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. They also support research and conservation efforts, helping to protect ecosystems and preserve the delicate balance of nature.While both perspectives have valid points, it is essential to weigh the benefits of zoos against the potential harm caused to the animals. Ultimately, a balanced approach that prioritizes animal welfare and conservation is necessary. By implementing more naturalistic and spacious enclosures, and focusing on education and conservation, zoos can work to redeem their role in society and provide a valuable service to both humans and animals.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;The Role of Advertising: Weighing its Positive and Negative ImpactsThe debate surrounding the impact of advertising on our lives has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to our lives, and therefore, it should be considered a positive activity. Advertising has enabled companies to reach a wider audience, promoting their products and services, which in turn, has driven economic growth and created employment opportunities. Moreover,On the other hand, however, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. One of the significant drawbacks of advertising is the potential for invasion of privacy. With the advancement of technology, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses. This can be seen as intrusive and annoying, as individuals may receive numerous unwanted messages, cluttering their inboxes and disrupting their daily activities. Furthermore, some advertisements may contain misleading or deceptive content, which can lead to consumers making uninformed decisions.In conclusion, while advertising has its benefits, its negative impacts cannot be ignored. It is essential to strike a balance between promoting products and services and respecting individuals' privacy and autonomy. By implementing regulations and guidelines, we can ensure that advertising is used in a responsible and ethical manner, minimizing its negative effects and maximizing its positive outcomes. Ultimately, it is crucial to acknowledge both sides of the argument and work towards creating a more transparent and consumer-friendly advertising environment.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate, with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy. On one hand, they argue that nuclear power plants can generate a significant amount of electricity with minimal environmental impact, compared to traditional fossil fuel-based power plants. Additionally, they claim that nuclear power is a reliable and constant source of energy, as it is not dependent on weather conditions like solar or wind power.However, as far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with the opponents of the usage of nuclear power. My stance is primarily due to the inherent risks and dangers associated with nuclear energy production. The potential for catastrophic accidents, such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters, cannot be ignored. These incidents have highlighted the devastating consequences of nuclear power, including radioactive contamination and long-term health effects for both humans and the environment.Furthermore, the issue of nuclear waste disposal remains a significant concern. The storage and disposal of radioactive waste pose substantial environmental and health risks, as it remains hazardous for thousands of years. The lack of a foolproof method for disposing of this waste raises serious questions about the long-term sustainability of nuclear power. In conclusion, while nuclear power may offer a source of efficient energy, the risks and uncertainties associated with its production and waste management outweigh any potential benefits. As such, I firmly believe that alternative, renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, should be prioritized and developed to meet our energy needs, ensuring a safer and more sustainable future for generations to come.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether big cities or countryside is a better place to bring up children has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the countryside provides a more peaceful and natural environment for children to grow, others claim that big cities offer a more comprehensive and stimulating environment for their development. In this essay, I will argue that big cities can be a good place for bringing up children due to the better education, creative facilities, and diverse opportunities they provide.One of the primary advantages of big cities is the access to quality education. Schools in big cities tend to have more resources, better infrastructure, and more experienced teachers, resulting in a higher standard of education compared to those in the countryside. This provides children with a solid foundation for their future academic and professional pursuits. In contrast, children living in the countryside often have limited access to educational resources and may have to travel long distances to attend school.Big cities also offer a wide range of creative facilities and activities for children to engage in, such as museums, libraries, parks, and recreational centers. These facilities provide children with opportunities to develop their skills, explore their interests, and socialize with others. In contrast, children living in the countryside often spend most of their free time helping with farm work or engaging in limited outdoor activities. While this can be beneficial in terms of teaching them about hard work and responsibility, it can also limit their exposure to new experiences and ideas.In conclusion, big cities can be a good place for bringing up children due to the better education, creative facilities, and diverse opportunities they provide. While the countryside has its own unique advantages, the benefits of city living for children's development and growth cannot be overstated. By providing children with access to quality education, creative activities, and social opportunities, big cities can help them develop into well-rounded, confident, and successful individuals.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The modern society is comprised of a diverse range of jobs, catering to various needs and requirements. These jobs are primarily undertaken by two types of entities: government-related companies and private companies. While both have their own set of advantages and disadvantages, the ultimate goal for many individuals, including myself, is to establish their own business and work for themselves.Government-related companies offer a sense of security and stability, with benefits such as job protection, fixed working hours, and a predictable income. Additionally, these companies often provide a clear hierarchy and opportunities for career advancement. On the other hand, private companies are known for their flexibility, innovation, and potential for high earnings. They often provide a dynamic work environment, with opportunities for creativity and entrepreneurship.However, despite the advantages of working for these companies, I firmly believe that having one's own business is the most desirable option. Being one's own boss allows for unparalleled autonomy, enabling individuals to make decisions, set goals, and work at their own pace. Moreover, owning a business provides an opportunity to pursue one's passion and turn it into a career, which can lead to a higher sense of job satisfaction and fulfillment.Furthermore, having one's own business allows for unlimited earning potential, as one's hard work and dedication directly translate into financial rewards. While it may come with its own set of challenges and risks, the freedom and flexibility that comes with being one's own boss are invaluable. In conclusion, although government-related and private companies have their own advantages, my ultimate aspiration is to establish my own business, where I can work for myself, pursue my passion, and reap the rewards of my hard work.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The concept of failure is an inevitable aspect of life, affecting individuals in various domains such as education, love, and economy. Many people encounter at least one significant failure throughout their lifetime. When faced with defeat, some advocate for forgetting and moving on from the experience. However, I firmly believe that individuals should not give up when confronted with failure.Giving up in the face of failure can lead to a lack of personal growth and missed opportunities for learning. Failure often serves as a catalyst for improvement, allowing individuals to identify their weaknesses and work on enhancing their skills. By acknowledging and reflecting on their mistakes, people can gain valuable insights and develop resilience, which is essential for overcoming future challenges.Moreover, perseverance in the face of failure can lead to remarkable successes. Many renowned figures, such as Thomas Edison and J.K. Rowling, have achieved greatness despite experiencing numerous failures. Their determination and refusal to give up ultimately led to groundbreaking innovations and literary masterpieces.In addition, giving up can also lead to a sense of regret and ""what ifs,"" which can haunt individuals for the rest of their lives. By persistence and hard work, people can transform their failures into stepping stones for success. It allows them to develop a growth mindset, where they view challenges as opportunities for growth, rather than threats to their ego.In conclusion, when faced with failure, individuals should not give up. Instead, they should use it as a chance to learn, reflect, and improve. By adopting a resilient and determined attitude, people can turn their failures into valuable experiences that ultimately lead to success and personal growth. It is through perseverance and persistence that individuals can unlock their true potential and achieve their goals, making failure a mere stepping stone on the path to success."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The debate surrounding endangered animals and human needs has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While it is undeniable that endangered animals play a vital role in maintaining the delicate balance of our ecosystem, it is equally important to consider the growing needs of the human population. As the global population continues to increase day by day, the demand for food and other essential resources also rises. This surge in demand necessitates the expansion of agricultural land, which often encroaches upon the natural habitats of endangered species.Furthermore, the need for shelter is a fundamental human requirement. As the population grows, so does the need for land to build houses and infrastructure. This can lead to deforestation and habitat destruction, which can have devastating consequences for endangered animals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that human beings have an inherent right to shelter and protection from the elements. The provision of housing and infrastructure is essential for human well-being and survival.In addition to food and shelter, human needs also encompass the provision of crucial comforts and amenities that are often made possible through industrial activities. The development of industries provides employment opportunities, generates economic growth, and facilitates the production of essential goods and services. While it is true that industrial activities can have negative environmental impacts, it is also important to recognize the significant benefits they provide to human societies. In conclusion, while endangered animals are undoubtedly important, human needs must take precedence. It is essential to strike a balance between conservation efforts and human development, ensuring that the needs of both are met in a sustainable and equitable manner. By prioritizing human needs, we can work towards creating a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";As human beings, we are often judged and perceived by others based on two distinct features: our appearance and our personality. While both are essential aspects of an individual, I firmly believe that personality supersedes appearance in terms of importance. On one hand, appearance is undoubtedly a significant aspect of a person. It is often the first thing that people notice when they meet someone new, and it can greatly influence the initial impression we make. A well-groomed and tidy appearance can convey a sense of responsibility and professionalism, which can be beneficial in various social and professional settings. Moreover, appearance can also reflect a person's cultural background, personal style, and attitude towards life.On the other hand, personality is the backbone of an individual's character. It encompasses a person's values, their attitude towards life, and their behavior towards others. A person with a pleasant and charismatic personality can effortlessly build strong relationships, gain people's trust, and create a positive atmosphere around them. Personality traits such as kindness, empathy, and honesty are essential in fostering deep and meaningful connections with others, and are often the foundation of long-lasting friendships and successful partnerships.In my opinion, while appearance may play a role in making a good first impression, it is personality that truly defines a person and leaves a lasting impact. A person with a beautiful appearance but a shallow or unpleasant personality will eventually be revealed for who they truly are, and their relationships will suffer as a result. In contrast, someone with a less-than-perfect appearance but a beautiful personality will often be cherished and valued by those around them. Therefore, I believe that personality is the most important feature of an individual, and it is what truly makes us who we are.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The concept of a single international language has become increasingly significant in today's globalized world. A universal language plays a pivotal role in facilitating global economic cooperation, as it enables individuals from diverse linguistic backgrounds to communicate effectively and conduct business seamlessly. The widespread adoption of a single international language, such as English, has greatly facilitated international trade, commerce, and diplomacy. It has bridged the communication gap between nations, allowing them to collaborate and negotiate on a level playing field.Moreover, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. It allows people from different cultures to exchange ideas, share knowledge, and learn from one another. This, in turn, fosters cross-cultural understanding, tolerance, and cooperation. The use of a single international language has enabled the global community to come together, promoting unity and cohesion in the face of diversity.However, while embracing a universal language, it is essential that every country preserves its own cultural heritage. The unique cultural identities and linguistic diversity of nations are what make our world rich and vibrant. Disregarding the preservation of cultural heritage would lead to a loss of traditional values, customs, and history. Each country must strike a balance between adopting a universal language for global communication and preserving its native languages and cultural practices. By doing so, nations can ensure that their cultural heritage is protected and passed down to future generations, while still participating fully in the global community. Ultimately, the coexistence of a universal language and the preservation of cultural heritage is crucial for building a harmonious and diverse global society.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The debate about the importance of personal style versus fashion trends has been ongoing for years. While some individuals believe that dressing in a personal style should be advocated, I firmly disagree. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles. This is because following trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations.Fashion trends reflect the cultural, social, and economic changes that occur in the world. By following these trends, individuals can stay connected to the global community and be aware of the latest developments. Moreover, fashion trends often influence other aspects of life, such as music, art, and entertainment. Therefore, by keeping up with fashion trends, people can gain a deeper understanding of the world around them and be more engaged with current events.In addition, fashion trends provide a means of self-expression and communication. When people follow trends, they are able to convey their values, attitudes, and personality to others. This can help to break social barriers and create a sense of community and belonging. Furthermore, fashion trends can also boost a person's confidence and self-esteem, as wearing the latest styles can make them feel more attractive and connected to others.In conclusion, while personal style is important, I believe that fashion trends have a more significant role to play in people's lives. By following trends, individuals can stay connected to the world, express themselves, and boost their confidence. Therefore, I think that fashion trends should be advocated and encouraged, as they have the power to bring people together and create a sense of unity and shared experience.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";Wealthy nations have a moral obligation to share their fortune with the poor. It is inhumane to watch one's fellow man struggle against famine and poverty, knowing that we have the means to alleviate their suffering. The stark contrast between the opulence of the rich and the desperation of the poor is a stark reminder of the need for global solidarity.As humans, we have a responsibility to care for one another, regardless of geographical boundaries or economic status. It is our duty to ensure that everyone has access to the basic necessities of life, including food, shelter, and healthcare. By sharing their wealth, wealthy nations can help bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots, creating a more equitable and just world.Moreover, economically speaking, providing aid to poor nations can also create a win-win situation. When wealthy nations invest in the development of poorer countries, they create new markets, stimulate economic growth, and foster global trade. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic opportunities, job creation, and a rise in living standards, ultimately benefiting both the donor and recipient countries. Furthermore, a more prosperous and stable global economy can also lead to a reduction in migration, conflict, and social unrest, creating a more peaceful and secure world for all.In conclusion, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor. Not only is it a moral imperative, but it also makes economic sense. By providing aid and investing in the development of poorer nations, wealthy countries can create a more equitable, prosperous, and peaceful world, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential. It is time for the global community to come together and address the scourge of poverty, ensuring that no one has to suffer from hunger, poverty, or deprivation.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The significance of health education cannot be overstated, as it has a profound impact on the well-being of future generations. By imparting essential knowledge and skills, health education empowers individuals to protect themselves from the risks of diseases, thereby causing long-term positive effects on our next generations. This proactive approach enables people to make informed decisions about their health, adopting healthy lifestyles and practices that foster overall wellness.Health education serves as a vital tool in preventing illnesses, rather than treating them. By disseminating critical information on preventative measures, individuals can take steps to mitigate the risk of contracting diseases. This, in turn, helps to improve the general health state of all citizens, leading to a reduction in morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, preventative measures such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and healthy eating habits can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare systems.It is also economically prudent to invest in health education, as the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention. By educating people on healthy habits and disease prevention, we can avoid the financial burden associated with treating illnesses. This approach not only saves lives but also reduces the economic strain on individuals, families, and the healthcare system as a whole. In conclusion, health education is a crucial investment in the health and wellbeing of current and future generations. By preparing people with the necessary knowledge to protect themselves from diseases and adopting preventative measures, we can create a healthier, more resilient, and economically sustainable society. Ultimately, the benefits of health education far outweigh the costs, making it an essential component of any comprehensive healthcare strategy.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The advent of news media has sparked a heated debate about its impact on society. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits, citing concerns about the spread of misinformation, the erosion of attention span, and the potential for biased reporting. However, it is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people's knowledge, providing them with a deeper understanding of current events, cultural trends, and global issues.On one hand, the entertainment value of news media cannot be overstated. With the rise of 24-hour news cycles and online streaming, people can now access a vast array of news programs, documentaries, and talk shows that cater to diverse interests and preferences. This has made news consumption a more engaging and enjoyable experience, allowing people to stay informed while also being entertained.On the other hand, the educational value of news media is equally significant.

Moreover, news media often features expert analysis, interviews, and documentaries that offer unique insights and perspectives, thereby enriching people's knowledge and broadening their understanding of various subjects.Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that the development of news media is a positive one. While it is true that news media has its drawbacks, its benefits in terms of entertainment and education cannot be ignored. As news media continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that its positive impact on society will only continue to grow, making it an essential part of modern life. Ultimately, a balanced and nuanced view of news media recognizes both its limitations and its potential to inform, educate, and entertain, highlighting its importance in today's interconnected world.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;International sporting occasions, such as the Football World Cup, have a profound impact on global relations, as they possess the unique ability to remarkably reduce international tensions and promote national pride in a safe and healthy manner. These events embody the spirit of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, fostering an environment where nations can strengthen their understanding, friendship, and solidarity.The Football World Cup, in particular, is a prime example of how sports can bring people together, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers. As athletes from diverse backgrounds compete with one another, they demonstrate their skills, dedication, and passion, inspiring their fellow countrymen and women to take pride in their achievements. This collective sense of pride and belonging is not limited to the athletes themselves, but also resonates deeply with the spectators, who come together to cheer on their national teams.Sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. The display of national flags, the singing of national anthems, and the donning of national jerseys all serve as powerful symbols of national identity and unity. As people from different nations gather to watch and participate in these events, they are reminded of their shared humanity and the values that unite them, such as the pursuit of excellence, the importance of fair play, and the joy of competition.In conclusion, international sporting occasions like the Football World Cup have the remarkable ability to reduce international tensions, promote national pride, and foster global understanding and solidarity. By embracing the spirit of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, these events provide a unique platform for nations to come together, celebrate their differences, and strengthen their bonds. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the role of sports in promoting peace, unity, and national pride will only continue to grow in importance.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;The debate on whether children should be engaged in paid work from a young age has sparked intense discussion globally. In many countries, children are educated to be independent and responsible for their actions, with some being encouraged to take on part-time jobs. However,, some people argue that this is not a good educational measure, citing potential negative impacts on their academic and social development. From my point of view, the benefits of children's engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.Engaging in paid work from a young age teaches children valuable life skills such as time management, budgeting, and responsibility. These skills are essential for their future careers and personal lives. Moreover, earning their own money gives children a sense of independence and self-worth, motivating them to work harder and strive for their goals. It also helps them understand the value of money and the importance of saving, which is a crucial lesson for their financial literacy.Furthermore, part-time jobs provide children with opportunities to develop social skills, such as communication and teamwork, which are vital in any profession. They learn to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, handle conflicts, and build strong relationships. These social skills, combined with the academic knowledge they acquire in school, make them well-rounded individuals prepared for the challenges of the real world.While some may argue that paid work distracts children from their studies, I believe that with proper time management, children can balance both their jobs and academic responsibilities. In fact, the discipline and commitment required for part-time work can enhance their academic performance by teaching them prioritization and hard work ethics.In conclusion, the benefits of children's engagement in paid work, including the development of life skills, independence, and social skills, outweigh the potential drawbacks. With the right balance and support, children can thrive in both their academic and professional pursuits, setting them up for a successful and responsible adulthood.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, it has become an increasingly popular trend for students to take a break before embarking on their university studies. This gap year, as it is often referred to, offers students a unique opportunity to explore their interests, gain valuable life experiences, and develop essential skills that will benefit them in the long run. Many students use this time to travel to different parts of the world, immersing themselves in diverse cultures and meeting people from all walks of life. This experience not only broadens their perspective but also enhances their confidence and independence.Others choose to take up a job during this period, which provides them with hands-on experience and a chance to develop valuable skills such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. The experience gained through traveling, meeting new people, and working is invaluable and goes a long way in shaping the student's personality and preparing them for the challenges of university life. By stepping out of their comfort zone and taking on new challenges, students become more self-assured, resilient, and adaptable.Moreover, taking a break before starting university studies allows students to reflect on their goals, aspirations, and motivations, helping them to make informed decisions about their academic and career paths. It also gives them a chance to recharge and refocus, ensuring that they approach their university studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm. In conclusion, taking a break before starting university studies is a trend that offers numerous benefits, from enhancing confidence and independence to gaining valuable life experiences and developing essential skills. As such, it is an option that students should seriously consider, as it has the potential to make a significant and positive impact on their academic and personal lives.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's fast-paced and competitive world, it is often emphasized that acquiring a plethora of knowledge and skills is essential for achieving success. I partially concur with this viewpoint, as it is undeniable that education and skill-building play a significant role in many professional pursuits. However, I also believe that there are exceptions to this rule, and that success is not solely dependent on formal education.While universities and colleges provide valuable learning experiences and opportunities for personal growth, there are certain fields where formal education may not be a prerequisite for success. The entertainment and sports industries are prime examples of this. Many renowned actors,For instance, have risen to fame without the need for a university degree. Their talent, dedication, and perseverance have been the key factors in their success. Similarly, in the sports sector, athletes often rely on their innate abilities, rigorous training, and mental toughness to excel in their respective disciplines. In these fields, experience, passion, and natural aptitude can be more important than academic credentials.Moreover, the rise of self-taught entrepreneurs and online personalities has also highlighted the fact that success can be achieved through alternative means. With the abundance of online resources and tutorials available, individuals can now acquire skills and knowledge in a more flexible and autonomous manner. This has democratized access to information and opportunities, allowing people to pursue their passions and interests without being bound by traditional educational pathways.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of knowledge and skills in achieving success, I also believe that there are multiple paths to reaching one's goals. The examples of entertainment and sports sectors demonstrate that success is not exclusively tied to formal education, and that talent, diligence can also lead to remarkable achievements.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we access and interact with art and historical objects. With just a few clicks, we can now view and explore vast collections of artworks and artifacts from the comfort of our own homes. This has led some to question the relevance of public museums and art galleries in the digital age. However, despite the convenience of online access, these institutions will still be necessary for providing a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replicated on a screen.While it is true that most people nowadays prefer to use the internet to search for artworks, as it brings them convenience and ease of access, this method of viewing has its limitations. Pictures online are limited to a screen size, which cannot compare to the real-life experience of viewing a piece of art or historical object in person. The internet may provide a wealth of information and images, but it cannot replace the spiritual experience of standing in front of a masterpiece, feeling its texture, and being surrounded by its presence.Public museums and art galleries offer a sensory experience that goes beyond the visual. They provide a space for contemplation, reflection, and connection with the art and artifacts on display. The physical presence of a artwork or historical object can evoke emotions, inspire imagination, and create a sense of wonder that is difficult to replicate in a digital environment. Furthermore, museums and galleries often provide interactive exhibitions, guided tours, and educational programs that enhance the viewing experience and foster a deeper understanding of the artworks and artifacts.In conclusion, while the internet has made it possible to access art and historical objects from anywhere, public museums and art galleries will still be necessary for providing a unique and immersive experience that cannot be replaced by digital viewing. They offer a spiritual and sensory experience that is essential for a deeper understanding and appreciation of art and history.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;"The role of a jury in the judicial system is to provide an impartial verdict based on the evidence presented in court. However, in many countries, the jury is provided with the history of the defendant, which can potentially influence their decision. This is not the case in the UK and Australia, where the jury is only given information relevant to the specific case at hand. Many people believe that a person's past behavior is a reliable indicator of their future actions, and therefore, providing the jury with a defendant's history can be seen as relevant to the case. However, this approach can lead to biased decision-making, as the jury may be swayed by information that is not directly related to the current charges. In order for the jury to come up with an objective decision, it is essential that they are only provided with details that are relevant to the particular case. This ensures that the verdict is based solely on the evidence presented, rather than on the defendant's past mistakes or actions. By limiting the information provided to the jury, the court can help to prevent prejudice and ensure a fair trial. Furthermore, providing the jury with a defendant's history can also lead to a phenomenon known as ""confirmation bias"", where the jury interprets the evidence in light of their preconceived notions about the defendant. This can result in an unjust verdict, as the jury may be more likely to convict a defendant with a prior record, regardless of the evidence presented. In conclusion, while many people believe that a defendant's past behavior is relevant to their future actions, providing the jury with this information can lead to biased decision-making. The courts in the UK and Australia have the right approach, by only providing the jury with details relevant to the particular case, ensuring a fair and objective trial."
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. While some argue that the Internet has revolutionized the education system, others claim that it has a detrimental effect on students' learning outcomes. However, in the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about.On the one hand, the Internet provides students with a vast array of educational resources, including online libraries, educational websites, and multimedia materials. These resources enable students to access information quickly and efficiently, thereby enhancing their learning experience. Moreover, the Internet facilitates online collaboration and communication among students, teachers, and peers, promoting a more interactive and engaging learning environment.On the other hand, critics may argue that the Internet has several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively. For instance, excessive Internet usage can lead to distractions, decreased attention span, and poor time management skills among students. Additionally, the Internet can also be a source of misinformation, plagiarism, and academic dishonesty. Nevertheless, these drawbacks can be mitigated through proper guidance, supervision, and education on responsible Internet usage.In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks, the benefits of the Internet in education far outweigh the costs. As technology continues to advance, it is imperative that educational institutions harness the power of the Internet to provide students with a comprehensive and effective learning experience. By doing so, students will be equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in an increasingly digital world. Ultimately, the Internet will play a vital role in shaping the future of education, and its integration into academic training will be indispensable for the development of a knowledgeable and skilled workforce.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The issue of medication affordability in poor countries has sparked a heated debate. It is disheartening to note that a large number of patients in these countries are succumbing to deaths caused by the lack of medication rather than the severity of the diseases themselves. This has led to calls for companies in developed countries to reduce the prices of their medicines, with the aim of preventing such unnecessary deaths. However, a closer examination of the situation reveals that the current cost of medicines is, in fact, reasonable and based on their effectiveness.The development and production of medicines involve significant investment in research, testing, and manufacturing. Pharmaceutical companies in developed countries spend billions of dollars on researching and developing new treatments, which is a costly and time-consuming process. The prices of medicines are determined by these costs, as well as the value they bring to patients in terms of improved health outcomes and extended lifespan. Reducing the prices of medicines without considering these factors could undermine the ability of pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new treatments, ultimately harming patients in the long run.Moreover, the effectiveness of medicines is a key factor in determining their prices. Medicines that are highly effective in treating certain diseases or conditions are naturally more expensive due to the value they provide to patients. It is unfair to expect pharmaceutical companies to compromise on the quality and effectiveness of their medicines in order to reduce prices. Instead, efforts should focus on finding alternative solutions, such as subsidies, donations, or partnerships between governments, NGOs, and pharmaceutical companies, to make medicines more accessible to those in need. By adopting such approaches, we can work towards making medicines more affordable for patients in poor countries without compromising on their quality and effectiveness.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The growing awareness among the general public about the harmful effects of smoking has led to significant pressure on both the government and private sectors. As a result, numerous businesses have taken the initiative to prohibit smoking within their premises,. Furthermore, some governments have also implemented restrictions on smoking in public areas. This movement is a positive step towards a healthier and more image-conscious nation.The harmful effects of smoking are well-documented, and the general public's awareness of these risks has sparked a desire for change. By prohibiting smoking in their premises, businesses are not only protecting the health of their employees and customers but also promoting a positive image of their company. Similarly, governments that restrict smoking in public areas are demonstrating their commitment to the well-being of their citizens and the overall image of their nation.In the long run, this move is expected to yield numerous benefits. For one, the quality of health among the population is likely to improve, as fewer people will be exposed to second-hand smoke and the temptation to smoke will be reduced. Additionally, the image of a nation that prioritizes the health and well-being of its citizens is likely to be boosted, both domestically and internationally. This, in turn, can lead to increased tourism, foreign investment, and economic growth.In conclusion, the pressure from the general public to address the harmful effects of smoking has led to positive changes in both the private and public sectors. By prohibiting smoking in premises and restricting it in public areas, businesses and governments are promoting a healthier and more positive image of their nation. As this movement continues to grow, it is likely to have a significant impact on the quality of health and image of a nation in the long run.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The phrase ""Save the planet Earth"" has become a rallying cry that resonates across the globe. It is a stark reminder of the pressing need to take collective action to preserve our planet. The concerns to save Earth are multifaceted and vital, due to various compelling reasons. One of the primary concerns is the alarming rate of environmental degradation caused by human activities.The large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants such as air conditioners have had a devastating impact on the ozone layer. The ozone layer, which acts as a protective shield against harmful ultraviolet radiation, has been significantly depleted. This depletion has far-reaching consequences, including increased risk of skin cancer, increased cataracts, and disrupted ecosystems. The damage to the ozone layer is a stark warning sign that our actions are having a profound impact on the planet's delicate ecosystem.Moreover, the excessive use of air conditioners and other cooling appliances has contributed to the escalating levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change. Rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are just a few of the catastrophic consequences of our actions. It is imperative that we take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint and transition to more sustainable and eco-friendly technologies.In conclusion, the phrase ""Save the planet Earth"" is not just a slogan, but a call to action. It is a reminder that our actions have consequences and that we must take collective responsibility to mitigate the damage that has been done. By making conscious choices to reduce our carbon emissions, conserving energy, and adopting sustainable practices, we can work towards preserving the planet for future generations. It is our moral obligation to save the planet Earth and ensure a livable and thriving world for years to come."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The notion of sacrificing senior members to save younger workers has been a topic of debate in recent years. However, this approach poses several negative influences on both the individual and societal levels. From a personal perspective, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. Senior members who have dedicated their lives to their careers and contributed significantly to the organization are suddenly forced into early retirement, often without a choice. This can lead to feelings of betrayal, resentment, and disappointment among the older generation, who may feel that their years of service and experience are being undervalued.Moreover, massively forcing early retirement would also be a significant financial burden to the local government. Senior members who are forced into early retirement may not have sufficient savings or pension plans to support themselves, leading to an increased reliance on government assistance programs. This can put a strain on the local government's resources, as they would need to provide financial support to these individuals, which could have been avoided if they were allowed to continue working. Additionally, the loss of experienced and skilled workers can also have a negative impact on the organization, as their knowledge and expertise are lost, potentially leading to a decline in productivity and efficiency.In conclusion, sacrificing senior members to save younger workers is not a viable solution. It not only creates a sense of unfairness and resentment among the older generation but also poses significant financial and societal burdens. Instead, organizations should focus on finding alternative solutions that value and respect the contributions of all employees, regardless of age. By doing so, they can promote a more positive and inclusive work environment, where employees of all ages can thrive and contribute to the organization's success.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The debate surrounding the correct amount of control to be imposed on mass media, including newspapers, televisions, and websites, has been a longstanding and contentious issue. One of the primary arguments in favor of tighter media control is the need to limit the dissemination of violent and sexual content. Proponents of stricter control argue that such content can have a corrosive influence on society, particularly on younger audiences, contributing to desensitization and potentially even mimetic behavior. By regulating what is broadcast or published, governments can help protect vulnerable populations from harmful media exposure.Another reason that supports tighter control is the importation of foreign programs by television companies. These programs may carry cultural values, norms, or ideologies that are not aligned with the importing country's, potentially influencing audiences in unforeseen ways. By exerting control over media content, the government can ensure that the ideas and values promoted through media are more in line with national interests and cultural identity.However, the major opposing argument to increased media control is the concern over protecting the freedom of expression and the safety of citizens through access to unbiased information. Overly restrictive media control can lead to censorship, undermining the ability of the press to hold those in power accountable. This can have far-reaching consequences, including the suppression of dissenting voices and the limitation of access to critical information, which is essential for a well-informed citizenry. In the interest of protecting citizens, it is crucial to strike a balance between controlling harmful content and preserving the freedom of the press. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a media environment that is both safe and informative, allowing citizens to make informed decisions without being exposed to harmful influences. Achieving this balance is key to fostering a healthy and well-functioning democracy.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The role of citizens in a society is a topic of ongoing debate. While some individuals believe that paying taxes is the sole responsibility of citizens, others argue that being a member of society entails a broader range of duties. In reality, the development and prosperity of a country depend on its citizens taking on a multitude of responsibilities. One of the primary obligations of citizens is to obey the laws imposed by the government. Laws are put in place to maintain social order, protect the rights of individuals, and ensure the smooth functioning of society. By adhering to these laws, citizens demonstrate their respect for the system and contribute to the stability of the nation. Moreover, laws often serve as a framework for social behavior, guiding citizens towards actions that benefit the collective good.Beyond obedience to laws, citizens also have a responsibility to protect and preserve the country's culture and history. Cultural heritage is a unique aspect of a nation's identity, encompassing its customs, traditions, and historical landmarks. It is the duty of citizens to respect, learn from, and pass on this heritage to future generations. This not only fosters a sense of national pride and unity but also enriches the society with diverse perspectives and values.In conclusion, being a responsible citizen involves far more than just paying taxes. It encompasses a range of activities and mindsets, from complying with legal frameworks to safeguarding cultural and historical assets. By embracing these responsibilities, citizens play a pivotal role in the development and advancement of their country. Active and engaged citizenship is essential for building a prosperous, harmonious, and progressive society, where individuals can thrive and contribute to the greater good. Ultimately, the collective efforts of citizens are what shape the destiny of a nation, underscoring the importance of recognizing and fulfilling the multifaceted responsibilities that come with being a member of society.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The debate surrounding animal testing has been a contentious issue for many years. On one hand, numerous medical treatments have been discovered through animal testing, including life-saving cancer and HIV drugs. These breakthroughs have undoubtedly improved the lives of millions of people worldwide and have led to significant advancements in medical research. However, despite these benefits, the arguments against animal testing are compelling and warrant serious consideration.One of the primary reasons why animal testing should be banned is that the costs outweigh the benefits. The harm and suffering inflicted on animals in laboratories far exceeds any potential benefits that may be derived from these experiments. Furthermore, animals are often kept in unnatural and inhumane conditions, which can lead to significant stress and distress. This raises important ethical concerns about the treatment and welfare of these animals.Moreover, with the advancement of technology, alternative methods to animal testing are becoming increasingly available. These methods, such as computer simulations and in vitro testing, can provide similar, if not better, results without the need for animal subjects. Therefore, it can be argued that animal testing is no longer a necessary evil, but rather an outdated and inhumane practice.In conclusion, while animal testing has led to significant medical breakthroughs, the costs and ethical concerns associated with this practice cannot be ignored. The benefits of animal testing do not justify the harm and suffering inflicted on animals, and alternative methods are becoming increasingly available. As a society, we should prioritize compassion and welfare, and work towards a future where animal testing is no longer necessary. By doing so, we can promote a more humane and ethical approach to medical research, and one that does not rely on the suffering of innocent animals.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";The role of examinations in education systems worldwide has been a longstanding tradition, with many institutions relying on them as a primary method of measuring learning. Examinations are a ubiquitous feature of modern education, and their use is widespread across the globe. One of the primary advantages of examinations is that they help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. This standardized approach allows for a level playing field, where students are assessed based on their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, rather than their background or personal circumstances.By administering exams in a controlled environment, the playing field is leveled, and all students have an equal opportunity to demonstrate their skills and knowledge. This fairness is particularly important in competitive educational settings, where students are vying for limited spots in prestigious institutions or programs. Furthermore, examinations provide a clear and objective measure of student learning, allowing educators to assess the effectiveness of their teaching methods and identify areas where students may require additional support.However, despite these advantages, many educators and experts believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered. Some argue that the high-stakes nature of exams can lead to undue stress and anxiety for students, which can negatively impact their performance and overall well-being. Others suggest that exams do not provide a comprehensive picture of a student's abilities, as they only test a narrow range of skills and knowledge. As the education system continues to evolve, it is essential to reevaluate the role of examinations and consider alternative assessment methods that can provide a more nuanced and accurate measure of student learning. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the benefits and drawbacks of examinations is necessary to ensure that students are adequately prepared for success in their academic and professional pursuits.
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of poorer nations is a pressing concern that requires a multifaceted approach. Three essential components that can propel these nations towards prosperity are health, education, and trade. Richer nations can play a vital role in supporting the growth of these countries by providing crucial assistance in these areas.In the health sector, richer nations can make a significant impact by delegating doctors and nurses to poorer nations. This can help address the severe shortage of medical professionals in these countries, which often leads to inadequate healthcare services. Additionally, donating money to build hospitals and healthcare infrastructure can greatly improve the quality of medical care available to the population. This can lead to a reduction in mortality rates, an increase in life expectancy, and a overall improvement in the well-being of the people.Education is another critical area where richer nations can contribute to the development of poorer nations. By offering scholarships and loans to qualified students, richer countries can provide opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to acquire quality education. This can empower them to become leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators who can drive economic growth and social progress in their home countries. Moreover, the exchange of ideas and cultures that occurs through educational exchanges can foster greater understanding and cooperation between nations.In conclusion, the development of poorer nations requires a concerted effort from richer countries in the areas of health, education, and trade. By providing medical assistance, educational opportunities, and trade partnerships, richer nations can help create a more equitable and prosperous world. It is our collective responsibility to support the growth and development of all nations, and by working together, we can create a brighter future for generations to come.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;The role of teachers in the educational system extends far beyond the traditional notion of imparting knowledge. They are not just teachers, but also friends and counselors who play a multifaceted role in the lives of their students. While technology has advanced to the point where computers and artificial intelligence can process and convey vast amounts of information, they lack the personal touch and emotional intelligence that a human teacher can provide.A computer, no matter how sophisticated, can never fully replace the role of a teacher. It cannot communicate with pupils in the same way a human can, understanding their emotional nuances, their struggles, and their triumphs. Computers lack empathy, a crucial element in building relationships and trust with students. They cannot offer a comforting word, a reassuring smile, or a firm but gentle guidance that a teacher can. Moreover, computers cannot be role models in the way teachers are. Students look up to their teachers not just for academic guidance but also for life lessons, values, and morals. Teachers model behaviors, attitudes, and work ethics that are essential for students' personal and professional development.The relationship between a teacher and a student is built on mutual respect, trust, and understanding, which a computer system, no matter how advanced, cannot replicate. Teachers adapt their teaching methods to meet the individual needs of their students, something that automated systems struggle to do. They can sense when a student is struggling, not just with the material, but perhaps with personal issues, and can offer support or direct them to resources that can help. In essence, while technology can be a powerful tool in education, it is the human element that teachers bring to the classroom that makes the educational experience rich, personalized, and impactful. Teachers are indispensable in providing the holistic education that prepares students not just academically, but socially and emotionally for their future.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The advent of advanced plant foods and newly developed devices has revolutionized the agricultural sector, significantly reducing the cost of producing farm products. These innovative technologies have enabled farmers to increase crop yields, improve efficiency, and minimize waste. As a result, the cost of production has decreased, making farm products more affordable and accessible to consumers. Furthermore, high-tech fertilizers have been developed to enhance crop growth and resistance to diseases, leading to higher productivity and better quality produce.However, the extensive use of high-tech fertilizers poses a potential threat to individuals' health and well-being. The chemicals used in these fertilizers can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to long-term health problems. Prolonged exposure to these chemicals has been linked to various health issues, including respiratory problems, cancer, and neurological disorders. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of advanced plant foods and the potential risks associated with high-tech fertilizers.Moreover, excessive reliance on electronic equipment for harvest can have several impacts on society. While these devices have increased efficiency and reduced labor costs, they have also led to job losses and changes in traditional farming practices. The over-reliance on technology can also lead to a loss of traditional skills and knowledge, making farmers dependent on technology and vulnerable to equipment failures. Additionally, the increased use of electronic equipment can contribute to environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources. In conclusion, while advanced plant foods and newly developed devices have transformed the agricultural sector, it is crucial to address the potential risks and impacts associated with their use to ensure a sustainable and healthy food production system.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The notion that governments should cease funding for artists has sparked a heated debate in recent times. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several compelling reasons. Firstly, art plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of our lives, fostering a sense of community and promoting cultural expression. By funding artists, governments enable them to create thought-provoking and aesthetically pleasing works that enrich our public spaces, museums, and galleries. This, in turn, contributes to a more vibrant and dynamic society, where creativity and self-expression are valued and encouraged.Moreover, art has a significant impact on the tourism industry, attracting visitors from around the world and generating substantial revenue for local economies. Iconic landmarks, museums, and cultural festivals are often the main draws for tourists, and governments that invest in the arts can reap substantial economic benefits. For instance, cities like Paris, Rome, and New York, which are renowned for their rich cultural heritage and artistic treasures, attract millions of visitors each year, injecting billions of dollars into their economies. By continuing to fund artists, governments can ensure that these cultural attractions remain a drawcard, thereby supporting local businesses, creating jobs, and stimulating economic growth.In conclusion, the argument that governments should not fund artists is misguided and short-sighted. Art is an essential component of a healthy and thriving society, and its benefits extend far beyond the artistic community. By continuing to invest in the arts, governments can promote cultural expression, drive tourism, and enhance the overall quality of life for their citizens. As such, I firmly believe that governments should maintain their funding for artists, recognizing the invaluable contribution that art makes to our collective well-being and economic prosperity.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The debate about whether technology is a hindrance or a help to the environment has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people argue that if humans were to stop using technology and adopt a simple way of life, the environment could be saved. They believe that the reduction in pollution, industrial waste, and carbon emissions that would result from a more primitive lifestyle would be beneficial to the planet. However, this perspective overlooks the numerous benefits that technology has to offer in the pursuit of environmental sustainability.On the other hand, there are those who firmly believe that technology alone holds the key to solving the world's environmental problems. They point to the numerous innovations that have been made in the fields of renewable energy, sustainable materials, and eco-friendly manufacturing processes. Indeed, we are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. Advances in fields such as solar energy, wind power, and green architecture are revolutionizing the way we live and interact with the environment.Moreover, technology has enabled us to monitor and understand the environment in ways that were previously impossible. Satellite imaging, sensors, and data analytics are allowing us to track climate patterns, deforestation, and wildlife populations with unprecedented accuracy. This information is crucial in informing policy decisions and guiding conservation efforts. Therefore, it is clear that technology is not the enemy of the environment, but rather a powerful tool that can be harnessed to protect and preserve it. By embracing innovation and technological advancements, we can create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The salaries of professional athletes and entertainers have long been a topic of debate. While some people believe that their multi-million dollar salaries are reasonable, others argue that these figures do not accurately reflect their contributions to society. On one hand, the exceptional abilities of athletes and singers set them apart from the general population, and their talents bring immense joy and entertainment to millions of people worldwide. According to this perspective, their salaries are a fair reflection of the value they bring to the entertainment industry.On the other hand, critics argue that the contributions of athletes and singers are insignificant compared to other professions that have a more direct and tangible impact on society. For instance, teachers, doctors, and scientists often earn significantly lower salaries despite their crucial roles in shaping young minds, saving lives, and advancing human knowledge. This disparity raises questions about the true value of entertainment in society. Some people claim that the massive salaries of athletes and singers are a reflection of societal priorities that are misguided, where fame and entertainment are valued over more substantive contributions.Ultimately, the debate surrounding the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers highlights the complexities of determining the value of different professions. While their talents are undeniable, it is essential to consider the broader social implications of how we compensate different fields of work. By reevaluating our priorities and the criteria by which we measure an individual's worth to society, we can work towards creating a more balanced and equitable system that rewards meaningful contributions in a fair and reasonable manner.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The notion that internet and computers will soon replace the traditional role of teachers has sparked a heated debate in recent years. Proponents of this idea argue that the global online network is an inexhaustible source of information, making it possible for students to access a vast array of educational resources without the need for human instructors. With just a few clicks, students can access a wealth of knowledge, from online textbooks and educational videos to interactive learning platforms and virtual tutorials.However, critics of this idea maintain that while the internet does offer undeniable educational benefits, there are still significant shortcomings to relying solely on technology for learning. For instance, the internet lacks the human touch and personalized attention that a teacher can provide. A computer program or online resource cannot replicate the nuances of human interaction, such as reading nonverbal cues, providing emotional support, and offering tailored guidance. Furthermore, the internet is not always a reliable source of information, with misinformation and biases prevalent online.Moreover, teachers play a vital role in fostering critical thinking, creativity, and social skills, which are essential for students' overall development. They help students to analyze and evaluate information, to ask questions, and to develop well-informed opinions. In contrast, online resources often present information in a static and passive manner, failing to engage students in the same way that a skilled teacher can. Therefore, while the internet and computers are valuable tools in education, they are not a replacement for the expertise, guidance, and support that a teacher provides. Instead, they should be seen as complementary resources that can enhance the learning experience, rather than supplanting the traditional role of teachers.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"The debate over capital punishment has been a longstanding and contentious issue in many countries. On one hand, the death penalty can be seen as an effective means of retribution and deterrence in a world where heinous crimes need to be condemned. The notion that a brutal crime can be met with a equally severe punishment may serve as a warning to potential offenders, thereby maintaining social order and upholding justice.However, as society evolves and human rights become increasingly respected, the idea of ""murdering"" criminals becomes morally reprehensible and difficult to justify. The sanctity of human life is a fundamental principle that underlies the concept of human rights, and the state-sponsored taking of a life is seen as a violation of this principle. Many argue that capital punishment is a form of revenge rather than a genuine attempt at justice, and that it undermines the values of compassion, forgiveness, and rehabilitation that are essential to a humane and civilized society.Furthermore, the implementation of capital punishment raises concerns about its fairness, accuracy, and potential for error. The risk of executing an innocent person is a haunting prospect that highlights the fallibility of the justice system. As our understanding of human rights and dignity expands, it becomes increasingly clear that capital punishment is an outdated and inhumane practice that has no place in modern society. Instead, alternative forms of punishment that prioritize rehabilitation, restitution, and community safety should be explored, as they offer a more constructive and humane approach to addressing crime and promoting social justice. Ultimately, the abolition of capital punishment is a necessary step towards a more just, compassionate, and enlightened world."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The establishment of companies, factories, and businesses is driven by the dual goals of providing essential products to meet people's needs and generating profits for their managers. This fundamental aspect of commerce is undeniable. However, the unchecked operation of these entities poses significant risks to the well-being of living organisms, including humans, animals, and plants. Without adequate control and regulation, the potential for harm is substantial.If businesses are allowed to operate without constraints, they may prioritize profit margins over product quality and safety. This could lead to the production of low-quality goods at inflated prices, exploiting consumers and undermining trust in the market. Furthermore, the environmental impact of unregulated business practices can be devastating, with pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change threatening the very existence of species and ecosystems.The consequences of such actions are far-reaching and can have lasting effects on human health, biodiversity, and the planet as a whole. For instance, the release of toxic chemicals into the environment can contaminate water sources, soil, and air, leading to severe health issues in humans and wildlife. Similarly, the exploitation of natural resources without sustainable practices can lead to their depletion, compromising the survival of countless species that depend on these resources.Therefore, it is imperative that regulatory measures are put in place to ensure that businesses operate in a manner that is not only profitable but also responsible and sustainable. This includes adherence to environmental standards, consumer protection laws, and ethical business practices. By implementing and enforcing such controls, we can mitigate the risks associated with unregulated business activities and foster an economic model that prioritizes both profit and the preservation of life on Earth.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The high school in our district has been a staple of our community for many years, but unfortunately, it has become outdated and inadequate for the needs of its students. The current facility lacks the necessities that are essential for a productive and successful learning environment. However, with the upcoming construction of a new high school, our community is on the cusp of a significant transformation.The new high school will not only provide a modern and well-equipped space for students to learn and grow, but it will also serve as a hub for connection and unity among the diverse communities and districts of our city. By bringing together students from different backgrounds and neighborhoods, the new high school will foster a sense of inclusivity and cooperation, allowing students to form new relationships and friendships that transcend geographical boundaries.This intermingling of students from different districts will have a profound impact on the social fabric of our city. It will break down barriers and stereotypes, promoting understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among students from different walks of life. The new high school will become a melting pot of cultures, traditions, and ideas, where students can share their experiences, learn from one another, and develop a deeper appreciation for the diversity that makes our city thrive.Furthermore, the new high school will provide a platform for students to engage in extracurricular activities, sports, and community service, further solidifying the bonds between students from different districts. As a result, our city will become a more harmonious and cohesive community, where students from all backgrounds can come together, learn from each other, and grow into active and responsible citizens. The new high school is not just a building, but a catalyst for positive change, and a beacon of hope for a brighter, more united future.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money.

123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people's lives in two main areas. Firstly, children are free to do whatever they want, with minimal restrictions and rare limitations. This freedom allows them to explore and experience the world around them without the burden of responsibilities. They can play, imagine, and create without worrying about the consequences, which brings them immense joy and happiness. Whether it's playing with friends, building sandcastles, or simply running around in the park, children are able to enjoy life's simple pleasures without a care in the world.In addition, during this stage of their life, children are not burdened with the pressures of education and work. They do not have to worry about meeting deadlines, completing assignments, or dealing with the stress of a 9-to-5 job. As a result, they have a lot of time on their hands to enjoy this stage of their life, unhindered by the demands of adulthood. They can spend their days playing, learning, and growing at their own pace, without the weight of responsibility holding them back. This freedom from obligation allows children to live in the moment, to appreciate the small things, and to find happiness in the everyday experiences that life has to offer. Overall, the combination of freedom and a lack of responsibility makes childhood a truly special and happy time, one that is often looked back upon with nostalgia and fondness.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;The university is often regarded as an ideal place for individuals to develop their understanding of the world and prepare for their future careers. It is here that students are not only imparted with theoretical knowledge, but also provided with opportunities to apply this knowledge in practical settings. Preparing for a career is an essential function of a university, as it equips students with the necessary skills, expertise, and experience required to succeed in their chosen profession.However, the university experience extends far beyond the confines of the classroom. Students are expected to do more than just complete homework, assignments, and attend classes. They are also encouraged to participate in volunteer work and internships, which provide them with valuable hands-on experience and exposure to real-world scenarios. Volunteer work, for instance, helps students develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, while also fostering a sense of social responsibility and empathy.Internships, on the other hand, offer students the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, and gain industry-specific knowledge and skills. By participating in these activities, students can gain a competitive edge in the job market, build a network of professional contacts, and develop a deeper understanding of their chosen field. Furthermore, these experiences help students to develop important soft skills such as time management, adaptability, and leadership, which are essential for success in any career.In conclusion, the university is a vibrant and dynamic environment that offers students a wide range of opportunities to develop their understanding, prepare for their careers, and gain valuable life experiences. By combining academic study with volunteer work and internships, students can acquire the knowledge, skills, and expertise required to succeed in their chosen profession, and make a positive impact in their communities. Ultimately, the university experience is designed to empower students with the skills, confidence, and knowledge necessary to achieve their full potential and make a meaningful contribution to society.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The idea that having a large number of casual acquaintances is beneficial has been a topic of discussion. However, I do not feel the need to emphasize the advantages of having a multitude of casual relationships. Instead, I firmly believe that having one or two close friends is far more valuable than having a large network of casual acquaintances.A friend is someone you genuinely care about, someone with whom you share a deep and meaningful connection. Close friends provide emotional support, comfort, and a sense of belonging. They are the ones who will be there for you through thick and thin, offering a listening ear and a helping hand. In contrast, casual acquaintances may be able to provide a fleeting sense of social connection, but they often lack the depth and intimacy that true friendships offer.Having a small circle of close friends allows for more meaningful and substantial relationships. With fewer, but more significant, connections, you can nurture and invest in those relationships, fostering trust, loyalty, and mutual understanding. This, in turn, leads to a stronger sense of identity and a more profound feeling of being understood and accepted.In conclusion, while having a large number of casual acquaintances may have its benefits, I firmly believe that having one or two close friends is far more rewarding. The intimacy, trust, and emotional support that close friendships provide are essential to our emotional and mental well-being. Therefore, I believe that it is better to prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to relationships, and to cultivate a small, but meaningful, circle of close friends.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";The life we live today is vastly different from what it was half a century ago. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several compelling reasons. Firstly, life was simpler in the past. Without the complexities and distractions of modern technology, people had more time to focus on meaningful relationships, personal growth, and community building. The simplicity of life allowed individuals to appreciate the small joys and find contentment in everyday moments. In contrast, today's fast-paced and materialistic world often leaves people feeling stressed, anxious, and unfulfilled.Secondly, the environment today is seriously damaged. The old days were characterized by pristine natural surroundings, clean air, and pure water. People lived in harmony with nature, and the beauty of the environment was a constant source of inspiration and happiness. Unfortunately, the rapid industrialization and urbanization of the past few decades have taken a devastating toll on the planet, leading to pollution, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. This environmental degradation has significant implications for human well-being and happiness.Lastly, the pace of life is another significant factor. In the past, life moved at a slower and more relaxed pace, allowing people to savor each moment and appreciate the beauty of life. Today, the rapid pace of modern life leaves many people feeling rushed, overwhelmed, and exhausted. The constant pressure to keep up with the demands of work, social media, and other obligations can be overwhelming, leading to increased stress levels and decreased overall happiness. In conclusion, while modern life has its advantages, the simplicity, environmental purity, and relaxed pace of life in the old days are essential factors that contribute to a happier and more fulfilling existence.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High school is a pivotal stage in a student's life, marking the transition from adolescence to adulthood. It is during this period that students are expected to decide on their future career paths and the specific fields they wish to concentrate on. In my opinion, high school should permit students to choose courses they want, and this freedom of choice is essential for several reasons.Firstly, allowing students to choose their courses gives them the freedom to explore their interests and passions. When students are given the autonomy to select courses that align with their aspirations, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their learning. This, in turn, leads to progress in their grades and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. By permitting students to choose courses that resonate with them, they are able to develop a sense of purpose and direction, which is crucial for their future academic and professional pursuits.Moreover, permitting students to choose courses helps them explore their aptitude and strengths. By trying out different courses, students can discover their talents and areas where they excel. This self-discovery process is vital in helping students identify their career aspirations and make informed decisions about their future. Furthermore, when students are able to choose courses that they are interested in, they are more likely to develop a love for learning, which can have a lasting impact on their academic and professional lives.In conclusion, allowing students to choose courses in high school is essential for their academic, personal, and professional growth. By providing students with the freedom to select courses that align with their interests and passions, high schools can help students develop a sense of purpose, explore their aptitude, and make progress in their grades and knowledge. Ultimately, this can have a profound impact on their future career choices and overall success.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The age-old debate about the optimal pace of completing tasks has sparked intense discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people tend to hurry to complete their tasks,On the other hand, others seem to prefer a more relaxed approach. After deeply pondering over this issue, I have developed my own perspective on the matter. In my opinion, being diligent and expeditious in completing tasks is the most beneficial approach.The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing other important tasks. By hurrying to complete tasks, we can free up more time to focus on other pressing responsibilities, thereby increasing our overall productivity. In today's fast-paced world, it is essential to prioritize tasks and manage our time wisely to stay ahead of the curve. Rushing to complete tasks allows us to do just that,Another equally important aspect is that keeping a high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. When we work at a leisurely pace, it is easy to get complacent and procrastinate, leading to a decline in motivation and productivity. On the other hand, maintaining a rapid pace keeps me engaged, motivated, and focused, enabling me to deliver high-quality work while avoiding the pitfalls of laziness. Furthermore, working at a fast pace helps build discipline, resilience, and time-management skills, all of which are valuable assets in both personal and professional life. In conclusion, after careful consideration, I firmly believe that hurrying to complete tasks is the better approach. Not only does it enable us to save time for other important tasks, but it also prevents laziness, builds discipline, and increases productivity. By adopting this approach, we can achieve more in less time, leading to greater success and fulfillment in our lives.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry has become a vital component of economic development in many states and regions around the world. By attracting visitors from diverse backgrounds, tourism can vastly boost economic development, generating significant revenue and stimulating local economies. One of the primary benefits of tourism is its ability to create both direct and indirect job opportunities for the community. This includes employment in retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and the service industry, among others. As a result, tourism plays a crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of local residents and contributing to the overall economic growth of the area.However, not everyone views tourism as a positive force. Some people oppose the development of tourism in their region, citing the potential environmental and cultural destruction it can cause. The influx of tourists can lead to pollution, erosion of natural habitats, and strain on local resources. Additionally, the cultural heritage of a region can be compromised as traditional ways of life are disrupted by the influence of tourism. For instance, the construction of hotels and resorts can lead to the destruction of historic sites and the loss of cultural landmarks.Despite these concerns, it is possible for tourism to be developed in a sustainable and responsible manner. By implementing measures to minimize the environmental impact and preserve cultural heritage, tourism can be a powerful tool for economic development. This can include initiatives such as eco-tourism, which promotes the conservation of natural environments, and cultural tourism, which celebrates and preserves the unique traditions and customs of a region. Ultimately, when managed effectively, tourism has the potential to bring significant economic benefits while also protecting the environment and cultural identity of a region. By striking a balance between economic development and environmental and cultural preservation, tourism can be a valuable asset for states and regions seeking to boost their economic growth.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in society has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is a waste of national resources, which could be better spent on essential public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. They contend that the arts are a luxury that societies can ill afford, especially during times of economic hardship. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.On the other hand, I contend that investment in the field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society. The arts play a vital role in promoting cultural diversity, preserving national heritage, and fostering creativity and innovation. They also have a significant impact on the economy, generating revenue and creating jobs. Furthermore, the arts have the power to bring people together, promote social cohesion, and provide a platform for self-expression and social commentary. By investing in the arts, governments can enrich the lives of their citizens, promote national identity, and contribute to the development of a more enlightened and empathetic society.Moreover, the arts have been proven to have numerous benefits, including improving mental health, boosting tourism, and enhancing urban regeneration. They also provide a means of preserving history, promoting cultural exchange, and showcasing national talent. In conclusion, while some may view the allocation of governmental funds to the arts as a frivolous expense, I firmly believe that it is a wise and forward-thinking investment in the well-being and prosperity of a society. By supporting the arts, governments can reap numerous social, economic, and cultural benefits that will have a lasting impact on the lives of their citizens.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The modern workforce has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. Unlike previous generations, who were content with a single, full-time job and a steady income, new generations are adopting a more dynamic approach to their careers. They are increasingly interested in pursuing multiple jobs and acquiring several higher educational certificates. This shift is largely driven by the desire to earn more and achieve financial security.In the past, a full-time job with a steady income was sufficient for a potential employee to support themselves and their family. However, the recent recession has led to a significant economic downfall in almost all countries worldwide. This has resulted in a loss of job security, reduced income, and increased uncertainty about the future. As a consequence, individuals are now seeking alternative ways to ensure their financial stability.The new generation's preference for multiple jobs and educational certificates is a response to this changing economic landscape. By diversifying their income streams and skill sets, they can better navigate the uncertainties of the modern job market. Moreover, having multiple higher educational certificates enhances their employability and opens up more career opportunities, allowing them to earn a higher income and achieve greater financial security.In conclusion, the traditional notion of a single, full-time job being enough to support oneself and one's family is no longer viable. The new generation's approach to career development, which involves pursuing multiple jobs and educational certificates, is a pragmatic response to the economic realities of the 21st century. As the global economy continues to evolve, it is likely that this trend will persist, with individuals seeking to future-proof their careers and financial stability in an increasingly uncertain world.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The advent of computers has revolutionized the way people interact and live their daily lives. While many argue that computers create more obstacles than help in social life, I strongly disagree with this notion. In my opinion, computers have a profound influence on society and have already become an integral part of people's lives.On one hand, computers have made it possible for people to connect with each other across geographical boundaries. Social media platforms, online forums, and messaging apps have enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family, regardless of their physical location. This has helped to foster global communication and has bridged the gap between people from different cultures and backgrounds.On the other hand, computers have also become an essential tool for daily life. From online shopping to mobile banking, people rely heavily on devices to manage their daily affairs. Computers have also enabled people to access a vast array of information, educational resources, and entertainment options, making them an indispensable part of modern life.Moreover, computers have also transformed the way people work and learn. Remote work opportunities, as well as online courses and tutorials, have made it possible for people to acquire new skills and pursue career advancement from the comfort of their own homes. This has not only increased productivity but also provided people with the flexibility to balance their work and personal life.In conclusion, computers have already become an integral part of people's lives, and their influence on society is undeniable. Rather than being an obstacle, computers have opened up new avenues for communication, education, and personal growth. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that computers will play an even more significant role in shaping our lives and society as a whole.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The traditional approach to employee selection has long emphasized the importance of qualifications. However, a growing number of employers are now seeking criteria beyond academic credentials, such as social skills, in their hiring process. This shift in approach has sparked a debate among employers, with some still believing that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion.On one hand, those who advocate for qualifications as the primary selection criterion argue that they provide a clear indication of a candidate's expertise and knowledge in a specific field. They believe that a degree or certification is a tangible measure of a candidate's ability to perform a job. Moreover, qualifications are often seen as a guarantee of a certain level of competence, which is essential for complex and specialized roles.On the other hand, employers who prioritize social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, argue that these skills are essential for success in today's fast-paced and collaborative work environment. They believe that social skills enable employees to work effectively with others, to adapt to new situations, and to provide excellent customer service. Furthermore, social skills can be developed and refined over time, whereas qualifications are often fixed.In my opinion, while qualifications are important, they should not be the sole criterion for employee selection. Social skills are equally, if not more, important in determining a candidate's potential for success. Employers should strike a balance between the two, considering both the candidate's academic credentials and their social skills. By doing so, employers can ensure that they hire not only knowledgeable but also collaborative, adaptable, and customer-focused employees who can thrive in today's dynamic work environment. Ultimately, a holistic approach to employee selection will lead to a more effective and productive workforce.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The provision of international aid is a crucial aspect of global responsibility. It is essential to acknowledge that people from other countries may be facing far more severe problems than we can imagine. For instance, in some African countries, a significant number of individuals are living below the basic standards of living, struggling to access fundamental necessities like food, water, and shelter. These circumstances highlight the dire need for international aid to alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for these vulnerable populations.The importance of extending a helping hand beyond our national borders cannot be overstated. International aid serves as a lifeline, providing essential support to those who are in dire need. It encompasses a wide range of assistance, including humanitarian aid, economic support, and development programs. By contributing to international aid efforts, we not only demonstrate our commitment to global welfare but also play a role in stabilizing and developing regions that are plagued by poverty, conflict, and natural disasters.Despite the significance of international aid, it is equally reasonable and important to prioritize lending a hand to our fellow citizens. Domestic issues and challenges within our own country should not be overlooked in the pursuit of helping others abroad. In fact, ensuring the well-being and stability of our own nation is foundational to being in a position to offer meaningful assistance globally. By addressing internal issues and supporting our own communities, we strengthen our capacity to contribute positively to the global community. Therefore, striking a balance between providing international aid and supporting domestic needs is essential. This balanced approach allows us to be responsible global citizens while also ensuring the stability and prosperity of our own nation. Through this dual commitment, we can work towards a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations. This significant shift can be attributed to the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology, which has been instrumental in this change. Gone are the days of relying solely on textbooks and traditional teaching methods. With the advent of the internet, laptops, and mobile devices, students now have a plethora of information at their fingertips.The internet has opened up a vast array of alternative sources of knowledge, allowing children to explore and learn at their own pace. Online educational resources, such as interactive websites, educational apps, and video tutorials, provide a dynamic and engaging learning experience. Furthermore, social media platforms and online forums enable students to connect with peers and educators from around the world, facilitating global learning and collaboration.However, while alternative sources are invaluable, traditional teaching methods from educators remain equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge. Teachers provide guidance, support, and mentorship, helping students to navigate and make sense of the vast amount of information available to them. They also offer critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for students to effectively evaluate and apply the knowledge they acquire.In conclusion, the way children study today is a blend of traditional and modern methods. The increased availability of modern technology has revolutionized the learning process, providing students with a wealth of information and resources. Nevertheless, the role of educators remains vital, as they provide the necessary guidance and support to help students effectively acquire and apply knowledge. By striking a balance between alternative sources and traditional teaching methods, children can maximize their learning potential and thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. Ultimately, this hybrid approach to learning will equip children with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the 21st century.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";The world of sports has long been a universal language, understood and celebrated by almost every country around the globe. Major sportive competition events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, have become a staple of modern entertainment, drawing in massive audiences from diverse cultural backgrounds. These events provide a unique social stimulus, fostering a sense of community and togetherness among people from all walks of life. As fans gather to watch their favorite teams and athletes compete, social bonds are formed, and national pride is ignited.Proponents of these events argue that they play a vital role in bridging international divides and promoting global understanding. By bringing people together through a shared passion for sports, these events can help to release tensions and foster diplomacy between nations. The Olympic Games, for example, have a long history of promoting peace and unity among participating countries, with the Olympic truce being a prime example of this effort.On the other hand, critics argue that these events are merely a form of entertainment, designed to distract people from the pressing issues of the day. They contend that the spectacle and excitement of sports competitions serve as a diversion, drawing attention away from pressing global problems such as poverty, inequality, and conflict. According to this view, the frenzy surrounding major sporting events is a fleeting indulgence, offering temporary escapism rather than any meaningful solution to the world's complexities.Despite these differing perspectives, it is undeniable that major sportive competition events continue to captivate audiences worldwide, inspiring a sense of shared experience and communal joy. Whether seen as a force for international harmony or a mere entertainment spectacle, these events undoubtedly possess the power to unite people across borders and cultures, if only for a brief, shining moment.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way students access education. With just an internet connection, students can now cut down on various expenses associated with traditional learning methods. Commuting time, which can be a significant drain on a student's schedule, is greatly reduced, allowing for more time to focus on studies. Additionally, tuition fees and textbook fees are also lowered, as online resources and digital textbooks become more prevalent.Moreover, long-distance education provides students with the opportunity to access a vast array of knowledge resources that may not be available in traditional classroom settings. The internet offers a wealth of information, and online libraries and databases provide students with a vast repository of academic materials. This enables students to explore topics in greater depth and breadth, thereby enhancing their learning experience.Furthermore, distance-learning programs offer a variety of teaching approaches, catering to different learning styles and preferences. Students can choose from a range of courses and programs, tailored to their needs and interests. This flexibility allows students to learn at their own pace, and engage with course materials in a way that suits them best. The incorporation of multimedia resources, such as videos, podcasts, and interactive simulations, also enhances the learning experience, making it more engaging and effective.In conclusion, distance-learning programs offer a cost-effective and flexible way for students to access quality education. By reducing commuting time, tuition fees, and textbook fees, students can focus on their studies without the burden of excessive expenses. The vast knowledge resources and varied teaching approaches available online further enrich the learning experience, making distance-learning programs an attractive option for students worldwide. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that distance-learning programs will become an increasingly popular choice for students seeking to pursue their educational goals.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The debate surrounding animal protection has sparked intense discussions among conservationists and scientists. Animal protectionists often argue that preserving biodiversity is crucial to maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems. They contend that the loss of species can have far-reaching and devastating consequences, such as disrupting food chains, disrupting nutrient cycles, and compromising the overall health of ecosystems. This argument is rooted in the understanding that biodiversity is essential for the resilience and adaptability of ecosystems, enabling them to withstand and recover from environmental stressors and disturbances.However, proponents of the theory of evolution counter that extinction is an inherent and natural process that has shaped the history of life on Earth. According to this perspective, species have always gone extinct as a result of competition, evolutionary changes, and environmental transformations. The Earth's environment has undergone numerous transformations since the emergence of the first species, with periods of rapid change and stability. This constant flux has led to the extinction of countless species, a process that is seen as an inevitable aspect of the evolutionary cycle.Despite this natural cycle of extinction, many argue that human activities have accelerated the rate of species loss to unprecedented levels, threatening the very foundations of ecosystems. The current rate of extinction is estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than the natural rate, primarily due to human-induced habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. Therefore, while extinction may be a natural process, the alarming rate at which it is occurring today warrants urgent attention and action to protect and preserve biodiversity. By acknowledging the essential role of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem balance and the unnatural pace of current extinctions, we can work towards mitigating the impact of human activities on the natural world and preserving the rich tapestry of life on Earth.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. It is the key to unlocking opportunities, fostering personal growth, and shaping the minds of tomorrow. As such, it is imperative that education is accessible and equitable for all, regardless of gender. In my personal opinion, there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university course.The reasons for this stance are multifaceted. Firstly, a gender-neutral admission policy promotes equality and fairness, allowing students to compete on a level playing field. It enables universities to select the most deserving candidates, based on their academic merit, skills, and potential, rather than their gender. This, in turn, leads to a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, where students from different backgrounds and perspectives can come together to share ideas and learn from one another.Furthermore, partiality in terms of gender can have far-reaching consequences, perpetuating stereotypes and limiting the opportunities available to students. For instance, if a particular course is dominated by one gender, it can create a sense of intimidation or discomfort for students of the other gender, hindering their ability to fully participate and engage with the course material. By eliminating gender-based partiality, universities can create a more supportive and empowering environment, where all students feel valued, motivated, and equipped to succeed.In conclusion, education is a fundamental right, and it is essential that it is accessible and equitable for all. By eliminating partiality in terms of gender, universities can promote equality, diversity, and inclusivity, ultimately shaping a brighter, more enlightened future for generations to come.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The significant increase in life expectancy over the past few decades can be largely attributed to the advancements in medical care. Advanced medical care has played a pivotal role in improving the quality of life and increasing the average lifespan of individuals. One of the primary advantages of high-tech medical care is that it enables people to receive better care, leading to improved health outcomes.With access to cutting-edge medical facilities and treatments, people are now able to manage chronic conditions more effectively, and recover from illnesses and injuries at a faster rate. This, in turn, has led to a significant increase in the number of healthy elderly individuals in communities. A community with a large number of healthy elderly members has a major role to play in the sustainable development of a society. Healthy elderly individuals are able to continue contributing to their communities, sharing their knowledge, experience, and wisdom with younger generations.Moreover, healthy elderly individuals are also able to maintain their independence, reducing the burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. This has a positive impact on the overall economy and social fabric of the community. Furthermore, a community with a high number of healthy elderly individuals is more likely to have a strong sense of social cohesion and community engagement, which are essential for sustainable development. In conclusion, advanced medical care has been instrumental in improving life expectancy, and a community with healthy elderly individuals has a vital role to play in promoting sustainable development and building a stronger, more resilient society. By prioritizing access to high-quality medical care, we can continue to promote healthy aging and build a brighter future for generations to come.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The purpose of education has long been a topic of debate among individuals and society as a whole. While some argue that education should be accessible to all, regardless of their intellectual abilities, I firmly believe that it would be more beneficial to reserve this type of training for a select group of exceptional learners. By focusing solely on talented students, academic institutions can maintain their high standards of education quality.In my opinion, concentrating on gifted students is a more effective approach as it enables universities to produce better-equipped individuals for complex and sophisticated purposes. By accepting only top-notch students, the quality of education is likely to improve, resulting in more competent and skilled graduates. This, in turn, will provide society with a talented pool of human resources, capable of tackling intricate challenges and driving progress in various fields.Furthermore, accepting only good students allows universities to tailor their programs to meet the needs of high-achieving individuals, fostering an environment that encourages innovation, critical thinking, and intellectual growth. This selective approach also enables institutions to allocate their resources more efficiently, ensuring that the most capable students receive the support and guidance they need to excel.In conclusion, while the idea of inclusive education may seem appealing, I believe that reserving higher education for talented students is a more practical and effective strategy. By doing so, academic institutions can uphold their high standards, produce exceptional graduates, and ultimately provide society with a skilled and talented workforce. This approach may seem elitist, but it is essential for driving progress and meeting the complex demands of the modern world.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate about how schools can best support their students' education has sparked a longstanding discussion. Some people argue that schools should prioritize investing in famous teachers, as they believe that renowned educators can provide students with a more engaging and effective learning experience. On the other hand, others contend that renewing facilities is the key to creating a conducive learning environment. After weighing the pros and cons of both options, I firmly believe that improving facilities is the best way forward for schools.Improving facilities offers a multitude of benefits that can enhance the overall learning experience. For instance, modern classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art technology can facilitate interactive and immersive lessons, making complex concepts more accessible and enjoyable for students. Moreover, well-maintained sports facilities and equipment can promote physical education and teamwork,. Furthermore, libraries with extensive resources and comfortable study areas can foster a love for reading and provide students with a quiet and focused space to study. In contrast, while famous teachers can undoubtedly bring prestige and expertise to a school, their impact may be limited to the specific subjects they teach, and their presence may not necessarily trickle down to other areas of the school.In conclusion, while having famous teachers can be beneficial, I believe that improving facilities is the more effective way to support students' education. By investing in modern and well-equipped facilities, schools can create an environment that caters to the diverse needs and interests of all students, ultimately leading to a more engaging, effective, and enjoyable learning experience. As such, schools should prioritize renewing their facilities to provide students with the best possible opportunities to thrive and succeed.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;As students navigate their academic journey, it is essential for them to explore and discover their true passions and interests. Rather than prematurely deciding on a future major, they should be encouraged to try a broad range of subjects. This approach allows students to gain a deeper understanding of various fields of study, enabling them to make informed decisions about their academic and professional paths.Tertiary education plays a pivotal role in preparing students for specialization at university. It provides a foundation for students to explore different disciplines, from humanities to sciences, and everything in between. By exposing students to a wide range of subjects, tertiary education fosters a culture of curiosity and experimentation, allowing them to identify areas that genuinely captivate and motivate them.Moreover, trying a broad range of subjects helps students develop a more nuanced understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and interests. It also enables them to recognize the interdisciplinary connections that exist between various fields of study. By doing so, students can make more informed decisions about their future majors, setting themselves up for success and fulfillment in their chosen careers.Ultimately, the goal of tertiary education is to empower students with the knowledge, skills, and passion to pursue their interests with purpose and dedication. By encouraging students to explore a broad range of subjects, we can help them unlock their full potential, leading to a more engaged, motivated, and successful academic and professional journey. In conclusion, students should be given the freedom to discover their interests and passions through a diverse range of subjects, ultimately preparing them for specialization at university and beyond.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;The notion that adults need to play games just as children do has been a topic of discussion in recent years. While some people believe that playing games is essential for adults, I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, games are no longer as important for adults as they are for children, and there are several reasons to support this argument.One of the primary reasons is the pressure of work and family commitments. As individuals grow older, they take on more responsibilities, such as careers and family obligations, which demand a significant amount of time and energy. These commitments force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, including playing games, in order to prioritize their duties. Adults have to manage their time wisely, and unfortunately, playing games often takes a backseat to more pressing responsibilities.Furthermore, adults have different needs and priorities compared to children. While games can be a source of entertainment and relaxation, they are not as crucial for adults as they are for children. Children need games to develop their cognitive and motor skills, as well as to learn social skills and emotional intelligence. Adults, on the other hand, have already developed these skills and can find other ways to relax and unwind, such as reading, exercise, or spending time with loved ones.In conclusion, while playing games can be a fun and entertaining activity for adults, it is not as essential for them as it is for children. The pressure of work and family commitments, combined with the different needs and priorities of adults, make games a secondary activity that can be sacrificed when necessary. As adults, we must prioritize our responsibilities and focus on what is truly important, leaving games as a occasional hobby rather than a necessity.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";The advent of new technology has profoundly impacted cultures around the world, leading to a significant convergence of cultural practices. One of the most striking effects of this phenomenon is the emergence of similarities among diverse cultures. A case in point is the use of software in educational settings. Students in Iran, for instance, utilize the same Microsoft software to complete their homework or deliver presentations as their counterparts in Canada. This homogenization of technological tools has contributed to the creation of a single, modern culture.The proliferation of modern technology has bridged geographical and cultural divides, enabling people from different parts of the world to access and utilize the same digital platforms. Social media, online educational resources, and software applications have become ubiquitous, transcending national and cultural boundaries. As a result, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds are now sharing similar experiences, interacting with the same digital tools, and adopting comparable habits. This shared technological landscape is fostering a sense of global unity and shared modernity.The creation of a single modern culture is further facilitated by the internet, which has made it possible for people to access and engage with cultural content from around the world. This cross-cultural exchange has led to the adoption of similar cultural practices, values, and norms. Furthermore, the widespread use of English as a lingua franca on the internet has simplified communication across cultural boundaries, accelerating the process of cultural homogenization. In conclusion, the impact of new technology on cultures worldwide is undeniable, and the emergence of a single modern culture is an inevitable consequence of this technological revolution. As technology continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to observe how cultures adapt and intersect, ultimately giving rise to a more interconnected and homogeneous global community.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The role of family in achieving success has been a topic of discussion in recent years. Some people believe that nowadays, the assistance from family is quite an essential factor in one's success. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursue success. There are a couple of reasons that support this viewpoint.Firstly, family provides emotional support, which is crucial for overcoming obstacles and staying motivated. When an individual has a supportive family behind them, they are more likely to take risks and push through challenges, knowing that they have a safety net to fall back on. This emotional support can give them the confidence to pursue their goals and dreams, even in the face of adversity. Moreover, a supportive family can also offer valuable guidance and advice, helping individuals to make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes.Secondly, family can also provide financial support, which is often essential for pursuing educational and career opportunities. Many successful individuals have had the benefit of family financial support, whether it be paying for education, internships, or startup costs. This financial support can give individuals the freedom to focus on their goals, without being burdened by financial stress. Furthermore, family connections and networks can also open doors to new opportunities, providing individuals with valuable contacts and references that can help them to get ahead in their chosen field.In conclusion, the assistance from family is indeed a crucial factor in achieving success. The emotional and financial support that family provides can make all the difference in helping individuals to pursue their goals and overcome obstacles. As such, it is essential to recognize the importance of family in achieving success and to nurture and appreciate the support that they provide.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";The age-old debate about the merits of reading fiction versus watching movies has sparked intense discussion among book lovers and film enthusiasts. In my opinion, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for several compelling reasons. Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the intricacies of the plot, characters, and settings. Unlike movies, which often gloss over minor details due to time constraints, novels provide a richer and more nuanced experience. Every description, dialogue, and subplot contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the story, making the reading experience more engaging and satisfying.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient than watching a movie. Many novels are compact, with some spanning only around 100 pages. This brevity enables readers to easily fit in a reading session, even with a tight schedule. In contrast, watching a movie requires a significant time commitment, typically ranging from 1.5 to 3 hours. This can be daunting, especially for individuals with hectic schedules. For instance, I often find myself with only 15 minutes of free time before I need to focus on my studies. In such cases, reading a few pages of a novel is a more feasible and enjoyable option than attempting to watch a movie.Furthermore, the flexibility of reading allows individuals to pick up where they left off without feeling lost or disconnected from the story. This convenience, combined with the attention to detail, makes reading fiction a more enjoyable and accessible experience than watching movies. Ultimately, the unique advantages of reading fiction make it a more appealing and rewarding hobby for those who value depth, convenience, and flexibility in their leisure activities.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The notion of a single language being used throughout the world has sparked a heated debate among linguists, as some people argue that it is a positive change that is contributing to making the world a better place to live. Proponents of this idea suggest that a universal language would greatly simplify daily activities for travelers, such as ordering food in a restaurant or navigating unfamiliar places. Without the barrier of language, individuals would be able to communicate more effectively, thereby reducing misunderstandings and errors.Imagine being able to travel to any country without the hassle of language barriers. A single language would enable people to interact freely, without the need for translators or phrasebooks. This would not only enhance the travel experience but also facilitate international business and diplomacy. Furthermore, a universal language would promote cultural exchange and understanding, as people from diverse backgrounds could communicate and share ideas effortlessly.Moreover, a single language would also reduce misunderstandings between people from different cultures. Miscommunication can often lead to conflicts and misunderstandings, which can be avoided with a common language. This, in turn, would foster global unity and cooperation, as people would be able to work together more effectively towards common goals. However, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks of a single language, such as the loss of cultural diversity and linguistic heritage. Nevertheless, the benefits of a universal language are undeniable, and it is an idea that warrants further exploration and discussion. Ultimately, a single language has the potential to bring people together and make the world a more harmonious and interconnected place.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;We live in an era where technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, transforming the world into a more convenient and interconnected place. One of the most significant beneficiaries of this rapid progress has been the field of medical science. Over the last decade, the phenomenal advancements in medical science have been a huge achievement for humanity, contributing significantly to making the world a healthier and, subsequently, a happier place to live in.The pace at which medical technology is evolving is staggering. Innovations such as advanced diagnostics, personalized medicine, and robotic surgeries have revolutionized healthcare, enabling more precise, efficient, and effective treatments. Furthermore, the development of vaccines and treatments for previously incurable diseases has been a cornerstone of this progress, saving countless lives and improving the quality of life for millions worldwide.The impact of these advancements extends beyond the medical field, contributing to societal and economic improvements. A healthier population is more productive, leading to economic growth and stability. Moreover, the psychological benefit of living in a world where diseases are being eradicated and health issues are being managed more effectively cannot be overstated. The reduction in mortality rates and the increase in life expectancy are testaments to the success of medical science in creating a better world.In conclusion, the progress in medical science over the last decade has been nothing short of remarkable. It stands as a beacon of what can be achieved through human ingenuity, collaboration, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. As technology continues to advance, it is exciting to contemplate what the future holds for medical science and its potential to further enhance the health, happiness, and well-being of humanity. With ongoing investment and innovation, the prospect of a world where health is no longer a concern becomes increasingly plausible, painting a promising picture for the future of our planet.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The topic of teaching financial management to juvenile students has sparked a heated debate among educators and parents. While some argue that introducing money math to children at a young age may have negative consequences, I firmly believe that higher school students should be made aware of the importance of money management. Exposing children to financial literacy at a young age can have numerous benefits. For instance, it can help them develop healthy financial habits, such as saving and budgeting, which can last a lifetime. Moreover, it can also equip them with the necessary skills to make informed decisions about money, thereby avoiding common pitfalls such as debt and financial insecurity. However, some people feel that introducing financial management to children may turn fatal, as it may lead to an overemphasis on material wealth and greed. They argue that children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood without the burden of financial worries. Nevertheless, I disagree with this viewpoint. In today's world, financial literacy is an essential life skill that can benefit individuals of all ages. By teaching financial management to higher school students, we can empower them to take control of their financial futures. It can also help them understand the value of money, the importance of saving, and the consequences of overspending. Furthermore, it can also promote a sense of responsibility and independence, as students learn to manage their own finances. In conclusion, teaching financial management to juvenile students is a vital aspect of their education. It can help them develop essential life skills, avoid financial pitfalls, and make informed decisions about money. As such, I strongly advocate for the inclusion of financial literacy in school curriculums, to equip higher school students with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex world of finance.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;The practice of smoking in restaurants has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that individuals have the right to smoke wherever they please, others contend that smoking in restaurants poses significant health risks to non-smokers. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants as it can make non-smokers breathe uncomfortably and poses health risks to vulnerable individuals.Restaurants are public places where people come to enjoy their meals and pay for the service. It is only fair that these establishments provide a comfortable and healthy environment for all patrons. Smoking in restaurants not only creates an unpleasant atmosphere for non-smokers but also sets a bad example for children, grandparents, and pregnant women who may be present. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke and should be protected from its dangers.Moreover, it is unfair to expose non-smokers, also known as passive smokers, to the same health risks as active smokers. Passive smokers do not have a choice in the matter, yet they are still at risk of developing smoking-related illnesses. By allowing smoking in restaurants, we are essentially forcing non-smokers to inhale toxic fumes against their will. This is a clear infringement on their right to a healthy and safe environment.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants as it creates an uncomfortable environment for non-smokers, sets a bad example for vulnerable individuals, and poses significant health risks to passive smokers. Restaurants have a responsibility to provide a safe and healthy environment for all patrons, and banning smoking is a crucial step in achieving this goal. By doing so, we can protect the health and well-being of non-smokers and promote a healthier and more considerate society.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The depiction of violent behavior in films has become increasingly prevalent over the past 20 years. What's more alarming is that this trend has been exploited as a marketing tool to promote movies. From my perspective, the inclusion of violence in films has detrimental effects on young viewers, particularly in terms of their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.The proliferation of violent content in movies can desensitize youngsters to the consequences of aggressive behavior, leading to a rise in violent outbursts and decreased empathy towards others. Furthermore, exposure to graphic violence can evoke strong emotions, including fear, anxiety, and anger, which can have a lasting impact on a child's emotional well-being. This can lead to difficulties in managing emotions, resulting in impulsivity and poor decision-making.Moreover, the glorification of violence in films can also have a detrimental effect on youngsters' academic performance. Research has shown that exposure to violent media can decrease attention span, reduce motivation, and lead to a decline in overall academic achievement. Youngsters who are repeatedly exposed to violent content may become disengaged from the learning process, as their minds are preoccupied with the aggressive and violent imagery they have been exposed to.It is imperative that filmmakers, producers, and parents take responsibility for the content that youngsters are exposed to. By promoting films that showcase positive role models, empathy, and non-violent conflict resolution, we can help shape the minds of future generations and foster a more compassionate and peaceful society. Ultimately, it is our duty to ensure that the media youngsters consume does not harm their development, but rather contributes to their emotional, social, and academic growth.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"The age-old adage ""information is power"" has been a cornerstone of societal progress for centuries. This phrase suggests that having access to accurate and reliable information is a vital component of making informed decisions, shaping opinions, and navigating the complexities of the world. In today's information-rich environment, the importance of being well-informed cannot be overstated.One of the primary reasons why being well-informed is crucial is that it enables individuals to distinguish between fact and fiction, the latter often masquerading as the former. By consulting different sources of information, we can guarantee the reliability of the data we are consuming. This cross-validation process is essential in a world where misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly, often with detrimental consequences. Whether it's news outlets, academic journals, or governmental reports, utilizing a variety of sources helps to build a comprehensive and accurate picture of any given topic.Moreover, knowing the facts about certain events or problems is indispensable. Relying solely on estimations or hearsay can lead to misunderstandings and misinformed decisions. Facts provide a solid foundation for understanding, allowing individuals to grasp the nuances and complexities of issues. This is particularly important in a world where problems are increasingly complex and multifaceted, requiring thoughtful and informed solutions.In conclusion, the phrase ""information is power"" underscores the significance of being well-informed in today's world. By accessing and verifying information through multiple sources, we not only ensure the accuracy of what we know but also equip ourselves with the power to make informed decisions, contribute meaningfully to discussions, and navigate the world with greater awareness and insight. In an era marked by the rapid dissemination of information, adhering to the principle of verifying information and seeking out facts is more critical than ever."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The preservation of old buildings has long been a contentious issue for governments around the world. On one hand, there is a pressing need to provide adequate housing for citizens, which often leads to the demolition of old structures to make way for new developments. On the other hand, these old buildings hold significant cultural and historical value, and their destruction would result in the loss of a nation's cultural heritage. In my opinion, all old buildings that contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.These buildings are not just mere structures, but are a testament to the country's rich history and cultural identity. They hold memories, stories, and traditions that have been passed down through generations, and their preservation is essential to maintaining a sense of continuity and national pride. Furthermore, preserving old buildings also promotes cultural tourism, which can have significant economic benefits for local communities.While it is true that providing housing for citizens is a pressing concern, it is not necessary to sacrifice cultural heritage for the sake of development. Governments can explore alternative solutions, such as renovating old buildings to make them habitable, or incorporating them into new developments. This way, the cultural significance of the buildings can be preserved, while also addressing the need for housing.In conclusion, the preservation of old buildings is a crucial aspect of maintaining a nation's cultural identity. These buildings are a window into the past, and their destruction would result in the loss of a nation's cultural heritage. Therefore, all old buildings that contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved, and governments should explore innovative solutions to balance the need for development with the need to protect our cultural legacy. By doing so, we can ensure that future generations can continue to appreciate and learn from the rich cultural history of our nation.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The proliferation of mobile phones among young people has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in today's society. Many young individuals consider their mobile phones as the most essential item in their daily lives. However, despite the numerous positive aspects of mobile phones, such as enhanced communication and access to information, I firmly believe that the popularity of mobile phones among the young generation is a detrimental development.Firstly, the constant use of mobile phones is significantly impacting the academic performance of young people. Many students are struggling in school due to the distractions caused by their phones. The constant notifications,ed messages, and social media updates are diverting their attention away from their studies, leading to poor grades and a lack of focus. This distraction is not only affecting their academic achievement but also hindering their ability to develop essential skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.Secondly, the ownership of mobile phones among juveniles is cultivating a materialistic mindset. The latest phone models and accessories have become a status symbol, with many young people feeling pressured to own the most expensive and advanced devices. This obsession with material possessions is shaping their values and priorities, leading to an overemphasis on physical appearances and a lack of appreciation for more meaningful aspects of life. As a result, the younger generation is becoming increasingly consumed by consumerism, neglecting important values such as empathy, kindness, and intellectual curiosity.In conclusion, while mobile phones offer numerous benefits, their popularity among young people is having a profoundly negative impact on their lives. The distractions and materialistic tendencies associated with mobile phone ownership are hindering their academic and personal growth, and it is essential for parents, teachers, and society as a whole to address these issues and promote a healthier relationship with technology among the young generation.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The concept of fixed punishment for each type of crime has been a topic of debate among legal experts and policymakers. On one hand, the implementation of fixed punishment can lead to a significant increase in crime rates, particularly among professional criminals. When the punishment for a specific crime is clearly defined and well-known, it can actually serve as a motivator for seasoned criminals who are aware of the exact consequences of their actions. This predictability can embolden them to continue committing crimes, knowing exactly what they will face if caught.On the other hand, introducing fixed punishment can have several benefits. For instance, it can significantly reduce the time taken by judges to deliver their judgments. With clear guidelines on punishment for each type of crime, judges would not need to spend extensive time deliberating on the appropriate sentence, as it would already be predetermined. This can lead to a more efficient judicial system, where cases are resolved quickly and consistently.Furthermore, fixed punishment can be economically beneficial for the government. By streamlining the judicial process and reducing the time spent on sentencing, the government can allocate resources more effectively. The faster resolution of cases means less expenditure on prolonged legal proceedings, which can then be directed towards other critical areas such as crime prevention programs, rehabilitation services, and law enforcement.In conclusion, while fixed punishment may have its drawbacks, such as potentially increasing crime rates among professional criminals, it also offers significant advantages in terms of judicial efficiency and economic savings. It is crucial for legal systems to weigh these factors carefully and consider a balanced approach that combines the benefits of fixed punishment with measures to deter criminal activity effectively.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air fares has revolutionized the travel industry, making it more accessible to people from all walks of life, particularly those from lower income groups. This has broadened travel possibilities, enabling individuals to explore new destinations, experience different cultures, and connect with others globally. The increased affordability of air travel has also boosted economic growth, as more people are able to travel for business, leisure, and education.However, the proliferation of flights has also raised concerns about the environmental impact of air travel. The increased number of flights has led to the expansion of airports, resulting in busier and more congested facilities. This, in turn, has exacerbated air pollution in surrounding areas, posing health risks to people who live and work nearby. The burning of plane fuel releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the environment, contributing to global warming and climate change. As the Earth's temperature rises, the consequences are far-reaching, from melting glaciers to extreme weather events.The trade-off between affordable air travel and environmental sustainability is a complex issue. While cheap air fares have opened up new opportunities for many, it is essential to consider the long-term effects of increased air travel on the environment. To mitigate these impacts, airports and airlines can invest in more sustainable practices, such as using cleaner fuels, optimizing flight routes, and implementing energy-efficient technologies. Additionally, governments and regulatory bodies can implement policies to reduce emissions and promote eco-friendly aviation practices. Ultimately, striking a balance between accessibility and environmental responsibility is crucial to ensure that the benefits of cheap air fares are not outweighed by the costs to the planet.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;Despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several compelling reasons. On the one hand, if I have always wanted to find a job, a place to live that is not too far from my workplace is a must. The convenience of having my residence in close proximity to my workplace is a significant factor in my preference for city living. This not only saves me time and energy that would be spent on commuting but also allows me to have a better work-life balance.Another reason I prefer big city life is the opportunity to enjoy modern life and have more access to advanced facilities. Big cities are hubs for technological innovation, economic growth, and cultural diversity. They offer a wide range of modern amenities, entertainment options, and services that make life more comfortable and exciting. From state-of-the-art healthcare facilities to world-class educational institutions, and from diverse culinary experiences to vibrant cultural events, big cities have something to offer for everyone.Living in big cities also means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. The fast-paced environment of a big city exposes me to a constant flow of new ideas, trends, and perspectives. This intellectual and cultural stimulation is invaluable for personal growth and development. Moreover, the diversity of a big city's population ensures that I am surrounded by people from various backgrounds, professions, and age groups, providing a rich tapestry of experiences and viewpoints. This diverse and dynamic environment is not only exciting but also enriching, making big city life my clear preference over the quieter, more predictable pace of small town life. Overall, the combination of convenience, modern amenities, and intellectual stimulation makes living in a big city the perfect choice for me.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;Rewarding employees for their outstanding performance is a crucial aspect of any organization's success. Two of the most common methods used to acknowledge and appreciate good work are salary increases and promotions to new positions. These incentives not only motivate employees to continue delivering high-quality work but also serve as a catalyst for others to strive for excellence. Salary increases provide a tangible reward that recognizes an employee's hard work and dedication, while promotions offer new challenges and opportunities for growth, thereby keeping employees engaged and motivated.However, from my perspective, providing professional training stands out as an equally effective, if not more so, method to encourage further good work. Professional training not only enhances an employee's skill set, making them more valuable to the organization, but it also demonstrates a commitment from the employer to the employee's long-term career development. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and a stronger sense of loyalty towards the organization. Moreover, professional training is a forward-thinking approach that prepares employees for future challenges and opportunities, potentially leading to innovation and excellence in their work.Furthermore, professional training can have a multiplier effect, where the skills and knowledge gained by one employee can benefit the entire team or organization. It fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement, which is essential in today's fast-paced and ever-changing business environment. By investing in their employees' professional development, organizations can reap long-term benefits, including improved productivity, better employee retention, and a competitive edge in the market. Therefore, while salary increases and promotions are powerful motivators, providing professional training offers a unique and valuable approach to rewarding good work and encouraging employees to reach new heights of performance and achievement.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The traditional notion of compulsory class attendance in universities has been a long-standing debate among educators and students. However, the question arises, should attending classes be optional for students? In my opinion, the answer is yes. With the abundance of educational resources available outside the classroom, students can learn better and more effectively through self-study.In today's digital age, students have access to a vast array of online materials, including video lectures, podcasts, and e-books. These resources can provide a more engaging and personalized learning experience, allowing students to learn at their own pace and revisit complex concepts as many times as they need. Moreover, students can also utilize the university library, a treasure trove of knowledge, to study and focus on topics they struggle with. The library offers a quiet and conducive environment, free from distractions, where students can delve deeper into their coursework and clarify any doubts they may have.Optional class attendance would also foster a sense of responsibility and autonomy among students. By giving them the freedom to choose how they want to learn, they would be more motivated to take ownership of their education. This, in turn, would lead to better retention of information, as students would be more invested in their learning process. Additionally, optional classes would allow students to prioritize their time more effectively, balancing academic responsibilities with other aspects of university life, such as extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, or research projects.In conclusion, making class attendance optional would be a step forward in acknowledging the diverse learning styles and needs of students. By providing students with the flexibility to learn through alternative means, universities can cater to a broader range of learners, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and effective learning environment.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;As I near the completion of my university studies, I am faced with a significant decision that will impact my future: whether to reside in a small town or a big city. While both options have their advantages, I am inclined to believe that living in a big city is the more appealing choice. One of the primary reasons for this is the abundance of opportunities that cities provide.First and foremost, a big city offers a wider range of job opportunities, particularly in my field of engineering. The likelihood of finding a suitable position is significantly higher in a metropolitan area, where numerous companies and industries are concentrated. This would enable me to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, thereby advancing my career.Furthermore, big city life is renowned for its vibrant and diverse entertainment options. The plethora of bars, cafes, and restaurants available provides an ideal setting for socializing with friends and acquaintances. Whether it's a casual meetup or a special occasion, the city offers something for everyone, making it an exciting and dynamic place to live.Lastly, cities are equipped with better medical facilities and healthcare services compared to smaller towns. This aspect is crucial, as it ensures that residents have access to quality medical care when needed. The presence of specialized hospitals, advanced equipment, and skilled medical professionals in cities provides peace of mind, knowing that help is readily available in case of emergencies.In conclusion, the benefits of living in a big city, including enhanced job prospects, a wide range of entertainment options, and superior medical facilities, make it an attractive choice for me as I embark on my post-university life. The city's fast-paced and diverse environment is where I envision myself thriving, both professionally and personally.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The advent of the computer is one of the most significant outcomes of the development of advanced technology. In my opinion, the emergence of computers has revolutionized our lives, bringing about unparalleled convenience and ease. One of the primary advantages of computers is that they have enabled easier access to information. With just a few clicks, we can now access a vast array of information from anywhere in the world, at any time. This has been particularly beneficial for students, researchers, and professionals, who can now conduct research, gather data, and stay updated on the latest developments in their fields with minimal effort.Furthermore, computers have significantly improved the quality of communication. Email, social media, and messaging apps have made it possible to connect with people across the globe, fostering global interactions and collaborations. This has not only bridged geographical gaps but also enabled people to maintain relationships, conduct business, and share ideas with ease. The increased speed and efficiency of communication have also facilitated faster decision-making, problem-solving, and crisis management.In addition to these benefits, computers have also automated many tasks, freeing up time for more creative and intellectual pursuits. They have enabled us to manage our daily lives more efficiently, from online banking and shopping to entertainment and education. Overall, the computer has been a game-changer, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with each other. As technology continues to evolve, it is exciting to think about the new possibilities and innovations that computers will bring to our lives in the future. In conclusion, the advent of computers has undoubtedly made our lives more convenient, easier, and more interconnected, and their impact will only continue to grow in the years to come.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The notion that working from home brings too much convenience to workers is a common misconception. While it may seem ideal to work from the comfort of one's own home, many people overlook the potential drawbacks that come with it. In reality, the best conditions for productivity and job satisfaction are not always met when working from home.One of the primary disadvantages of working from home is the lack of pressure to perform. Without the structure and accountability of an office environment, many individuals may find themselves struggling with procrastination and decreased motivation. Additionally, working from home can be isolating, leading to a lack of interaction with colleagues and peers. This social isolation can stifle creativity, innovation, and collaboration, all of which are essential components of a successful and engaging work experience.Moreover, the absence of a traditional office setting can blur the lines between work and personal life, making it difficult for individuals to disconnect from their job responsibilities. This can lead to burnout and decreased work-life balance, ultimately negatively impacting overall well-being. While some may argue that working from home provides unparalleled convenience, I firmly believe that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. The lack of pressure, the isolation, and the blurred lines between work and personal life all contribute to a suboptimal work experience.In conclusion, working from home is not the utopian work arrangement that many people make it out to be. The convenience it offers comes with significant costs, including decreased motivation, social isolation, and a lack of work-life balance. As such, I firmly disagree with the notion that working from home brings too much convenience to workers, and instead believe that a traditional office setting, with its inherent structure and social interactions, is often more conducive to productivity and job satisfaction.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of professors in universities is multifaceted, encompassing both research and teaching responsibilities. However, there is an ongoing debate about the balance between these two aspects of their job. In my opinion, professors should prioritize preparing courses for their students over conducting research. This is because the primary function of a university is to educate students, and well-prepared courses are essential for providing a high-quality learning experience.If professors are too busy with research to prepare appropriate courses, it can have severe consequences for the reputation of universities. Students expect to gain knowledge and skills from their professors, and if the courses are not well-structured or relevant, they may feel that they are not receiving the education they deserve. This can lead to dissatisfaction among students, which can ultimately damage the reputation of the university. On the other hand, if professors focus on preparing courses, they can ensure that students receive a valuable education, which can enhance the reputation of the university.Moreover, professors can integrate their research into their teaching, which can benefit both themselves and their students. By involving students in research projects, they can teach them valuable skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. This approach not only prepares students for their future careers but also helps professors to stay updated with the latest developments in their field. Furthermore, it can foster a sense of community and shared purpose among students and professors, which is essential for a positive and productive learning environment.In conclusion, while research is an important aspect of a professor's job, preparing courses for students should be their top priority. By doing so, they can provide high-quality education, enhance the reputation of universities, and even integrate their research into their teaching. This balanced approach can lead to a more effective and enjoyable learning experience for students, and a more fulfilling career for professors.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The development of technology has been a driving force behind economic growth and the improvement of living standards in recent decades. As technology advances, it creates new opportunities for businesses to innovate and expand, leading to increased productivity and job creation. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the overall economy, as it stimulates growth and raises the standard of living for individuals. Moreover, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living level and healthcare standard. With access to better medical facilities and treatments, people are living longer and healthier lives.However, the rapid development of technology also has its downsides. On the other hand, technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. The production and disposal of technological devices contribute to pollution and waste, harming the environment and ecosystems. Furthermore, the over-reliance on technology can lead to social isolation, decreased human interaction, and a loss of traditional skills. Additionally, the exploitation of technology can also lead to job displacement, as automation replaces human workers in certain industries.In conclusion, while the development of technology has numerous benefits, including prompting economic growth and improving living standards, it also poses significant challenges to the environment and society. It is essential to strike a balance between technological advancement and social and environmental responsibility. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of technology are shared by all, while minimizing its negative consequences. Ultimately, the key to harnessing the power of technology lies in its thoughtful and sustainable development, and its application in a way that prioritizes the well-being of both people and the planet.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state has evolved to encompass a broad range of social and economic responsibilities. One of the most critical aspects of this concept is the provision of sustainable healthcare and health education to citizens. Governments have a moral and ethical obligation to ensure that their citizens have access to quality healthcare services and education that promotes healthy living and disease prevention.The importance of healthcare and health education cannot be overstated. A healthy population is the backbone of a productive and prosperous society. When citizens are educated about healthy habits and have access to quality healthcare, they are more likely to lead healthy and productive lives, contributing to the overall well-being of the society. Furthermore, a healthy population reduces the economic burden on the healthcare system, as preventive measures reduce the likelihood of costly medical interventions.However, many governments still allocate a larger proportion of their budget to treatment rather than prevention and education. This approach is not only costly but also inefficient in the long run. Treatment of diseases and health conditions is often more expensive than preventive measures, and it does not address the root causes of health problems. In contrast, education and prevention initiatives can help to reduce the incidence of diseases and health conditions, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. By prioritizing health education and prevention, governments can promote a culture of healthy living, reduce the burden on the healthcare system, and ultimately create a more productive and prosperous society. This approach is not only a moral and ethical imperative but also a sound economic strategy that can have long-term benefits for individuals, communities, and societies as a whole.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;The decision of where to live during university years is a crucial one, with many students torn between living in university dormitories and renting an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, making the choice a challenging one. On one hand, university dormitories offer a sense of community and camaraderie, with students from various backgrounds and disciplines living together. Additionally, dormitories are often conveniently located near academic buildings and other university facilities. However, they can be restrictive in terms of freedom, with rules and regulations governing various aspects of life.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the city provides a higher level of independence and autonomy. Students can come and go as they please, without having to adhere to strict rules and curfews. Furthermore, apartments often provide better studying conditions, with fewer distractions and more privacy, allowing students to focus on their academic pursuits. Economically, while the initial cost of renting an apartment may seem higher, the flexibility and freedom it offers can lead to a more balanced and productive lifestyle, which can be beneficial in the long run.After considering these factors, if I had to choose, I would prefer living in an apartment. The level of freedom and independence it provides is essential for personal growth and development. Moreover, the quieter and more private studying conditions would enable me to focus better on my studies, leading to better academic performance. While the economic factor may seem daunting at first, I believe the benefits of living in an apartment far outweigh the costs. In conclusion, living in an apartment in the city is the preferred choice for students who value their independence, want to create a conducive studying environment, and are willing to manage their finances effectively.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"The film ""Click"" offers a unique blend of comedy and seriousness, tackling the crucial issue of achieving a balance between family life and professional obligations. On the surface,,ity, ""Click"" appears to be a lighthearted comedy, but upon closer inspection, it reveals a profound exploration of the human experience, delving into themes that are typically associated with more serious, dramatic films.Serious movies often grapple with complex, introspective topics such as love, humaneness, and the societal ills that plague our world.

174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;In my point of view, the disadvantages of overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people by the media outweigh its advantages. The media's obsession with celebrity gossip has become a staple of modern entertainment, but it comes with a significant cost. Firstly, the gossip often involves misleading images and sensationalized stories, fabricated for the sole purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. This not only misleads the public but also invades the privacy of the individuals involved, causing them undue stress and harm.Moreover, the excessive focus on celebrity lives distracts the viewers from more pressing public or social problems. By prioritizing gossip and scandals over substantive news, the media fails to inform and educate the public on critical issues that affect their daily lives. This sensationalism creates a culture of voyeurism, where people are more invested in the personal lives of strangers than in the issues that shape their communities and the world at large. As a result, important discussions and debates on topics such as economic policies, environmental issues, and social injustices are overshadowed by trivial matters, leading to a misinformed and apathetic public.Ultimately, the media's overemphasis on celebrity gossip undermines its potential to serve as a force for good, informing and educating the public on matters of real consequence. By shifting the focus away from sensationalized gossip and towards more substantive reporting, the media can play a more constructive role in shaping public discourse and promoting a more informed and engaged citizenry. In conclusion, the negative impacts of the media's fixation on celebrity lives far outweigh any perceived benefits, highlighting the need for a more balanced and responsible approach to reporting.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;As a lover of travel, I firmly believe that visiting an excellent museum is the quintessence of any tour. For me, the best part of exploring a new destination is delving into its rich history and customs, and a museum provides the perfect platform to do so. Primarily, it is easy to gain insight into the history and customs of a new place by visiting a museum. The artifacts, exhibits, and displays showcased in a museum offer a glimpse into the past, allowing visitors to understand the cultural, social, and historical context of the region. By examining these relics, I can develop a deeper appreciation for the local traditions, customs, and way of life, which in turn, enhances my overall travel experience.Secondary to this, visiting a well-known museum can also broaden our horizon. Museums often feature a diverse range of exhibits, showcasing art, science, technology, and innovation from around the world. Exposure to such a wide range of topics and ideas can stimulate my curiosity, challenge my assumptions, and encourage me to think critically. Moreover, museums often host temporary exhibitions, which provide a unique opportunity to learn about specialized topics or discover new artists and movements. By engaging with these exhibits, I can expand my knowledge, gain new perspectives, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world. Ultimately, a visit to an excellent museum is an essential component of any tour, offering a rich and rewarding experience that combines education, entertainment, and inspiration. Whether I am exploring a new city or revisiting a familiar one, a museum is always at the top of my itinerary, promising a memorable and enriching experience.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The advent of technology has made it possible for individuals to study from the comfort of their own homes. With the rise of distance education courses, students can now access a wide range of academic programs without having to physically attend a classroom. While studying at home using technology is undoubtedly convenient, it may not be the most effective way to complete a course. One of the main drawbacks of distance education is the lack of social interaction with teachers and classmates.Unlike traditional schools, where students are surrounded by their peers and instructors, distance education courses often take place in isolation. This can make it difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged in their studies. Moreover, the socialization aspect of traditional schooling is an essential part of the learning experience. Establishing relationships with classmates and developing social skills, such as communication and teamwork, are crucial for personal and professional growth. Computers or televisions, as advanced as they may be, cannot teach us how to get along with people or navigate complex social situations.In contrast, traditional schools provide a unique environment where students can interact with their peers, make friends, and develop important social skills. The presence of teachers and classmates also provides a sense of accountability and motivation, which can be lacking in distance education courses. While technology has made it possible to access educational resources from anywhere, it is essential to recognize the value of traditional schooling in providing a well-rounded education that goes beyond academic knowledge. Ultimately, a combination of both traditional and distance education methods may be the most effective way to ensure that students receive a comprehensive education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The establishment of a large shopping center in our community is a highly anticipated development that promises to bring numerous benefits to residents. One of the most significant advantages of this new shopping center is the convenience it will provide to shoppers. No longer will residents have to travel to distant locations or visit multiple smaller stores to find what they need. Instead, they will be able to find a wide range of products and services under one roof, making their shopping experience more efficient and enjoyable.In addition to the convenience factor, the shopping center is also likely to offer lower prices on goods, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. With a large number of stores and vendors competing for customers, prices are likely to be driven down, making it possible for residents to purchase the items they need at a lower cost. This is especially beneficial for families and individuals on a tight budget, who will be able to stretch their dollars further and make the most of their shopping budget.Another significant benefit of the shopping center is the time-saving aspect. With all the necessary shops and services located in one place, residents will be able to complete their shopping tasks in a shorter amount of time, freeing up more time for leisure and other activities. This is especially important in today's fast-paced world, where time is a precious commodity. By providing a one-stop shopping experience, the shopping center will help residents make the most of their time, allowing them to balance their busy lives more effectively. Overall, the establishment of the large shopping center is a welcome development that will bring convenience, affordability, and time-saving benefits to residents, making it a valuable addition to our community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";Stress is our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, and it can be triggered by both positive and negative experiences. In today's frenetic and fast-paced world, stress has become a ubiquitous and unwelcome companion for people of all ages. From youngsters to seniors, everyone is susceptible to feeling overwhelmed and depressed due to stress.The pressures of modern life, including academic, professional, and social expectations, can be overwhelming. The constant need to perform, achieve, and succeed can take a toll on our mental and physical health. Even positive events, such as weddings, graduations, or job promotions, can be sources of stress due to the associated responsibilities and expectations. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancements and the proliferation of social media have created an environment where people feel compelled to be constantly connected and available, leading to a sense of perpetual stress and anxiety.The consequences of chronic stress can be severe, ranging from mood disturbances and emotional instability to cardiovascular diseases and a weakened immune system. Furthermore, stress can also lead to depression, anxiety disorders, and other mental health issues. It is essential, therefore, to recognize the signs of stress and take proactive steps to manage it. This can include engaging in regular exercise, practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, and seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals.In conclusion, stress is an inevitable aspect of modern life, but it is crucial to acknowledge its effects and take measures to mitigate them. By being aware of the sources of stress and taking steps to manage it, we can reduce the risk of depression and other stress-related disorders, and cultivate a healthier, more balanced lifestyle. It is only by prioritizing our mental and physical well-being that we can navigate the challenges of the fast-paced world and thrive in the face of adversity.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";The importance of groups and organizations in our lives cannot be overstated. They provide a platform for individuals to gain valuable experiences, achieve their goals, and develop essential skills. From a young age, groups play a vital role in the process of socialization, helping children to interact with others, learn important values, and develop emotional intelligence. As individuals grow into adulthood, these groups continue to play a significant role, shaping their personalities, and influencing their worldviews.A solid group can be a suited environment that fosters personal growth and development. It provides a sense of belonging, which is essential for emotional and mental well-being. Being part of a group allows individuals to share ideas, learn from others, and gain new perspectives, broadening their horizons and expanding their knowledge. Moreover, groups offer a platform for individuals to take on new challenges, step out of their comfort zones, and develop resilience.

By being part of a solid group, individuals can broaden their horizons, develop important life skills, and achieve a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The government's plan to build a new university in our community has sparked a mix of excitement and concern among residents. On the one hand, the establishment of a university in our area will undoubtedly bring numerous benefits to the local population. For instance, it will provide more opportunities for people to pursue higher education, which may have been previously inaccessible due to financial or logistical constraints. This, in turn, will lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, contributing to the community's economic growth and development.Moreover, the presence of a university will attract intellectuals, researchers, and experts from various fields, enriching the community's cultural and intellectual landscape. The university will also create new job opportunities, both directly and indirectly, in fields such as education, research, and support services. This will have a positive impact on the local economy, as it will generate new sources of income and stimulate entrepreneurship.However, the setup of a university also comes with its set of drawbacks. One of the primary concerns is the potential for social problems. The influx of students from diverse backgrounds may lead to cultural and social clashes, potentially disrupting the community's harmony. Additionally, the increased population density may put a strain on local resources, such as housing, transportation, and healthcare facilities. There is also the possibility of noise pollution, traffic congestion, and other environmental issues associated with the construction and operation of the university.In conclusion, while the government's plan to build a new university in our community presents several advantages, including increased access to higher education and economic growth, it also raises concerns about social problems and strain on local resources. It is essential for the government and community leaders to engage in thorough planning and consultation to mitigate the negative impacts and ensure that the university becomes a positive and enriching addition to our community.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The debate over who should bear the cost of college tuition has been ongoing for years. Some people argue that the government should cover the tuition and expenses for any citizen who wishes to attend college. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. In my opinion, individuals should be responsible for paying their own college tuition.One of the primary reasons for this is the enormous cost associated with funding college education for all citizens. If the government were to take on this burden, it would likely lead to a significant increase in taxes. This would not only be a financial strain on taxpayers but also create a cycle of continuous tax hikes to sustain the funding of college education. This would be unfair to those who do not attend college or do not have children attending college, as they would still be required to contribute to the cost of education through their taxes.Furthermore, I believe that pursuing a college education is a personal choice. While it is undeniable that higher education can lead to better career opportunities and personal growth, it is still an individual decision. Therefore, it is only fair that individuals who choose to attend college should be responsible for covering the costs associated with it. This would also encourage students to be more mindful of their academic and career goals, as they would be investing their own money in their education.In conclusion, while the idea of free college education may seem appealing, I firmly believe that individuals should pay for their own college tuition. The financial burden on the government and taxpayers would be too great, and it is a personal choice that individuals should be responsible for funding.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";The advent of television has revolutionized the way we live, interact, and perceive the world around us. On one hand, television provides us with numerous benefits that enhance our daily lives. For instance, it helps people relax and unwind after a long day, offering a much-needed escape from the stresses of everyday life. Moreover, television keeps us informed about current events and news from around the globe, making us more aware and knowledgeable about the world we live in. Additionally, television broadens our minds by exposing us to different cultures, lifestyles, and ideas, fostering empathy, understanding, and tolerance.However, despite these benefits, television has a darker side that has significant negative impacts on our social fabric. One of the most concerning effects of television is its potential to destroy communication among friends and family. The increasing amount of time spent watching TV can lead to a decline in meaningful interactions and conversations, replacing quality time with loved ones with solitary screen time. This not only affects relationships but also hampers the development of essential social skills in both children and adults.Furthermore, children are particularly vulnerable to the influences of television. Instead of learning behaviors and values from their parents or guardians, children often mimic what they see on TV. This can lead to the adoption of negative behaviors, attitudes, and values, as television programs may not always portray the most exemplary conduct. The implications of this are profound, as the next generation's moral compass and social norms may be shaped more by what they watch than by the teachings and examples set by their caregivers. In conclusion, while television offers numerous benefits, its potential to erode communication among loved ones and influence children's behavior in undesirable ways cannot be overlooked. It is essential to maintain a balance in television viewing and ensure that it complements, rather than compromises, our personal relationships and societal values.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home.

So, grab your tickets, don your team's colors, and get ready to cheer on your home team with thousands of like-minded fans – the experience will be truly unforgettable.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The world's increasing reliance on energy has led to a growing concern about the depletion of traditional fossil fuels, such as gas, oil, and coal. As a result, renewable resources of energy have become a crucial element of the current and future energy strategy. These new forms of energy, including solar, wind, and hydro power, offer a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, as far as I am concerned, these renewable resources cannot soon replace fossil fuels as the primary source of energy.One of the main reasons for this is the limitation of technology. While significant advancements have been made in the field of renewable energy, the technology is still not advanced enough to make it a viable replacement for fossil fuels. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy sources are still not on par with traditional energy sources. Moreover, the infrastructure required to support widespread adoption of renewable energy is still in its infancy.Another significant obstacle is the relatively high cost of renewable energy. Due to the limitations of technology, renewable resources are still more expensive than traditional fossil fuels. The cost of producing energy from renewable sources, such as solar panels and wind turbines, is still prohibitively expensive for many countries and individuals. Until the cost of renewable energy decreases, it will be difficult for it to compete with the cheaper and more established fossil fuels.In conclusion, while renewable resources of energy are an essential part of our future energy strategy, they are not yet ready to replace fossil fuels as the primary source of energy. The limitations of technology and the relatively high cost of renewable energy make it difficult for them to compete with traditional energy sources. However, as technology continues to advance and the cost of renewable energy decreases, we can expect to see a shift towards more sustainable and cleaner energy sources.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;The debate over the importance of preserving land for endangered animals versus utilizing it for human needs has been ongoing. There is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry take precedence over saving land for endangered species. This perspective is rooted in two primary aspects. Firstly, land allocated for agriculture, the real estate industry, and industrial purposes can benefit the whole society to a greater extent. Farmlands provide food security, ensuring that the population has access to nutritious food, while the real estate industry and industrial sectors contribute significantly to the economy, driving growth and development.Secondly, the expansion of farmlands and industries can lead to an increase in job opportunities, which in turn can decrease the unemployment rate and subsequently, the crime rate. When people have stable employment, they are less likely to engage in criminal activities, leading to safer communities. Moreover, industries and farmlands require a substantial workforce, from manual laborers to skilled professionals, thereby absorbing a significant portion of the workforce. This not only boosts economic activity but also enhances social stability by providing individuals with a means of earning a living and supporting their families.In contrast, while saving land for endangered animals is crucial for biodiversity and ecological balance, the immediate benefits of using land for human needs seem more tangible and pressing. However, it is essential to strike a balance between development and conservation, ensuring that while human needs are met, the natural world is also protected for future generations. Innovative solutions such as sustainable farming practices and eco-friendly industrial developments can help achieve this balance, making it possible to benefit society without completely sacrificing the habitats of endangered species. Ultimately, the decision to prioritize human needs over conservation efforts is complex, requiring careful consideration of both the short-term benefits of development and the long-term consequences of environmental degradation.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The acquisition of a foreign language is a complex and multifaceted process that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the learning environment. Research has shown that individuals who learn a foreign language in the country where it is spoken tend to develop a deeper understanding of various language skills compared to those who learn the same language in their own country. This phenomenon can be attributed to the immersive nature of learning a language in its native context, which provides learners with unparalleled opportunities for authentic interaction and exposure to the language.In contrast, individuals like person 'A', who attempt to learn a non-native language in their home country, may face significant challenges due to the lack of immersion and authentic interaction. However, person 'A' can still reap benefits from language learning through the use of a step-by-step teaching method. This approach involves breaking down the language into its component parts, such as grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, and presenting them in a logical and incremental manner. By mastering each component in a gradual and systematic way, person 'A' can build a strong foundation in the language and develop a range of skills, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.While the step-by-step method can be effective, it is essential to acknowledge that it may not fully replicate the richness and depth of language learning that occurs in the target language country. Nevertheless, with dedication and persistence, person 'A' can still achieve a high level of proficiency and develop a nuanced understanding of the language. Ultimately, the key to successful language learning, regardless of the environment, is a combination of effective teaching methods, consistent practice, and a willingness to engage with the language in a meaningful and interactive way.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The importance of exercise extends far beyond its physical benefits, as it also plays a significant role in maintaining a healthy mind. Engaging in daily physical activity not only helps to develop and maintain a strong and healthy body, but also has a profound impact on our mental well-being. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and even alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, the benefits of exercise are not limited to adults, as daily physical activity has also been proven to enhance brain function in children.Incorporating exercise into a child's daily routine from an early age can have a lasting impact on their cognitive development and academic performance. Research has shown that regular physical activity can improve memory, concentration, and problem-solving skills in children, ultimately leading to better academic outcomes. Moreover, teaching children the value of physical activity from a young age can instill healthy habits that will last a lifetime. By making exercise a priority, children learn the importance of self-care and develop a positive relationship with physical activity, which can help to combat the rising rates of obesity and related health issues.In conclusion, exercise is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle, benefiting not only our physical health but also our mental well-being. By incorporating daily physical activity into our routines, and teaching children the value of exercise from an early age, we can set ourselves and future generations up for a lifetime of health, happiness, and success. As such, it is essential that we prioritize physical activity and make it a cornerstone of our daily routines, for the benefit of both body and mind. By doing so, we can reap the numerous rewards of exercise and cultivate a healthier, happier, and more resilient population.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In my opinion, it is not a good idea for teenagers to have a job while they are still students. Having a job at a young age can interfere with their life in various ways, ultimately affecting their overall well-being and academic performance. One of the primary concerns is the impact on their health. Balancing work and school responsibilities can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, as teenagers may have to sacrifice sleep, exercise, and healthy eating habits to accommodate their work schedule.Furthermore, having a job can divert their mind from studies, making it challenging for them to focus on their academic pursuits. The pressure to perform well in school and meet work expectations can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety. As a result, their grades may suffer, and they may fall behind their peers. Moreover, the demands of a job can also limit their ability to participate in extracurricular activities, sports, and social events, which are essential for their emotional and social development.Perhaps most importantly, having a job can take away their childhood phase from their life. Teenage years are a critical period for exploration, discovery, and play, and having a job can force them to mature too quickly. It can deprive them of the carefree days of youth, when they should be focusing on developing their interests, talents, and relationships. By not having a job, teenagers can enjoy their adolescence, make mistakes, learn from them, and grow into well-rounded individuals without the burden of adult responsibilities. In conclusion, while having a job may provide some benefits, the potential drawbacks outweigh the advantages, and it is not a good idea for teenagers to have a job while they are still students.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The establishment of zoos dates back to ancient times, with these institutions being set up all over the world. Over the years, zoos have evolved to become popular destinations for entertainment and leisure. Many people visit zoos to marvel at the diverse range of animals on display, and to learn about the different species and their habitats. Proponents of zoos argue that they provide a unique platform for education and entertainment, allowing people to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of wildlife.On the one hand, zoos offer a controlled environment where animals can thrive, and where visitors can observe and learn from them. Many zoos also offer interactive exhibits and educational programs, which can inspire people, especially children, to develop a love and respect for nature and wildlife. Moreover, zoos play a crucial role in conservation efforts, providing a safe haven for endangered species and participating in breeding programs to increase population numbers.On the other hand, there are those who vehemently oppose the idea of keeping animals in zoos, viewing it as a form of cruelty and exploitation. They argue that confining animals to small enclosures is inhumane and wrong, as it deprives them of their natural habitats and freedom. These critics also point out that many zoos prioritize entertainment value over animal welfare, and that the conditions in which animals are kept are often substandard. Furthermore, they argue that zoos do little to promote genuine conservation efforts and instead serve as mere spectacles for human amusement.Ultimately, the debate surrounding zoos is complex and multifaceted. While zoos can provide valuable educational and entertainment experiences, it is essential to ensure that animal welfare is prioritized and that these institutions operate with a commitment to conservation and ethical treatment of animals. By striking a balance between these competing interests, zoos can continue to serve as valuable resources for humanity, while also promoting the well-being and preservation of the amazing creatures that inhabit our planet.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;The method of studying is a crucial aspect of academic success, and it varies from person to person. While some students prefer to study alone, the benefits of studying in a group setting are undeniable. Personally, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends, and I believe that this activity provides numerous opportunities for growth and improvement.One of the primary advantages of group studying is the ability to receive help from my peers. When I am struggling with a particular concept or subject, my friends can offer explanations and insights that may have eluded me. This collaborative approach to learning enables me to gain a deeper understanding of the material, as we work together to clarify any misunderstandings. Moreover, being surrounded by friends who are also committed to learning creates a sense of camaraderie and motivation, which helps to keep me focused and driven.In addition to the academic support, studying in a group also provides an opportunity to improve my learning skills. By engaging in discussions and debates with my friends, I am able to develop my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, the process of explaining concepts to my peers helps to solidify my own understanding, as I am forced to articulate my thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner. This, in turn, enhances my communication skills and boosts my confidence in expressing my opinions and perspectives.Overall, I firmly believe that studying in a group of friends is an invaluable experience that offers a multitude of benefits. Not only do I receive academic support and guidance, but I also develop essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. As I continue on my academic journey, I am confident that the skills and knowledge gained through group studying will serve me well, both in and out of the classroom.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;The Value of Friendship: A Matter of Personal PreferenceFriendship is undoubtedly one of the most important values in a person's life, providing emotional support, a sense of belonging, and opportunities for personal growth. Despite its universal significance, people often have different preferences when it comes to nurturing friendships. Some individuals prefer to maintain a small, close-knit circle of friends, while others enjoy staying in contact with a large and diverse group of acquaintances. In my view, I firmly believe that having a large number of friends is more beneficial, as it offers a broader scope for learning and development.By staying in contact with a large number of friends, one is exposed to a wide range of experiences, perspectives, and ideas. This diversity can be incredibly enriching, allowing individuals to learn from others' successes and failures, and gain valuable insights into different cultures and ways of life. Moreover, a large social network provides a greater sense of security and support, as there are more people to turn to in times of need. In contrast, having a small circle of friends, while intimate and comfortable, may limit one's exposure to new ideas and experiences.Furthermore, in today's interconnected world, maintaining a large social network is easier than ever, thanks to social media and other digital platforms. This has made it possible to stay in touch with friends from all walks of life, regardless of geographical distance. In conclusion, while preferences may vary, I believe that having a large number of friends is more beneficial, as it provides a broader platform for learning, growth, and support. By embracing diversity and staying connected with a wide range of people, one can lead a more enriching, dynamic, and fulfilling life.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The world is facing a critical issue: the depletion of natural resources. One of the most effective ways to conserve these resources is by using public transportation. Instead of relying on private cars, people can opt for buses, trains, and subways, which can transport a large number of individuals while using significantly less oil and gasoline per person. This reduction in fuel consumption not only helps to conserve natural resources but also minimizes the amount of pollution released into the air.The excessive use of private cars is a major contributor to environmental degradation. The more cars are driven, the more pollution is emitted, leading to a rise in global temperatures and exacerbating the issue of climate change. In contrast, public transportation offers a cleaner and more sustainable alternative. By using public transportation, individuals can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a healthier environment.Moreover, using public transportation has a positive impact on social interactions. When people use buses, trains, and subways, they are more likely to engage with others, fostering a sense of community and sociability. This shared experience can help to break down social barriers and promote a more harmonious and connected society. In addition, public transportation provides an opportunity for people to interact with others from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and ages, broadening their perspectives and understanding of the world.In conclusion, the use of public transportation is a simple yet effective way to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and promote social interaction. By making a conscious choice to use buses, trains, and subways, individuals can contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly world. As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize the use of public transportation and work towards creating a better future for ourselves and generations to come.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate surrounding the role of zoos in animal conservation has sparked intense discussion among animal lovers and critics alike. While many people argue that zoos are a valuable asset to animals, providing them with protection and care, others hold a contrasting view, believing that animals are inferior creatures and do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, however, I strongly believe that we have a moral obligation to help animals live safely and comfortably in their own natural environment.The primary goal of zoos should be to provide a safe haven for animals that are endangered or vulnerable in the wild. Unfortunately, many zoos fall short of this goal, instead prioritizing human entertainment over animal welfare. In contrast, conservation efforts that focus on protecting and preserving natural habitats allow animals to thrive in their own environment, free from the confines of enclosures. This approach not only promotes the well-being of individual animals but also helps to maintain the delicate balance of ecosystems.Moreover, by preserving natural habitats, we can also promote biodiversity and ensure the long-term survival of species. This can be achieved through the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife reserves, where animals can roam freely and live as they would in the wild. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that animals are treated with the respect and care they deserve. By prioritizing their welfare and working to protect their natural habitats, we can help to create a safer, more sustainable world for all living creatures. By doing so, we can make a positive impact on the lives of animals and preserve the beauty and wonder of the natural world for future generations.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;As my country embarks on a new research endeavor, I firmly believe that establishing a center for agriculture research is the most prudent choice. This decision is driven by the vast potential of agriculture to positively impact our nation's development. First and foremost, a center for agriculture research can empower my fellow citizens to optimize the use of our land. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative farming practices, our agricultural sector can become more efficient and productive. This, in turn, can lead to improved food security, enhanced quality of life, and increased economic opportunities for rural communities. Our citizens will be able to better exploit the land, unlocking its full potential and contributing to the overall well-being of our society.Furthermore, the establishment of an agriculture research center can play a pivotal role in bolstering our country's economy. Currently, the agriculture sector accounts for only thirty percent of the market share, indicating substantial room for growth and expansion. By investing in research and development, we can identify new avenues for agricultural growth, improve crop yields, and diversify our agricultural products. This can lead to increased exports, higher revenues, and a more resilient economy. The potential for job creation, both directly in farming and indirectly in related industries, is also significant, further contributing to economic improvement.In conclusion, the benefits of establishing a center for agriculture research are multifaceted and far-reaching. It not only aids in the optimal utilization of our land but also presents a viable pathway to economic enhancement. Given the current underrepresentation of agriculture in our market, the potential for expansion and the positive impacts that come with it make this choice particularly compelling. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the development of a center for agriculture research as the most beneficial direction for our country's new research initiative.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;The pursuit of knowledge and skill development is a lifelong journey that requires dedication, perseverance, and a willingness to learn. People employ various methods to broaden their understanding and expertise, and one approach that I strongly advocate for is learning through hands-on experience. In my opinion, doing things by oneself is a more effective way to acquire knowledge and skills compared to merely reading about them or listening to others.Learning by doing things has numerous benefits, chief among them being the development of maturity. When we take on tasks and challenges independently, we are forced to rely on ourselves, which fosters self-reliance and autonomy. By doing things ourselves, we learn to navigate obstacles, make decisions, and take responsibility for our actions. This, in turn, builds confidence, resilience, and problem-solving skills, all of which are essential for personal and professional growth.Moreover, learning by doing things allows us to experience the practical applications of theoretical concepts, making them more tangible and memorable. When we engage in hands-on learning, we are able to see the immediate consequences of our actions, which helps to reinforce our understanding and retention of the material. Additionally, doing things ourselves enables us to develop a sense of ownership and pride in our accomplishments, which motivates us to continue learning and improving.In conclusion, learning by doing things is an invaluable approach to acquiring knowledge and skills. By taking an active, hands-on approach to learning, we develop maturity, self-reliance, and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. As such, I firmly believe that doing things by oneself is a superior method of learning, one that yields numerous benefits and sets the stage for a lifetime of personal and professional development.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air fares has revolutionized the way people travel, particularly for the lower income group. With affordable flight options, individuals who were previously unable to travel by air can now explore new destinations, both domestically and internationally. This has broadened travel possibilities for many, allowing them to experience different cultures, visit loved ones, and take breaks from their daily routines. The lower income group, in particular, has benefited greatly from this development, as they can now access modes of transportation that were once considered a luxury.However, the growing phenomenon of cheap flights has a darker side. The increased demand for air travel has led to a significant surge in air traffic, resulting in a substantial negative impact on the environment. One of the most pressing concerns is the emission of carbon dioxide from burning plane fuel. As airplanes take to the skies, they release massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and causing the Earth to heat up. This, in turn, accelerates climate change, leading to devastating consequences such as rising sea levels, intense natural disasters, and unpredictable weather patterns.The environmental cost of cheap flights is a pressing issue that cannot be ignored. While the benefits of affordable air travel are undeniable, it is essential to acknowledge the harmful effects it has on our planet. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is crucial to find a balance between accessibility and sustainability. Airlines, governments, and individuals must work together to mitigate the environmental impact of air travel, exploring alternatives such as electric or hybrid planes, and implementing measures to reduce carbon emissions. Only by acknowledging the negative consequences of cheap flights can we strive towards a more eco-friendly and responsible approach to air travel.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The rapid increase in private car ownership has led to numerous problems that affect not only the environment but also the overall quality of life. To mitigate these issues, governments should prioritize investing in the public transportation system. This strategic allocation of funds would have multiple benefits, starting with the reduction of resource consumption on transportation. By providing efficient and reliable public transportation options, as an alternative to private vehicles, the overall demand for fuel and the subsequent depletion of natural resources can be significantly decreased.Another critical advantage of public transportation is its role in combating air pollution. The emissions from private cars contribute substantially to air pollution, which has severe health and environmental impacts. By encouraging the use of public transportation, as opposed to individual car travel, the amount of pollutants released into the atmosphere can be drastically reduced, leading to cleaner air and healthier living conditions for the population.Furthermore, opting for public transportation over private car use enhances safety on the roads. According to the National Safety Council, riding a bus is a staggering 170 times safer than traveling by private car. This significant difference in safety levels underscores the importance of public transportation in reducing accidents and ensuring the well-being of commuters. By investing in public transportation, governments can simultaneously address environmental concerns, reduce the consumption of limited resources, and most importantly, save lives by minimizing the risks associated with private car travel.In conclusion, the benefits of investing in public transportation are multifaceted and far-reaching. Not only does it contribute to a more sustainable use of resources and a reduction in air pollution, but it also plays a crucial role in enhancing road safety. Given these advantages, governments should indeed allocate funds to improve and expand public transportation systems, as this investment would yield significant returns in terms of environmental protection, resource conservation, and public safety.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;The debate about whether studying in groups or individually is more beneficial has been ongoing among students. While some students thrive in group study settings, claiming that it enhances their understanding and retention of material, I firmly believe that studying individually is more effective for me. The primary reason for this preference is that it allows me to concentrate more intensely on the subject matter at hand.When I study alone, I can focus my attention solely on the material, without distractions or interruptions from others. This enables me to grasp complex concepts more easily and to review the material at my own pace. In contrast, group study sessions can sometimes devolve into social gatherings, where the actual studying takes a backseat to conversation and camaraderie.Moreover, studying individually plays a significant role in shaping our personalities, particularly in terms of responsibility and independence. For instance, when I am tasked with completing my homework alone, I am compelled to take full ownership of the assignment. This sense of accountability encourages me to be more diligent and self-motivated, as I know that I alone am responsible for the quality of my work. By working independently, I develop essential life skills such as time management, self-discipline, and problem-solving, all of which are crucial for success not just in academics, but in professional and personal life as well.In conclusion, while group studying may offer benefits for some, I find that studying individually better suits my learning style and personal growth. It fosters a deeper understanding of the material, promotes concentration, and contributes to the development of vital personal traits like responsibility and independence. These skills, honed through solo study efforts, will undoubtedly serve as a strong foundation for my future academic and professional pursuits.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The Earth's environment is facing a grave crisis due to human activities. People are polluting the planet at an alarming rate, releasing toxic chemicals and waste into the air, water, and soil. This not only harms the environment but also exhausts natural resources, threatening the very foundation of life on Earth. The depletion of natural resources such as oil, coal, and gas is a significant concern. These resources are being consumed at an unprecedented rate, with little regard for sustainability or conservation.The consequences of these actions are far-reaching and devastating. The pollution of the air, water, and soil is not only harming human health but also endangering the lives of other species. Many species are facing extinction due to habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution. The delicate balance of ecosystems is being disrupted, with potentially catastrophic consequences. The loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems will have severe and long-lasting impacts on the planet.It is imperative that we take immediate action to address these issues. We must adopt sustainable practices, such as reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, conserving water, and reducing waste. We must also protect and preserve natural habitats, and work to restore damaged ecosystems. Additionally, we must take steps to mitigate climate change, which is exacerbating the depletion of natural resources and the endangerment of other species. By working together, we can reduce our impact on the environment and ensure a healthy and thriving planet for future generations. It is our responsibility to act as stewards of the Earth and to protect the natural resources and species that call it home.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";The state of our ecosystem has never been more precarious. The alarming rate of environmental degradation has brought us to a critical juncture, where immediate and drastic measures are necessary to mitigate the damage. If we fail to take decisive action now, the consequences will be catastrophic and irreversible. It is imperative that we prioritize environmental protection and make it a cornerstone of our collective efforts.One of the most effective ways to promote environmental protection is through advertising. By supporting eco-friendly initiatives and showcasing sustainable practices, companies can not only contribute to the preservation of our planet but also enhance their brand reputation. In fact, studies have shown that supporting environmental protection is a more efficient method of advertising, as it resonates with the growing demographic of environmentally conscious consumers. By embracing sustainability,Moreover, conservation efforts have a direct correlation with a higher standard of living. By preserving natural resources, as well as protecting biodiversity, we can ensure that future generations inherit a thriving and healthy environment. This, in turn, will lead to improved public health, In conclusion, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever, and it is high time that we take responsibility for our actions and work towards a more sustainable future. By prioritizing environmental protection and conservation, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations. It is our moral obligation to act now and make a positive impact on the planet. The time for procrastination is over, and the time for action is now.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;A good co-worker is an essential component of a successful and harmonious work environment. Among the numerous qualities that define a good co-worker, there are three most important characteristics that stand out: cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship. These traits are the foundation upon which positive and productive working relationships are built.First and foremost, cooperation is a vital characteristic of a good co-worker. When individuals cooperate, they work together towards a common goal, sharing their skills, knowledge, and ideas. This collaborative approach not only enhances the quality of work but also fosters a sense of unity and teamwork. On the other hand, if co-workers do not cooperate, it can lead to numerous disputes and conflicts, ultimately hindering the progress and success of the organization. Disputes can arise from misunderstandings, differences in opinion, and lack of communication, all of which can be mitigated by a cooperative attitude.Trustworthiness is another crucial characteristic of a good co-worker. When co-workers are trustworthy, they demonstrate reliability, integrity, and honesty in their interactions and work. This trait is essential for building strong working relationships, as it allows individuals to depend on each other and work together seamlessly. Trustworthiness also promotes a sense of security and stability, which is vital for a productive and efficient work environment.Lastly, fellowship is a characteristic that complements cooperation and trustworthiness. It refers to the sense of camaraderie and friendship that develops among co-workers. When co-workers exhibit fellowship, they demonstrate a willingness to support, encourage, and care for one another, both personally and professionally. This trait is essential for creating a positive and enjoyable work environment, where individuals feel valued, respected, and motivated to contribute their best. In conclusion, cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship are the three most important characteristics of a good co-worker. These traits are interdependent and collectively contribute to a harmonious, productive, and successful work environment.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;The digital age has revolutionized the way we learn, with online classes becoming increasingly popular and common in society. As a result, the debate about whether online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning has gained momentum. In my opinion, online classes have several advantages that make them an attractive alternative to traditional classroom learning.Firstly, online classes offer flexibility and convenience, allowing students to learn at their own pace and from any location. This is particularly beneficial for students who have work or family commitments, or those who live in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Online classes also provide access to a wide range of courses and resources that may not be available in traditional classroom settings.However, I do not think that online computer classes should completely replace classroom learning. Traditional classrooms provide a unique learning environment that fosters social interaction, human connection, and hands-on experience. Face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers is essential for developing important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Moreover, traditional classrooms provide a structured learning environment that helps students stay motivated and focused.In conclusion, while online computer classes have their advantages, I believe that they should complement traditional classroom learning rather than replace it. A blended learning approach that combines the flexibility of online classes with the social interaction and hands-on experience of traditional classrooms would be the most effective way to deliver education in the digital age. By leveraging the strengths of both online and traditional learning, we can create a more engaging, effective, and inclusive education system that prepares students for success in the 21st century.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The notion that students should be free not to attend classes may seem unconventional, but it has numerous benefits that can enhance the overall quality of student life, learning motivation, and the acquisition of essential life skills. By allowing students the autonomy to decide when to attend classes, educational institutions can foster a more mature and self-directed approach to learning.Firstly, this freedom improves the quality of student life by reducing unnecessary stress and pressure associated with mandatory attendance. When students are not forced to attend every class, they can manage their time more effectively, prioritize their well-being, and balance academic responsibilities with personal interests. This flexibility can lead to better mental health, as students are able to take breaks when needed, thereby avoiding burnout.Secondly, the freedom not to attend classes can boost learning motivation. When students are given the choice, they are more likely to attend classes that genuinely interest them, leading to a more engaged and motivated learning experience. This autonomy can help students develop a sense of responsibility and ownership over their learning process, which is crucial for sustained motivation and academic success.Moreover, being free to stay away from classes teaches important life skills such as time management, prioritization, and self-discipline. In the real world, individuals are not always mandated to be in a specific place at a specific time unless absolutely necessary. Thus, learning to manage one’s time effectively and make responsible decisions about attendance is a valuable skill that prepares students for their future careers and personal lives.Lastly, this approach improves flexibility, allowing students to adapt their schedules according to their needs, whether academic, personal, or professional. In a rapidly changing world, the ability to be flexible and adapt quickly is a significant advantage, and educational systems should reflect this reality.In conclusion, giving students the freedom not to attend classes can have a profoundly positive impact on their academic journey, personal development, and future readiness. It is an approach that recognizes the importance of autonomy, self-motivation, and the development of critical life skills, all of which are essential for success in an ever-evolving world.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, I find myself gravitating towards the charm of small towns. The idea of living in a close-knit community, surrounded by natural beauty and a slower pace of life, is highly appealing to me. One of the primary advantages of small towns is the desirable quality of life they offer. The weather is often more pleasant, and the air is fresher, allowing for a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, small towns often boast better facilities, such as parks, community centers, and local shops, which foster a sense of community and provide ample opportunities for socialization and recreation.Another significant advantage of small towns is the lower cost of living. In today's society, living costs are a major concern for many individuals, and small towns offer a more affordable alternative to big cities. The cost of housing, food, and transportation is significantly lower, making it easier for people to make ends meet. Moreover, the close relationships and strong social bonds that form in small towns often lead to better deals and more favorable prices among community members. In contrast, big cities can be overwhelming and isolating, leaving people feeling alone and disconnected from those around them.In small towns, people are more likely to know and interact with their neighbors, fostering a sense of belonging and cooperation. This camaraderie is often absent in big cities, where anonymity and disconnection can prevail. Overall, I firmly believe that small towns offer a unique and desirable way of life, characterized by good weather, healthy living, better facilities, and lower living costs. The strong social bonds and sense of community that define small towns make them an attractive option for those seeking a more relaxed, affordable, and connected lifestyle.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;The migration of young people from rural areas to urban centers has become a prevalent phenomenon in recent years. Driven by the pursuit of better job prospects and access to quality education, this trend has been gaining momentum. However, I strongly disapprove of this trend due to its far-reaching negative consequences.One of the primary concerns is the significant decline in the quality of life for these young migrants. Upon arriving in cities, they often find themselves struggling to adapt to the fast-paced and competitive environment. The high cost of living, coupled with the scarcity of affordable housing, forces many to live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. This not only takes a toll on their physical health but also leads to increased stress levels and decreased overall well-being.Furthermore, the influx of people into cities has devastating effects on the environment. The rapid urbanization resulting from this migration leads to increased air and water pollution, as well as the destruction of natural habitats. The strain on already overburdened city infrastructure, such as transportation and waste management systems, exacerbates the problem. As a result, the environment suffers, and the quality of life for all city residents is compromised.In conclusion, while the intention behind the migration of young people from rural areas to cities is understandable, the negative repercussions cannot be overlooked. It is essential for governments and policymakers to address the root causes of this trend, such as lack of opportunities and resources in rural areas, and work towards creating a more balanced and sustainable development across all regions. By doing so, we can mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization and ensure a better quality of life for all individuals, regardless of their geographical location.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;In today's fast-paced community, the economy has become the order of the day. It is an undeniable fact that economic knowledge and skills are essential for individuals to navigate and succeed in the modern world. As such, it is crucial for individuals to jump into the field of economics as early as possible. The earlier one starts, the more skillful and adept they will become in handling economic concepts, theories, and practices.By introducing economics at a young age, individuals can develop a strong foundation in financial literacy, budgeting, and investing. This, in turn, enables them to make informed decisions about their financial resources, leading to a more stable and secure future. Moreover, having a head start in economics can also give individuals a competitive edge in the job market, as they will be better equipped to understand and analyze economic trends, patterns, and fluctuations.Furthermore, taking basic economic courses can also prove to be beneficial for students when they attend college. Many colleges and universities offer economics as a major or minor, and having prior knowledge of economic principles can give students a significant advantage. They will be able to build upon their existing knowledge, explore advanced economic concepts, and develop specialized skills in areas such as microeconomics, macroeconomics, or international trade. This, in turn, can lead to better academic performance, increased confidence, and enhanced career prospects.In conclusion, it is evident that gaining an early understanding of economics is vital in today's community. By acquiring economic knowledge and skills from an early age, individuals can set themselves up for success, make informed financial decisions, and gain a competitive edge in the job market. Additionally, basic economic courses can provide a solid foundation for students to excel in college, paving the way for a brighter and more prosperous future.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The debate about university eligibility has sparked a heated discussion in recent years. On one hand, it is argued that outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. This is because these students have demonstrated exceptional academic prowess, which is often seen as a prerequisite for university admission. Their intellectual capacity enables them to excel in academic studies, thereby making them ideal candidates for higher education.However, university is not just about academic studies, but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Many students who may not excel academically may possess exceptional artistic or creative abilities that can be honed and refined at the university level. Furthermore, university provides a platform for students to develop essential soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are vital in the real world. By restricting university admission to only academically gifted students, the potential of these creatively inclined students may be stifled.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. On the one hand, restricting admission to outstanding academic students ensures that only those who are intellectually prepared for the rigors of university studies are admitted. This can lead to a more focused and productive academic environment. On the other hand, such restrictions may deny talented individuals who do not fit the traditional academic mold the opportunity to develop their skills and reach their full potential. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both academic achievement and other forms of talent and ability is necessary to create a holistic and inclusive university environment. By doing so, we can foster a diverse and dynamic community that values and nurtures all forms of excellence.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state has evolved to encompass a wide range of responsibilities, with a significant emphasis on healthcare and health education. Governments are no longer just providers of basic necessities, but are also expected to ensure the well-being and health of their citizens. This includes providing sustainable healthcare systems, as well as health education to promote preventive care and healthy lifestyles.The importance of healthcare and health education cannot be overstated. A healthy population is more productive, contributing to the overall economic growth and development of a country. Furthermore, a well-informed population is better equipped to make healthy choices, reducing the burden on healthcare systems. However, the current allocation of resources often prioritizes treatment over prevention and education. This approach is not only costly but also less effective in the long run.A more sustainable and efficient approach would be to allocate a greater proportion of the budget to education and prevention issues. By investing in health education, governments can empower citizens with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their health. Preventive measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and healthy lifestyle promotions can significantly reduce the incidence of diseases, thereby decreasing the need for costly treatments. This proactive approach not only improves health outcomes but also reduces the financial strain on healthcare systems.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. This strategic allocation of resources will lead to a healthier, more informed population, and ultimately, a more sustainable healthcare system. By prioritizing prevention and education, governments can fulfill their role in the welfare state more effectively, contributing to the overall well-being and prosperity of their citizens. This forward-thinking approach is essential for building resilient and healthy communities, capable of thriving in today's challenging world.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"The importance of non-academic subjects in a student's development cannot be overstated. While academic subjects are undoubtedly crucial, it is equally essential to recognize the value of non-academic subjects, such as physical education, in shaping a well-rounded individual. Physical education, in particular, is often overlooked as a vital component of a student's curriculum, but its removal from the syllabus would have considerable negative effects on students' health. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and without it, students may be more prone to obesity, related health issues, and decreased physical fitness.Schools have a responsibility that extends beyond imparting academic knowledge; they are also tasked with developing their students into capable, well-rounded individuals. This encompasses not only academic achievement but also the development of practical life skills, emotional intelligence, and physical well-being. Success in life requires a multifaceted approach, where academic knowledge is complemented by the ability to interact socially, manage time effectively, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Non-academic subjects play a pivotal role in fostering these skills, ensuring that students are equipped to navigate the challenges of adulthood successfully.In conclusion, non-academic subjects, including physical education, are as essential as academic subjects for a student's holistic development. The removal of physical education from school syllabuses would not only harm students' physical health but also undermine their ability to develop into well-rounded, capable individuals. Schools must prioritize a balanced curriculum that includes both academic rigor and non-academic subjects to prepare students for success in all aspects of life. By doing so, they can ensure that future generations are equipped with the academic knowledge, practical skills, and physical well-being necessary to thrive in an increasingly complex and demanding world."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals relocate to a new country, they are often faced with a crucial decision: whether to adopt the customs of their new homeland or cling to their traditional practices. This dilemma poses a significant challenge, as it can impact their ability to integrate into their new society. On one hand, embracing the customs of the new country can facilitate a smoother transition and easier assimilation. By adopting local traditions and norms, individuals can more readily connect with their new community, build relationships, and establish a sense of belonging.In contrast, insisting on maintaining one's original customs and refusing to accept the new ones can lead to social isolation and a sense of detachment. When people cling to their traditional practices and reject the local culture, they may be perceived as setting themselves apart from the rest of society. This can result in them being regarded as a special or separate group, which can hinder their ability to fully integrate into their new community. Furthermore, this stubborn adherence to one's own customs can also lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications with the local population, thereby exacerbating the challenges of adapting to a new environment.However, it is also important to acknowledge the value of preserving one's cultural heritage. A balanced approach, which combines the adoption of new customs with the preservation of traditional practices, can be the most effective way to navigate this dilemma. By being open to new experiences and willing to learn, individuals can broaden their cultural understanding and foster greater mutual respect between different communities. Ultimately, the decision to follow new customs or maintain traditional ones is a personal choice, and finding a harmonious balance between the two can be the key to a successful and enriching experience in a new country.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;The Importance of Working Alone: A Key to Achieving Brilliant ResultsIn today's world, the importance of teamwork is often emphasized, and for good reason. Collaborating with others can lead to innovative ideas, shared workload, and a sense of camaraderie. However, I firmly believe that the ability to work alone is even more significant. While teamwork is valuable, there are numerous situations where individual effort is not only preferred, but required.For instance, many standardized tests and exams are designed to assess individual knowledge and understanding, without the option of teamwork. To excel in these evaluations, one must be able to work independently, relying on their own skills and knowledge. If a student aspires to attend a prestigious college or achieve outstanding results in their school's final tests, they must be able to perform well under their own steam. This is where the capability to work alone becomes crucial.By learning to work on their own, individuals can develop a range of essential skills, including self-motivation, time management, and problem-solving. These skills are not only beneficial for academic success but also for personal growth and professional development. Moreover, working alone allows individuals to take full ownership of their work, which can lead to a greater sense of pride and accomplishment.In conclusion, while teamwork has its benefits, I believe that the ability to work alone is more significant. It is a vital skill that can help individuals achieve brilliant results, particularly in academic and professional settings. By developing this capability, individuals can unlock their full potential, achieve their goals, and succeed in an increasingly competitive world. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the importance of working alone and to cultivate this skill in order to reach new heights of success.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";"The notion that we should solely focus on our jobs is a common one, but I strongly disagree. In my opinion, having hobbies and engaging in physical activities is essential for maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Not only do these pursuits keep our bodies fit, but they also provide a much-needed respite from the monotony of daily work routines.Doing the same task for an extended period can be dull and unfulfilling, leading to mental fatigue and boredom. This is where hobbies come in - they offer a refreshing change of pace and a chance to recharge our minds. Whether it's reading, painting, or playing sports, having a hobby outside of work allows us to express ourselves creatively and explore new interests.One hobby that I believe is particularly beneficial is playing a musical instrument. Music has a unique ability to evoke emotions and provide an outlet for self-expression. When we're feeling depressed or pressured, playing an instrument can be a therapeutic way to channel our emotions and clear our minds. The calming effects of music can help to reduce stress and anxiety, promoting a sense of well-being and calmness.In conclusion, having hobbies and engaging in physical activities is vital for our overall well-being. It's not just about working and earning a living; it's about living a fulfilling and balanced life. By making time for hobbies and creative pursuits, we can refresh our minds, express ourselves, and maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. So, rather than solely focusing on our jobs, I firmly believe that we should prioritize our hobbies and make time for the activities that bring us joy and fulfillment."
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The world has been plagued by pollution, noise, and casualties for far too long. Many countries have struggled to find effective solutions to these interrelated problems, which have significant impacts on both the environment and human health. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways, and there are three crucial reasons that support this stance.Firstly, improving roads and highways can greatly reduce the amount of pollution emitted by vehicles. By constructing roads that are designed to minimize traffic congestion, the overall idling time of vehicles can be decreased, which in turn reduces the emission of harmful pollutants. Moreover, well-maintained roads encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling or walking, which produce zero emissions.Secondly, enhancing the infrastructure of roads and highways can significantly decrease noise levels. A smooth and even road surface can minimize the noise generated by vehicles, creating a more peaceful environment for residents living nearby. This is especially important for urban areas, where high noise levels can have serious health implications, including increased stress and hearing loss.Lastly, improving roads and highways can greatly reduce the number of casualties resulting from traffic accidents. Well-designed roads with clear signage and markings can minimize confusion among drivers, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents. Furthermore, the implementation of safety features such as crash barriers and emergency response systems can mitigate the severity of accidents when they do occur.In conclusion, improving roads and highways is a multifaceted solution that addresses the problems of pollution, noise, and casualties. By reducing pollution, minimizing noise levels, and enhancing safety, improved road infrastructure can have a profoundly positive impact on both the environment and human well-being. As such, it is imperative that governments and urban planners prioritize the development and maintenance of roads and highways to create a healthier and more sustainable future.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;As I reflect on the ways to learn about life, I firmly believe that there are two main approaches: listening to the advice of family and friends, and learning through personal experience. Both methods have their own distinct advantages, making them valuable in their own right. On one hand, seeking guidance from loved ones can provide a more realistic understanding of the world. By listening to their advice, we can gain valuable insights and lessons learned from their own experiences, allowing us to navigate life's challenges with more ease.For instance, family and friends can offer warnings about potential pitfalls and provide guidance on how to make informed decisions. Their advice can serve as a shortcut, saving us from making costly mistakes and sparing us from unnecessary hardships. Moreover, their words of wisdom can provide emotional support and comfort, helping us to stay motivated and focused on our goals. However, I personally believe that learning through personal experience is a more effective way to acquire knowledge about life. By navigating life's challenges on my own, I can develop a deeper understanding of myself and the world around me.Through trial and error, I can discover my own strengths and weaknesses, and develop the resilience and resourcefulness needed to overcome obstacles. Personal experience also allows me to develop my own unique perspective and approach to problem-solving, enabling me to make decisions that are tailored to my individual needs and circumstances. While listening to advice can provide a foundation for learning, I believe that personal experience is essential for true growth and self-discovery. Ultimately, both ways of learning are essential, and I believe that a balance between seeking guidance and forging my own path is the key to a rich and fulfilling life.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. This stage is marked by innocence, curiosity, and a carefree attitude, which contributes to an overall sense of joy and contentment. Most people are happier during their childhood than in adulthood, as they are free from the burdens and responsibilities that come with growing up.A child's daily life is simple, yet fulfilling. It typically consists of attending school, playing with friends, and getting plenty of rest. This routine allows children to learn, grow, and explore their surroundings without the pressures of adulthood. School provides a foundation for knowledge and socialization, while playtime fosters creativity, physical activity, and emotional development. A good night's sleep ensures that children are well-rested and ready to take on the next day's adventures.Childhood is also a time of unbridled creativity. Children are known for their vivid imaginations, artistic expressions, and innovative thinking. Uninhibited by the constraints of reality, children are free to dream, create, and experiment without fear of failure. This creative spark is often dimmed as people enter adulthood, where practicality and responsibility take precedence. However, it is this childhood creativity that lays the foundation for future innovators, artists, and problem-solvers.In conclusion, childhood is a unique and special time in a person's life, marked by happiness, simplicity, and creativity. As people grow into adulthood, they often look back on their childhood with nostalgia, remembering the joy and freedom of their youth. By embracing the qualities of childhood, such as curiosity, creativity, and a carefree attitude, people can carry the happiness and wonder of this stage into their adult lives, leading to a more fulfilling and joyful existence.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we prepare and consume food. In modern days, food preparation has become significantly easier and more convenient, thanks to the plethora of kitchen appliances available. Appliances such as microwaves and toasters have made cooking a breeze, allowing individuals to prepare meals quickly and efficiently.Gone are the days of tedious and time-consuming cooking processes. With the click of a button, meals can be cooked to perfection in a matter of minutes. This convenience has been particularly liberating for housewives, who traditionally bore the brunt of cooking responsibilities. No longer are they tied to the kitchen for hours, slaving away over a hot stove. Instead, they now have the freedom to pursue more meaningful activities, such as hobbies, education, or even career advancement.The impact of this change cannot be overstated. Housewives, who were once confined to the kitchen, now have the time and energy to explore their passions and interests. They can use this extra time to learn new skills, volunteer, or even start their own businesses. This, in turn, has led to a more empowered and independent generation of women, who are no longer defined solely by their domestic duties.Furthermore, the convenience of modern cooking has also enabled people to lead healthier and more balanced lifestyles. With the ability to quickly and easily prepare nutritious meals, individuals can prioritize their health and wellbeing, without sacrificing flavor or convenience. In conclusion, the advancement of technology has revolutionized the way we prepare food, liberating housewives from the drudgery of cooking and empowering them to pursue more meaningful activities. As technology continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see the further impact it has on our daily lives and culinary habits.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The trend of young adults living with their parents for a longer period has become increasingly common in recent years. While some may view this as a negative phenomenon, it has numerous benefits for both the children and the parents. One of the most significant advantages of living with parents longer is the creation of lasting memories. By residing with their parents, young adults can strengthen their bond and create unforgettable experiences with their family.Living with parents longer also has a significant financial advantage. When children reside with their parents, they can save a substantial amount of money on expenses such as rent, food, and utilities. This allows them to allocate their income towards more meaningful pursuits, such as education, career development, or saving for the future. In essence, parents can save money if their children live with them longer, as it reduces the financial burden of supporting their children independently.Furthermore, living with parents provides young adults with the opportunity to seek advice and guidance from their parents. Parents have a wealth of experience and knowledge that they can share with their children, helping them navigate the challenges of adulthood. This advice can be invaluable in making important life decisions, such as career choices, relationships, and financial planning. By living with their parents, young adults can tap into this wisdom and gain a deeper understanding of the world.In conclusion, living with parents longer has numerous benefits, including the creation of lasting memories, financial savings, and access to valuable advice. By residing with their parents, young adults can strengthen their family bond, reduce their expenses, and gain valuable insights into adulthood. Ultimately, parents can save money if their children live with them longer, making it a win-win situation for both parties.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;The zoo plays a vital role in our society, serving as a hub for learning, conservation, and entertainment. One of the most significant contributions of zoos is their role in educating the public about the importance of wildlife conservation. By providing a platform for people to interact with and learn about various animal species, zoos help raise awareness about the plight of endangered species and the need to protect them. This educational aspect of zoos is crucial in inspiring future generations to take an active role in preserving our planet's biodiversity.In addition to their educational value, zoos are also instrumental in helping to bring species back from the brink of extinction. Through breeding programs and conservation efforts, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered animals to thrive and multiply. By doing so, they help to increase the population of these species, thereby reducing the risk of extinction. This conservation work is essential in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and ensuring the long-term survival of species that are under threat due to human activities such as habitat destruction and hunting.Furthermore, zoos are also a significant tourist attraction, drawing in millions of visitors each year. This not only boosts the local economy but also helps to promote a sense of community and appreciation for wildlife. By providing a fun and interactive environment, zoos offer a unique opportunity for people to connect with nature and develop a deeper understanding and respect for the natural world. In conclusion, zoos are a vital institution that serves multiple purposes, from education and conservation to entertainment and economic growth. As such, they should be supported and protected to ensure the continued well-being of our planet's precious wildlife. By doing so, we can help to preserve the beauty and diversity of nature for future generations to enjoy.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The Role of Parents in Shaping a Child's FutureParents play a vital role in the development and growth of their children. From a very young age, parents are the first teachers who guide their babies through the initial stages of life, teaching them essential skills such as walking and speaking. These fundamental skills are not only crucial for a child's physical and cognitive development but also lay the foundation for their future success. As children grow, parents continue to nurture and shape their behavior, values, and morals, helping them become good individuals.Based on love and a deep desire to see their children thrive, parents strive to create a supportive and conducive environment that fosters healthy development. They provide their children with the necessary tools and resources to grow, learn, and explore the world around them. This includes not only providing for their physical needs but also offering emotional support, guidance, and encouragement. By doing so, parents prepare their children for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, equipping them with the skills, the confidence, and the resilience needed to navigate life's complexities.The impact of parental love and dedication on a child's life cannot be overstated. It is through the unconditional love and support of their parents that children develop a sense of security, self-worth, and purpose. This, in turn, empowers them to pursue their dreams, build strong relationships, and contribute positively to society. In essence, parents are the architects of their children's future, laying the groundwork for their successes and happiness. As such, the role of parents in teaching, guiding, and nurturing their children is indispensable, making them the most significant influence in a child's life. Through their tireless efforts, parents shape not only their children's futures but also the future of their communities and the world at large.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The impact of television on children has been a topic of debate among parents, educators, and researchers. Many people argue that television has negative effects on children, as it can expose them to violent or inappropriate content. However, if used wisely, television can have more positive effects than negative ones.On the one hand, it is true that some television programs can be harmful to children. Violent or explicit content can desensitize children to aggression and promote unhealthy behaviors. Moreover, excessive television watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Nevertheless, if parents and caregivers guide children in their television viewing, the benefits can outweigh the drawbacks.On the other hand, television can be a valuable educational tool for children. Many programs, such as documentaries, educational shows, and children's series, can enhance their knowledge, cognitive skills, and creativity. For instance, shows like Sesame Street and Blue's Clues can teach children important skills like literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving. Additionally, television can broaden children's perspectives, introducing them to different cultures, traditions, and ways of life. This can foster empathy, understanding, and tolerance, essential values for their social and emotional development.In conclusion, while television can have negative effects on children if not used wisely, its positive effects can be substantial if children are guided in their viewing. By selecting appropriate programs, setting limits, and engaging in discussions with children about what they watch, parents and caregivers can help them reap the benefits of television while minimizing its risks. Ultimately, television can be a powerful tool for learning, growth, and development, and its wise use can have a lasting, positive impact on children's lives.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;The notion that hiring employees for their entire lives is the key to ensuring productivity and efficiency has been a long-standing hypothesis among entrepreneurs. However, from my perspective, this assumption is not only conservative but also out-of-date. In fact, I strongly believe that businesses should not employ workers for their whole life, and there are three main crucial reasons that support this stance.Firstly, the ever-changing nature of technology and industry demands that businesses remain adaptable and agile. Hiring employees for life can lead to stagnation and complacency, as workers may feel less motivated to continuously update their skills and knowledge. By contrast, a more flexible workforce allows companies to bring in fresh talent and perspectives, driving innovation and staying ahead of the competition.Secondly, a lifetime employment policy can result in a lack of diversity and creativity within the organization. When employees are hired for life, there is limited opportunity for new blood to enter the company, leading to a homogenous workforce that may struggle to think outside the box. On the other hand, a dynamic workforce with regular turnover allows for the introduction of new ideas, experiences, and perspectives, ultimately leading to a more innovative and creative work environment.Lastly, hiring employees for life can lead to significant financial burdens for companies, particularly in terms of pension and retirement obligations. By not employing workers for their entire lives, businesses can avoid these long-term financial commitments, allowing them to allocate resources more efficiently and effectively. In conclusion, while some entrepreneurs may believe that hiring employees for life is the key to productivity and efficiency, I firmly believe that this approach is outdated and that businesses should adopt a more flexible and dynamic approach to employment.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";Childhood is often regarded as the happiest period of one's life, and for good reason. It is a time of wonder, discovery, and unbridled joy. In several aspects, childhood stands out as a unique and special stage of human development. One of the most striking features of childhood is the sense of surprise that permeates daily life. Children are constantly encountering new experiences, meeting new people, and learning new things, which fills their lives with a sense of awe and curiosity.Another great aspect of childhood is the freedom to imagine and express oneself without inhibition. Children are not yet bound by the conventions and expectations of society, and as such, they are able to think and say what they think without fear of judgment. This freedom allows them to explore their creativity, to dream big, and to imagine a world full of possibilities. Whether it's through play, art, or make-believe, children are able to express themselves in a way that is authentic and true to who they are.This combination of surprise and freedom makes childhood a truly magical time. Children are able to approach the world with a sense of wonder and curiosity, unencumbered by the worries and concerns of adulthood. As a result, childhood is often remembered as a happy and carefree time, one that is looked back upon with nostalgia and fondness. In conclusion, childhood is indeed the happiest period of one's life, a time of discovery, imagination, and joy. It is a stage of life that should be cherished and celebrated, and one that lays the foundation for a happy and fulfilling life.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";"The notion that ""the past has nothing to do with the present, as time never stops"" is a common misconception held by many. However, this idea couldn't be further from the truth. The past is a treasure trove of valuable lessons, experiences, and knowledge that can greatly benefit our present and future. By studying and learning from past events, successes, and mistakes, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and its complexities.History is replete with examples of triumphs and failures that can serve as guides for our decision-making and problem-solving. By examining the successes of the past, we can identify the factors that contributed to their achievements and apply them to our own endeavors. Conversely, analyzing past mistakes can help us avoid similar pitfalls and develop more effective strategies. Moreover, the past is a rich source of knowledge in various fields of study, including science, art, and philosophy. The discoveries and innovations of the past have paved the way for modern breakthroughs and continue to influence our understanding of the world.Rather than ignoring the past, we should make full use of it to build a brighter future. By learning from the experiences and achievements of our predecessors, we can accelerate progress, avoid repeating mistakes, and create a better world. The past is not just a series of outdated events, but a valuable resource that can inform and enrich our present and future. Therefore, it is essential that we acknowledge the significance of the past and harness its power to create a more enlightened, innovative, and prosperous tomorrow. By doing so, we can ensure that the lessons of the past are not lost, but rather, used to forge a brighter, more promising future."
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The 20th century marked a significant milestone in human history, as space exploration became a reality. For the first time, humans were able to venture beyond the confines of our planet, sparking a new era of discovery and advancement. In my opinion, allocating a significant budget to space exploration is a crucial investment in the future of humanity. The benefits of space exploration extend far beyond the realm of scientific discovery, as it has the potential to ensure the long-term survival of our species.During the Cold War, space exploration was utilized as a tool for military power, with both the United States and the Soviet Union engaging in a heated space race. This rivalry drove innovation and pushed the boundaries of what was thought possible. However, the true value of space exploration lies not in its military applications, but in its potential to unlock new resources, technologies, and habitats for humanity. By exploring and understanding the vast expanse of space, we may uncover new sources of energy, materials, and even new homes for our species.Furthermore, space exploration has the potential to address some of the most pressing issues facing humanity, such as climate change, overpopulation, and resource depletion. By expanding our presence in space, we may be able to tap into new resources, such as solar energy and asteroid mining, and establish sustainable habitats that can support human life. In conclusion, spending on space exploration is not a luxury, but a necessity for the survival and advancement of humanity. As we continue to push the boundaries of space exploration, we may uncover new and innovative solutions to the challenges facing our planet, and ensure a bright and sustainable future for generations to come.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day, revolutionizing the way we access information, entertainment, and connect with others. While some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I firmly believe it has done the opposite. Television has bridged the gap between people, fostering a sense of community and shared experience.On one hand, critics argue that excessive TV watching leads to social isolation, as individuals spend more time alone in front of the screen rather than engaging in face-to-face interactions. However, I disagree with this perspective. Television has brought people together, creating common topics of conversation and shared interests. For instance, families and friends often gather around the TV to watch their favorite shows, sports, or news programs, sparking discussions and debates. This collective viewing experience strengthens bonds and creates lasting memories.Moreover, television has made it possible for people to connect with others across geographical distances. With the advent of satellite TV and international channels, people can now watch programs from different cultures and countries, broadening their understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives. This global connectivity has fostered empathy, tolerance, and cooperation among nations.In conclusion, television has not devastated communication among friends and families, but rather enhanced it. By providing a shared platform for entertainment, information, and education, TV has brought people closer together, fostering a sense of community and social connection. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that television will remain an integral part of our daily lives, continuing to bridge the gap between individuals and cultures, and promoting global understanding and cooperation.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;The age-old dilemma of whether to intervene when a friend is about to make a mistake has sparked a heated debate among many. While some argue that taking action to prevent a mistake is the best course of action, others claim that letting a friend learn from their own errors is the better option, even if it means risking the friendship. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion that letting a friend make a mistake is indeed better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Firstly, letting a friend make a mistake allows them to learn and grow from their own experiences. When we intervene and prevent our friends from making mistakes, we deprive them of the opportunity to learn valuable lessons that can shape their decision-making and problem-solving skills. By allowing them to make mistakes, we enable them to develop resilience, self-awareness, and critical thinking, all of which are essential for personal growth and development. Moreover, when friends learn from their own mistakes, they are more likely to remember the lessons and apply them in the future, rather than relying on others to bail them out.Secondly, taking action to prevent a friend from making a mistake can often be perceived as controlling or paternalistic, which can lead to resentment and damage the friendship. When we intervene, our friends may feel that we do not trust them to make their own decisions or that we are trying to exert control over their lives. This can lead to feelings of anger, hurt, and betrayal, which can be difficult to repair. In contrast, letting a friend make a mistake shows that we respect their autonomy and trust them to learn from their own experiences, which can ultimately strengthen the friendship and foster a deeper sense of mutual respect and trust.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;In my view, it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare them for adult life for several compelling reasons. Firstly, when children secure a job, they are able to earn money independently, rather than relying on pocket money from their parents. This newfound financial autonomy not only boosts their self-esteem but also teaches them the value of hard-earned money. By earning their own keep, teenagers develop a sense of financial responsibility, learning to budget and manage their earnings wisely.Moreover, a part-time job provides teenagers with invaluable lessons in accountability and time management. For instance, if a student is frequently late for work, the company may reduce their payment or even terminate their employment. Under such circumstances, they will quickly learn the importance of adhering to rules and taking responsibility for their work. Punctuality and reliability become essential skills, as they understand that their actions have direct consequences on their job security and income. This discipline, in turn, benefits their academic and personal life, as they become more organized and respectful of time commitments.Engaging in part-time work during teenage years lays a robust foundation for future career success and independence. It equips them with essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, all of which are crucial in the adult workforce. Furthermore, the experience and confidence gained from part-time employment can significantly enhance their future job prospects, making the transition into adulthood smoother and more assured. In conclusion, part-time jobs offer teenage children a comprehensive preparation for adult life, fostering financial independence, accountability, and invaluable life skills that set them up for success in their future endeavors.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;The age-old debate about the merits of city life versus country life has been a longstanding one. While some may argue that the countryside offers a more peaceful and serene environment, I firmly believe that a big city is the better place to live, grow, and raise a family.In a big city, one is exposed to a diverse range of people from different backgrounds, cultures, and walks of life. This melting pot of individuals provides a unique opportunity for socialization, learning, and personal growth. Furthermore, cities offer a wide array of activities, entertainment options, and educational resources, catering to various interests and hobbies. In contrast, the countryside can be quite limiting in terms of opportunities and experiences.On the other hand, the countryside is often characterized by a more competitive and pressured environment when it comes to education. Students are required to study extensively to pass rigorous tests and gain admission to universities. While education is crucial, the intense focus on academic achievement can be overwhelming and stressful. Additionally, the countryside is not immune to gossip and rumors, which can be damaging to one's reputation and mental well-being.For these reasons, if I were to have children in the future, I am convinced that I would want them to grow up in the city. The city offers a more well-rounded and enriching environment, with countless opportunities for exploration, learning, and development. In the city, my children would be able to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, engage in various activities, and pursue their passions without the constraints and pressures often found in the countryside. Ultimately, I believe that the city provides a more nurturing and stimulating environment for children to grow, learn, and thrive.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;The influence of parents on their children is unparalleled. The things that parents say have great power to shape their child's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In fact, their words have more power than any friend or other adult could have, as they are the primary source of guidance and wisdom for their child. This is largely due to the significant amount of time children spend with their parents, which far exceeds the time spent with other people.As a result, parents have a unique opportunity to teach, mentor, and shape their child's development. They have more time to instill values, morals, and principles that will guide their child's decisions and actions throughout their life. Moreover, children tend to mirror themselves on their parents, often emulating their behaviors, attitudes, and language. This mirroring effect is a testament to the profound impact parents have on their child's psyche and worldview.The power of parental influence is not limited to explicit teaching, but also extends to implicit modeling. Children learn by observing their parents' actions, tone, and body language, which can either reinforce or undermine the values and lessons being taught. Therefore, it is essential for parents to be mindful of the messages they convey, both verbally and non-verbally, as these can have a lasting impact on their child's self-esteem, confidence, and overall well-being.In conclusion, the things parents say and do have a profound impact on their child's life. As the primary caregivers and role models, parents have a unique responsibility to shape their child's development and provide a nurturing environment that fosters growth, learning, and exploration. By being aware of the power of their words and actions, parents can harness their influence to raise confident, capable, and compassionate individuals who will thrive in all aspects of life.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The development of modern food technology has revolutionized the way we prepare and consume food. With the advancement of industrial food production, meals can be prepared more easily and efficiently than ever before. The use of preservatives, additives, and other chemicals has enabled mass production of food products, making them widely available and affordable. As a result, food can be prepared in a fraction of the time it used to take, and it can also taste a lot better than it used to, with a wider range of flavors and textures available.However, this convenience comes with a caveat. People should be careful with what they eat, as some industrial foods are very bad for their health. The high levels of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats present in many processed foods can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, the use of artificial additives and preservatives has been linked to various health issues, such as allergies and digestive problems. Therefore, it is essential for consumers to be mindful of the ingredients and nutritional content of the food they eat.In conclusion, while the development of modern food technology has made food preparation easier and more convenient, it is crucial for people to be aware of the potential health risks associated with industrial foods. By making informed choices about the food they eat, individuals can enjoy the benefits of modern food technology while also protecting their health. This can be achieved by opting for whole, unprocessed foods, reading food labels carefully, and being cautious of foods that are high in unhealthy ingredients. By being mindful of what we eat, we can ensure that the convenience of modern food technology does not come at the cost of our health.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The debate on whether schools should require students to take regular standardized exams has been ongoing for years. One of the primary arguments in favor of these exams is that they provide a fair and unbiased means of grading students. Standardized tests offer a level playing field, where all students are assessed based on the same criteria, allowing teachers to accurately evaluate their knowledge and understanding of the subject matter.Moreover, many teachers rely heavily on exam results when grading their students. This is because exams provide a comprehensive and objective measure of a student's performance, making it easier for teachers to compare and contrast their students' abilities. By using exam results as a primary grading tool, teachers can ensure that their assessments are fair, consistent, and free from personal biases. This approach is particularly useful in large classrooms where it may be challenging for teachers to get to know each student individually and assess their progress accurately.The use of standardized exams is superior to other assessment methods because it provides a clear and transparent way of evaluating student performance. Unlike other forms of assessment, such as classwork or projects, which can be subjective and influenced by various factors, exams offer a straightforward and quantifiable measure of a student's knowledge and skills. Additionally, exams help teachers to identify areas where students may need extra support or review, allowing them to tailor their instruction to meet the needs of their students. In conclusion, requiring students to take regular standardized exams is a sensible approach, as it enables teachers to fairly and accurately grade their students, and provides a reliable means of assessing student performance.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";In today's world, the cost of education is skyrocketing, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to pursue their academic goals. As a result, many people are opting for self-financed education, where they bear the entire cost of their education. However, the idea of free-of-charge education is a beacon of hope for scholars who are genuinely passionate about learning and willing to put in the effort required to succeed.The rising cost of education is a significant barrier for many individuals, particularly those from low-income backgrounds. Self-financed education, while providing an opportunity for individuals to pursue their academic goals, can lead to a significant financial burden. Many students are forced to take out loans or work part-time jobs to support themselves, which can be stressful and distracting from their studies.On the other hand, the concept of free-of-charge education is a game-changer. It inspires and motivates scholars who are truly dedicated to their studies, as they are able to focus solely on their academic pursuits without the burden of financial worries. Free education allows students to explore their interests and passions without the pressure of having to justify the cost of their education. It also provides an equal opportunity for all individuals to access quality education, regardless of their financial background.Moreover, free education can lead to a more equitable and just society, where individuals are judged on their merit and abilities rather than their financial resources. It can also lead to a more skilled and educated workforce, which can have a positive impact on the economy and society as a whole. In conclusion, while self-financed education may be a necessity for some, the idea of free-of-charge education is a powerful motivator for scholars who are genuinely committed to their studies, and it has the potential to create a more just and equitable society.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of professors in a university is multifaceted, with teaching and research being two of the most critical aspects of their job. While it is undeniable that professors are essentially teachers who play a vital role in educating students, it is equally important to acknowledge the significance of research in their profession. In fact, I firmly believe that professors should allocate more time to conducting research rather than solely focusing on teaching.There are several compelling reasons to support this argument. Firstly, research is essential for advancing knowledge and innovation in various fields, and professors are best positioned to drive this process. By dedicating more time to research, professors can contribute to the discovery of new ideas, theories, and technologies that can have a profound impact on society. This, in turn, can enhance the reputation of the university and attract more talented students and faculty members.Secondly, research experience is invaluable for professors as it enables them to stay updated with the latest developments in their field and incorporate this knowledge into their teaching. This can lead to more engaging and relevant coursework, which can inspire students to pursue their own research interests. Moreover, professors who are actively involved in research can serve as role models and mentors, motivating students to adopt a similar approach to learning and exploration.Lastly, prioritizing research can lead to more collaboration and networking opportunities for professors, which can result in access to more resources, funding, and expertise. This can further amplify the impact of their research and create a positive feedback loop, where research informs teaching, and teaching inspires research. In conclusion, while teaching is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of a professor's role, it is essential to recognize the significance of research and allocate sufficient time to pursue it. By doing so, professors can drive innovation, enhance their teaching, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in their field.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;The impact of television and movies on people's behavior is a widely debated topic. While some argue that these media outlets can have a positive influence, it is undeniable that their negative effects far outweigh the good. The truth is, television and movies often have a detrimental influence on our behavior, shaping our habits and interactions in unhealthy ways.One of the most significant negative effects of television and movies is their promotion of unhealthy eating habits. The constant advertisements and portrayals of junk food in these media outlets encourage people to consume more rubbish food, leading to a rise in obesity and other diet-related health issues. Furthermore, the excessive screen time spent watching television or movies can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, causing individuals to spend less time engaging in physical activities and socializing with friends and family.Moreover, television and movies often present unrealistic and superficial role models, promoting materialism and consumerism. People, especially young viewers, may feel pressured to conform to these idealized images, leading to a loss of individuality and authenticity. They may try to emulate the characters they see on screen, rather than being themselves, resulting in a lack of self-confidence and self-acceptance. This can have long-term effects on mental health and relationships, as people struggle to maintain a sense of identity and belonging.In conclusion, while television and movies can have some positive influences, their negative effects on behavior are more pronounced. They contribute to unhealthy eating habits, social isolation, and a loss of individuality. It is essential for viewers to be aware of these influences and to consume media responsibly, promoting a healthier and more balanced lifestyle. By being mindful of the media's impact, we can mitigate its negative effects and foster a more positive and authentic sense of self.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;Visiting museums is an enriching experience that offers a multitude of benefits. Not only do museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of a place, but they also serve as a platform for socialization. By exploring the various exhibits and displays, the visitor can gain a deeper understanding of the local heritage and traditions. The wealth of knowledge acquired through museum visits enables individuals to participate in conversations with a newfound confidence, armed with fascinating facts and insights.Moreover, museums present a unique opportunity for making friends and establishing relations with like-minded people. As visitors wander through the galleries, they can engage with others who share similar interests, striking up conversations and fostering connections. These interactions can lead to meaningful relationships, both personal and professional. The shared experience of discovering new artifacts and learning about historical events creates a common ground, allowing individuals to bond over their mutual curiosity.The knowledge gained from museum visits can also be applied in various aspects of life, enabling individuals to engage in discussions with a broader perspective. By being well-informed about different cultures and historical events, individuals can navigate social situations with greater ease, contributing to a more harmonious and enlightened community. In conclusion, visiting museums is a rewarding experience that not only expands one's knowledge but also provides a chance to form new connections and participate in conversations with confidence. As such, the importance of museums as a hub for both intellectual and social growth cannot be overstated. By embracing the opportunities that museums offer, individuals can enrich their lives and the lives of those around them.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"The age-old adage that ""a man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues"" still holds true today. A person's mannerisms and behavior towards others can reveal a great deal about their character and values. Those who possess good manners are likely to give others a fine personal impression, A person with good manners is one who is polite, courteous, and respectful towards others. They are able to express themselves in a way that is considerate and thoughtful, making those around them feel valued and appreciated. Politeness and tender words have a profound impact on both the speaker and the listener. Not only do they help the speaker to earn a good reputation and build strong relationships, But they also have the power to encourage and uplift those who are in need. A kind word or a gentle gesture can go a long way in brightening someone's day and boosting their confidence. In times of hardship or struggle, a person with good manners can offer comfort and support through their thoughtful and empathetic demeanor.In conclusion, good manners are essential for building strong relationships and earning the respect and admiration of others. By being polite, courteous, and respectful, we can create a positive and supportive environment that benefits everyone involved. As the saying goes, ""a man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues,"" and it is up to each of us to ensure that our manners reflect the best of our character. By doing so, we can make a lasting and positive impact on those around us and create a more harmonious and compassionate world."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;The notion that difficulties encountered at a young age can become an invaluable fortune in the future is a concept that has garnered significant attention. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, believing that tough experiences in early life can indeed be beneficial in one's life journey.To begin with, hardship has a profound impact on an individual's ability to appreciate the small, yet wonderful things in life. When people face challenges from a young age, they develop a deeper understanding of the value of everyday moments and experiences. This realization fosters a sense of gratitude and contentment, allowing them to cherish the common yet wonderful little things that happen in their lives. As a result, they become more optimistic and resilient, leading to a more fulfilling life.Moreover, individuals who have experienced numerous difficulties tend to remain calm in the face of trouble. Having already overcome significant obstacles, they possess a heightened sense of awareness and confidence in their ability to navigate challenges. This composure enables them to approach problems with a clear and level head, making more informed decisions and finding solutions more efficiently. Their past experiences serve as a foundation for their future, providing them with the strength and perseverance needed to overcome any obstacle that comes their way.In conclusion, the difficulties people encounter at a young age can indeed become a valuable asset in their future lives. By teaching individuals to appreciate the small things and remain calm in the face of adversity, these challenges lay the groundwork for a stronger, more resilient person. As such, I firmly believe that the tough experiences people meet before will ultimately be helpful in their life path, shaping them into capable and determined individuals.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The debate about the advantages of living in the city versus the countryside has been ongoing for years. While both options have their pros and cons, the city seems to offer a more attractive and convenient lifestyle. One of the main advantages of living in the city is the better education system and more work opportunities. Cities are typically home to prestigious universities and a wide range of industries, providing citizens with access to quality education and employment.Another benefit of urban living is the cultural diversity that comes with a large and populous city. With more citizens from various backgrounds, cities offer a unique blend of cultures, making them a melting pot of traditions, customs, and ways of life. This diversity is reflected in the city's cuisine, festivals, and art, making it a fascinating place to live and experience. Furthermore, cities have a well-developed transportation system, with frequent buses and trains, making it easy to get around and communicate with others.On the other hand, the countryside has its own charm and advantages. One of the most significant benefits of rural living is the abundance of peaceful and serene locations, perfect for rest and relaxation. The countryside's natural beauty, rolling hills, and quiet atmosphere make it an ideal destination for those seeking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. However, when weighing the pros and cons, the city's advantages in terms of education, job opportunities, cultural diversity, and communication seem to outweigh the benefits of rural living. Overall, the city provides a more dynamic and convenient lifestyle, making it a more attractive option for those seeking to advance their careers, experience new cultures, and enjoy a faster pace of life.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;As the world's economy continues to grow, people are becoming increasingly wealthy. With their basic needs met, they are now focusing on fulfilling their mental requirements, such as the pursuit of happiness. While some individuals may find happiness in their jobs, I firmly believe that a person's living environment plays a more significant role in determining their overall happiness.For many people, their job is just a means to a paycheck, and it may not necessarily bring them joy or fulfillment. On the other hand, a person's living environment has a profound impact on their daily life and overall well-being. A comfortable, safe, and beautiful living space can greatly contribute to one's happiness and sense of satisfaction. The quality of air, access to green spaces, and proximity to amenities such as parks, schools, and healthcare facilities are just a few examples of how a living environment can shape a person's happiness.Moreover, a person's living environment can also influence their mental health, social connections, and overall quality of life. For instance, a living environment that is polluted, noisy, or crowded can lead to increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression. In contrast, a peaceful, natural, and vibrant living environment can foster a sense of calmness, creativity, and community, ultimately leading to greater happiness. Therefore, while a job may provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment for some, I believe that a person's living environment is more crucial in determining their overall happiness and well-being. As people continue to prioritize their mental requirements, it is essential to recognize the significance of living environment in achieving happiness and a better quality of life.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a multitude of options for staying in touch with others. Gone are the days of relying solely on traditional face-to-face interactions. Nowadays, we have a plethora of choices, including voice mail, e-mail, telephone, and of course, the classic in-person conversation. Among these options, I firmly believe that email stands out as the most preferable method of communication, and for good reason.First and foremost, email offers unparalleled convenience. With the ability to send and receive messages at any time and from any location, email accommodates even the most hectic of schedules. Unlike traditional face-to-face conversations or even phone calls, which demand immediate attention and can be intrusive, email allows the recipient to respond at their leisure. This flexibility is invaluable in today's fast-paced world.Another significant advantage of email is that it facilitates honest expression. When communicating through email, individuals have the time to gather their thoughts, reflect on their feelings, and articulate their messages with clarity and precision. This often leads to more sincere and thoughtful interactions, as opposed to the potential for miscommunication that can occur in the spontaneity of face-to-face conversations or over the phone.Lastly, email enables fluency in communicating, especially across different languages and geographical boundaries. With the aid of translation tools and the lack of real-time pressure, email breaks down barriers that might otherwise hinder effective communication. It allows for the exchange of ideas, sentiments, and information in a clear, composed manner, fostering deeper understanding and connection among individuals.In conclusion, while the traditional face-to-face method will always hold a special place in human interaction, the benefits of email, including its convenience, the honesty it encourages, and the fluency it provides, make it my preferred mode of communication in today's tech-driven world. Whether for personal, academic, or professional purposes, email has proven to be a reliable, efficient, and effective means of staying connected.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";The advent of television has brought about a myriad of effects on individuals and society as a whole. While it may have its advantages, such as providing entertainment and information, the negatives associated with it far outweigh the positives. One of the most significant drawbacks of television is its tendency to discourage face-to-face conversation among people.In today's world, it is not uncommon to find families or friends gathered in the same room, yet each individual is glued to the screen, oblivious to the presence of others. This phenomenon has led to a decline in meaningful conversations and interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining relationships. As people spend more time watching television, they tend to neglect the importance of engaging with one another, leading to a sense of isolation and disconnection.Furthermore, television shows often distract people from what is truly important in life. With the constant stream of programs and advertisements, individuals can easily become sidetracked from their priorities and goals. The glamorization of material possessions and unrealistic lifestyles portrayed on television can also create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism. As a result, people may find themselves striving for things that do not truly matter, rather than focusing on personal growth, relationships, and contributions to society.Moreover, individuals who have favorite programs often become obsessed with them, particularly when they are on air. This obsession can lead to an unhealthy attachment, causing people to prioritize watching television over other important aspects of their lives, such as work, study, or spending time with loved ones. The constant need to keep up with the latest episodes can also create stress and anxiety, as individuals feel pressured to stay current with their favorite shows. In conclusion, while television may have its benefits, its negative effects on human interaction, priorities, and obsession cannot be ignored. It is essential to maintain a balance between watching television and engaging in other aspects of life to ensure a healthy and well-rounded lifestyle.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, and various methods have emerged as a result. While many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, I firmly believe that communicating via emails or voice mails is superior. This stance is grounded in several compelling reasons, which I will outline in this essay.First and foremost, email and voice mail communication is remarkably easy and convenient. For individuals who struggle with the prospect of calling someone they are not familiar with, it can be daunting. In such scenarios, writing a voice mail or email is significantly less intimidating. This ease of communication facilitates smoother interactions, especially in professional or formal contexts where one might not have a prior relationship with the recipient.Another significant advantage of email and voice mail is the flexibility they offer in terms of timing. Unlike telephone calls or face-to-face meetings, which require both parties to be available at the same time, it is possible to compose and send an email at any hour of the day. This aspect is particularly beneficial for individuals with busy schedules or those who operate in different time zones. As for me, it provides the opportunity to gather my thoughts and articulate them clearly before sending a message, which often leads to more effective and clear communication.In conclusion, the benefits of communicating through emails or voice mails, including ease and flexibility, make them a preferable method of communication in today's fast-paced world. They cater to a wide range of communication needs, from personal to professional, and offer a convenient and efficient way to stay connected.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The old adage ""haste makes waste"" rings true in the context of decision-making. Every fast and not well-thought-out decision is indeed a wasted one, as it often leads to probable bad results. Making quick decisions without careful consideration can have far-reaching and devastating consequences. Hurried decisions, made in the heat of the moment, can not only go to waste but also affect the entire life of the person making them.When we rush into decisions without weighing the pros and cons, we increase the likelihood of errors and mistakes. This is because our minds are not fully engaged, and we may overlook crucial details or alternative perspectives. As a result, we may end up with outcomes that are contrary to our goals and aspirations. Furthermore, the consequences of such decisions can be long-lasting, influencing not only our immediate circumstances but also our future prospects.The repercussions of impulsive decisions can be severe, impacting various aspects of our lives, including our relationships, careers, and overall well-being. For instance, a hasty decision to quit a job or end a relationship can lead to financial instability, emotional distress, and a loss of social connections. Similarly, a rushed decision to invest in a business or financial venture can result in significant financial losses, damaging our credit score and reputation.In conclusion, it is essential to approach decision-making with caution and deliberation. Taking the time to reflect on our choices, seeking advice from others, and considering multiple perspectives can help us make informed and thoughtful decisions. By doing so, we can avoid the pitfalls of hasty decisions and create a more secure and prosperous future for ourselves. As the saying goes, ""patience is a virtue,"" and in the context of decision-making, it is a virtue that can save us from the waste and regret that often accompanies hurried and ill-conceived choices."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile is undoubtedly one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Its impact on modern society is immense, and its importance cannot be overstated. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how integral they are to our daily routines. The convenience and flexibility that cars provide have made them an essential part of our lives, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.The automobile has revolutionized the way we travel, allowing people to move freely and easily from one place to another. This has enabled people to travel more often, exploring new destinations and experiencing different cultures. As a result, people are able to broaden their horizons, get to know the world, and develop a deeper understanding of the diversity and complexity of human societies. Whether it's a road trip across the country or a short drive to a nearby city, the automobile has made it possible for people to explore and discover new places, fostering a sense of adventure and curiosity.Moreover, the automobile has also had a significant impact on the economy and social structures. It has enabled people to commute to work, access goods and services, and connect with others, thereby facilitating economic growth and social interaction. The automobile has also created new industries and job opportunities, contributing to the overall development of societies. In conclusion, the automobile is a vital part of modern life, and its significance extends far beyond its functional purpose as a mode of transportation. It has transformed the way we live, work, and interact with each other, and its importance will only continue to grow in the future.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;"The age-old adage ""like father, like son"" takes on a new meaning when it comes to choosing a career path. Opting for a job similar to that of one's parents can have a profound impact on one's professional journey. By following in their parents' footsteps, individuals can leverage the wealth of knowledge and experience that their parents have accumulated over the years. As parents are already familiar with the industry and its intricacies, they can offer invaluable guidance and support to their children, helping them navigate the complexities of the job market.One of the primary advantages of choosing a job similar to one's parents' is the domain knowledge and industry-related information that they can provide. Having spent years working in the same field, parents have a deep understanding of the industry's nuances, challenges, and opportunities. They can share their expertise with their children, providing them with a competitive edge in the job market. Moreover, parents can also offer valuable insights into the company culture, professional etiquette, and best practices, all of which are essential for success in any profession.Some may argue that the job market has undergone significant changes over time, and therefore, parents' experience may not be directly applicable to their children's career. However, I firmly believe that parents can still play a vital role in guiding their children towards a smooth career path. While the job market may have evolved, the fundamental principles of professionalism, hard work, and dedication remain unchanged. Parents can impart these timeless values to their children, helping them develop a strong foundation for their professional journey. Furthermore, parents can also help their children build a network of contacts and connections within the industry, which can be invaluable in securing job opportunities and advancing in their careers. In conclusion, choosing a job similar to one's parents' can be a wise decision, as it allows individuals to tap into their parents' wealth of knowledge and experience, setting them up for success in their chosen career path."
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The salaries of professional athletes and entertainers have long been a subject of fascination and debate. It is not uncommon for these individuals to earn millions of dollars, a sum that is hard to imagine for the average person. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, from my perspective, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.Firstly, a worker's salary can properly reflect his or her competence. Professional athletes and entertainers possess exceptional skills and talents that are honed through years of dedication and hard work. Their unique abilities set them apart from others, and their salaries are a reflection of their value in the industry. Just like any other profession, where individuals with specialized skills and expertise are compensated accordingly, athletes and entertainers should also be paid based on their exceptional abilities.Secondly, such high salaries can guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. The pressure to perform at the highest level is immense, and the financial rewards can serve as a motivator to push them to excel. With high salaries, athletes and entertainers can focus solely on their craft, without worrying about financial stability, allowing them to deliver outstanding performances that entertain and inspire millions of people worldwide. Moreover, these high salaries also incentivize them to maintain a high level of physical fitness, to continuously improve their skills, and to be role models for their fans.In conclusion, while the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers may seem excessive to some, I firmly believe that they deserve their high payments. Their unique talents, exceptional skills, and the value they bring to the industry justify their salaries. Moreover, these high payments are essential in guaranteeing and supporting their great performances, which bring joy and entertainment to millions of people around the world.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;The Importance of Music and Art in Childhood DevelopmentWhen it comes to a child's education, parents often prioritize core subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. However, the arts, including music and visual art, are also essential components of a well-rounded education. In fact, music and art are usually at the top of the must-learn list for many parents. I firmly believe that this is a wise decision, as these creative pursuits are crucial for developing a child's senses and fostering a lifelong appreciation for beauty and self-expression.In my opinion, it is highly suitable for children to develop their senses through music and art when they are young. These creative activities stimulate a child's imagination, cognitive skills, and emotional intelligence, laying the foundation for a lifelong journey of discovery and exploration. By introducing music and art at a young age, children can develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and critical thinking abilities. Moreover, these activities provide a platform for children to express themselves,, which is essential for building confidence, creativity, and individuality.Investing in music and art education is a worthwhile endeavor, as it can have a profound impact on a child's personality and character. These creative pursuits can nourish a child's temperament, teaching them valuable lessons about perseverance, discipline, and self-expression. By cultivating a love for music and art, children can develop a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, leading to a more empathetic, open-minded, and well-rounded individual. In conclusion, music and art are essential components of a child's education, and parents should prioritize these creative pursuits to give their children the best possible start in life.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;The age-old problem of disengaged students has long plagued the education system. Many students view school subjects as mere academic exercises, devoid of practical relevance to their lives. However, in my opinion, the best way for teachers to pique students' interest in a subject is to illustrate its real-world applications and relevance to their daily lives. By doing so, teachers can make the subject more relatable, accessible, and ultimately, more engaging.When students are shown how a particular subject contributes to their everyday lives, they are more likely to develop a deeper appreciation and understanding of its significance. This approach not only makes the subject more interesting but also helps students to see the value and purpose of learning. For instance, a math teacher can explain how mathematical concepts are used in cooking, finance, or architecture, making the subject more tangible and applicable. Similarly, a science teacher can demonstrate how scientific principles are used in medical treatments, transportation, or environmental conservation, highlighting the subject's relevance to students' lives.By explaining the practical applications of a subject, students are likely to form a vivid impression of its importance and become more active in acquiring knowledge. They will begin to see the connections between the subject matter and their own experiences, sparking their curiosity and motivating them to learn more. As a result, students will become more engaged, participatory, and enthusiastic about learning, leading to a more effective and enjoyable educational experience. Ultimately, teachers who can make their subject relevant and applicable to students' lives will be rewarded with a more attentive, interested, and motivated classroom, where learning is a collaborative and rewarding experience for all.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;The 21st century is plagued by two of the most pressing issues: environmental protection and economic development. Both are crucial to the future and welfare of humanity, making them a subject of great importance and debate. While some argue that economic development should take precedence, I firmly believe that addressing environmental problems should be the top priority.Environmental protection is essential for the very survival of our planet. The alarming rates of pollution, deforestation, and climate change pose a significant threat to the health and well-being of humans and wildlife alike. If left unaddressed, these issues will have catastrophic consequences, including the loss of biodiversity, erratic weather patterns, and scarcity of natural resources. The future of our planet and its inhabitants depends on our ability to mitigate these environmental problems.On the other hand, economic development is vital for improving the standard of living and reducing poverty. However, I believe that environmental protection should take precedence over economic development. A healthy environment is the foundation upon which economic growth can be sustained. Without a stable and thriving ecosystem, economic development will be short-lived and ultimately, futile. In fact, studies have shown that investing in environmental protection can actually stimulate economic growth and create new job opportunities.In conclusion, while both environmental protection and economic development are important, I strongly believe that tackling environmental problems should be our first priority. The long-term benefits of a healthy environment far outweigh the short-term gains of economic development. It is our responsibility to ensure that our actions today do not compromise the future of our planet and its inhabitants. By prioritizing environmental protection, we can create a sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;The rise in environmental concerns has sparked a debate about the future of car usage. On one hand, some individuals believe that the growing awareness of environmental issues will lead to a decrease in car use. On the other hand, others argue that having a personal car is essential for daily life and will continue to be a necessity. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the notion that car use will decrease in the future.With the increasing concern about climate change, air pollution, and other environmental issues, it is likely that people will start to opt for alternative modes of transportation. Governments and companies are already investing in eco-friendly options such as electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as improving public transportation systems. As these alternatives become more accessible and affordable, people will be more inclined to leave their cars behind. Furthermore, the rise of car-sharing and ride-hailing services is also expected to reduce the need for personal car ownership.In addition, the environmental benefits of reducing car use are undeniable. With fewer cars on the road, there will be a significant decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion. This, in turn, will lead to a healthier and more sustainable environment. While some may argue that personal cars are essential for daily life, I believe that with the advancement of technology and the improvement of public transportation, this need will diminish.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the use of cars will decrease in the future. As environmental concerns continue to rise, people will be more inclined to opt for alternative modes of transportation. With the advancement of technology and the improvement of public transportation, the need for personal car ownership will diminish, leading to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;The university experience is often characterized by a significant amount of independence, allowing students to take charge of their own learning. While this freedom can be liberating, it also poses a challenge for many students. Some individuals may feel that attending classes is unnecessary as long as they can prepare for and pass exams on their own. However, this mindset overlooks the importance of classroom attendance in the learning process.Attending classes is a crucial aspect of university education, offering numerous benefits that solo studying cannot replicate. In a classroom setting, students are exposed to diverse perspectives, engage in discussions, and receive immediate feedback from instructors. These interactions facilitate a deeper understanding of complex concepts, as students can ask questions, clarify doubts, and learn from one another. Furthermore, classes provide students with the opportunity to develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.In contrast, studying alone can lead to a superficial grasp of course material, as students may miss out on the nuanced discussions and explanations that occur in a classroom. Without the structure and guidance provided by instructors, students may also struggle to stay motivated and on track with their coursework. Therefore, attending classes is a more effective way to learn and absorb information, as it combines individual study with collaborative learning and expert instruction.Ultimately, attending classes is a basic responsibility of university students. By attending classes, students demonstrate their commitment to their education and their willingness to engage with the course material. It is not solely about passing exams, but about embracing the opportunities that university education provides. By recognizing the value of classroom attendance, students can make the most of their university experience and set themselves up for success in their academic and professional pursuits.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;The Role of Luck in Achieving SuccessThe concept of luck playing a significant role in achieving success is a widely debated topic. Some people believe that luck is the primary cause of success, while others attribute it to hard work and dedication. To be frank, I cannot agree with the notion that luck is the main driving force behind success. In my opinion, diligence and perseverance are the key factors that contribute to achieving success.To begin with, famous and successful people are usually diligent individuals who have put in countless hours of effort to reach their goals. They are not merely lucky people who have stumbled upon success. The likes of Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs are prime examples of individuals who achieved greatness through their relentless pursuit of innovation and perfection. Their success can be attributed to their hard work, passion, and commitment to their craft, rather than mere luck.Besides, relying solely on luck to achieve success is an unreliable and unsustainable approach. Luck is unpredictable and can change at any moment, and those who depend on it may find themselves disappointed and unprepared when it runs out. On the other hand, developing a strong work ethic and persevering through challenges can guarantee a higher chance of success. By being diligent and persistent, individuals can create their own opportunities and pave their own path to success, rather than waiting for luck to strike. In conclusion, while luck may play a minor role in achieving success, it is ultimately the result of hard work, dedication, and perseverance that leads to greatness.
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The age-old debate about the most effective way to learn has sparked a significant amount of discussion. While some argue that learning on one's own is the way to go, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher can prevent confusion and increase the rate and speed of learning. When guided by an experienced instructor, the learning process becomes more streamlined and efficient. A good teacher can help clarify complex concepts, provide personalized feedback, and offer valuable insights that might be overlooked when learning independently.With a teacher, the risk of confusion is significantly minimized. They can identify areas where students are struggling and provide targeted support, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. Moreover, a teacher can help learners stay focused and motivated, which is essential for maintaining a steady pace and achieving academic goals. The guidance and structure provided by a teacher enable students to learn faster and easier, as they are exposed to a wealth of knowledge and expertise that might be difficult to access on their own.That being said, there are times when I prefer to learn on my own. Self-directed learning allows for flexibility and autonomy, enabling me to explore topics at my own pace and delve deeper into areas that interest me. However, when it comes to complex or unfamiliar subjects, I recognize the value of having a knowledgeable teacher to guide me. An experienced teacher can facilitate my learning, provide valuable resources, and help me navigate challenging concepts with ease. Ultimately, the combination of teacher-guided learning and independent study strikes a perfect balance, allowing me to reap the benefits of both approaches and achieve academic success. By leveraging the strengths of both methods, I can maximize my learning potential and make the most of my educational journey.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The advancement in technology has made it possible for people to work from anywhere, as long as they have the necessary equipment with them. This has led to a rise in remote work, with many individuals opting to work from the comfort of their own homes. However, in my opinion, working from home is not as efficient as working in an office setting.While working from home may seem like a convenient and comfortable option, it has its downsides. One of the major drawbacks is that individuals who work from home are more likely to miss out on important events and announcements that take place in the office. For instance, important announcements from the boss or team meetings may be missed, which can lead to a sense of disconnection from the rest of the team. This can ultimately affect an individual's productivity and performance, as they may not be aware of important updates or changes.Additionally, working from home can also lead to distractions and lack of motivation. Without a structured work environment, it can be easy to get sidetracked by personal activities or responsibilities, leading to a decrease in productivity. In contrast, working in an office setting provides a structured and focused environment, where individuals can stay motivated and engaged with their work. Furthermore, offices provide opportunities for face-to-face interactions and collaborations, which are essential for creativity, innovation, and problem-solving.In conclusion, while working from anywhere is possible with the right equipment, I believe that working in an office setting is more efficient and effective than working from home. The structure, interactions, and access to important events and announcements make offices a more conducive environment for productivity and success.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;In today's world, conformity is often encouraged, and individuals are pressured to blend in with the crowd. However, being different from everyone else is a trait that should be celebrated, as it often signifies that one has achieved something superior to others. When an individual dares to be unique, they are, in fact, creating their own path to success. This uniqueness can lead to the creation of their own value, which is an asset that can never be taken away by others.A prime example of this concept is Apple, one of the most popular and prestigious technology companies in the world. Apple's success can be attributed to its willingness to think differently and challenge the status quo. When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded the company, they didn't try to replicate existing products, but instead, they innovated and created something entirely new. The result was a line of products that revolutionized the tech industry, from the Macintosh computer to the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Apple's uniqueness and commitment to innovation have made it a leader in the tech world, with a brand value that is unparalleled.Apple's ability to create its own value is a testament to the power of being different. The company's products are not just functional, but also beautiful and sleek, reflecting the unique design aesthetic that Jobs and his team brought to the table. This unique value proposition has created a loyal customer base, with many customers willing to pay a premium for Apple's products. In conclusion, being different from everyone else is not something to be ashamed of, but rather something to be proud of. It is a sign of innovation, creativity, and a willingness to take risks. As Apple has shown, embracing uniqueness can lead to the creation of something truly remarkable, and a value that can never be replicated or taken away.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;The challenges faced by the current generation are vastly different from those encountered by the previous generation. One of the primary differences lies in the work-related challenges that have arisen as a result of globalization and industrial integration. In today's interconnected world, the job market has become increasingly complex and competitive. With the advent of technological advancements and the erosion of geographical boundaries, the modern workforce is expected to be adaptable, flexible, and skilled in a multitude of areas. This has led to a significant increase in stress and pressure on individuals to perform and deliver results in a rapidly changing environment.Furthermore, this generation is also grappling with the issue of self-recognition, which was not as prevalent in the past. The proliferation of social media has created unrealistic expectations and a culture of comparison, where individuals feel compelled to present a curated version of themselves to the world. This has led to a crisis of identity, with many young people struggling to define themselves and find their place in the world. The constant bombardment of information and the pressure to conform to societal norms has resulted in a generation that is uncertain, anxious, and questioning of their own self-worth.In contrast, the previous generation faced different challenges, such as economic instability, limited access to education, and social inequality. While these challenges were significant, they were more tangible and easier to address. The challenges faced by the current generation, on the other hand, are more nuanced and complex, requiring a deeper understanding of the human psyche and the impact of technology on society. As such, it is essential to acknowledge and address these challenges, providing support and guidance to help this generation navigate the complexities of the modern world. By doing so, we can empower them to overcome their struggles and reach their full potential.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"The concept of success has been debated by many, with various viewpoints emerging on the key characteristics that define successful individuals. In my opinion, one of the primary reasons that contribute to the success of a person is their willingness to try new things and take risks. This mindset allows them to learn valuable lessons and gain unique insights that can propel them towards their goals.Trying new things is an essential aspect of success, as it enables individuals to step out of their comfort zones and explore uncharted territories. By doing so, they can discover new strengths, weaknesses, and passions, which can help them refine their approach and make informed decisions. Moreover, taking risks is a crucial element of success, as it allows individuals to challenge the status quo, push boundaries, and innovate. Great success often requires great risks, and those who are willing to take the leap of faith are more likely to achieve their objectives.The ability to learn from failures and setbacks is also a vital trait of successful people. When individuals try new things and take risks, they inevitably encounter obstacles and failures. However, it is their response to these setbacks that sets them apart. Successful people use failures as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than becoming discouraged and giving up. By embracing a growth mindset, they can distill valuable lessons from their experiences and apply them to future endeavors.In conclusion, the willingness to try new things and take risks is a key characteristic of successful people. By embracing this mindset, individuals can learn valuable lessons, gain unique insights, and develop the resilience needed to overcome obstacles and achieve great success. As the old adage goes, ""nothing ventured, nothing gained,"" and it is those who are willing to take the risk and try new things that are most likely to reap the rewards of success."
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;The path to success in a future job is often multifaceted, requiring a combination of skills and personal qualities. In my opinion, the two pivotal elements that contribute significantly to professional success are the ability to relate well to people and diligent academic effort. However, these are not the only factors, as effective communication also plays a crucial role. Relating well to people is fundamental because it fosters a strong foundation for personal and professional relationships. By being adept at interpersonal connections, we are more likely to build a wide network of contacts. This network can serve as a valuable resource, offering support, advice, and opportunities that can significantly enhance our career progression. Furthermore, effective communication is intertwined with this ability, as it enables us to clearly express our thoughts, engage in meaningful discussions, and negotiate our ideas with others. Studying hard in school is equally important as it provides us with the necessary knowledge and skills required for our chosen profession. Academic achievements not only equip us with a solid understanding of our field but also demonstrate our commitment, discipline, and intellectual capacity. These attributes are highly valued by employers and can set us apart as strong candidates in a competitive job market.In conclusion, success in a future job is contingent upon a blend of personal and academic abilities. Relating well to people, studying hard, and effective communication are all essential components that can propel us towards achieving our professional goals. By focusing on these aspects, we can build a strong foundation for our careers, ensuring that we are well-equipped to navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Ultimately, embracing these qualities will enable us to reach our full potential and make meaningful contributions in our chosen fields.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The proliferation of advertising in modern society has led to a significant influence on people's choices, ranging from consumer goods to dietary habits. As a result, there is a growing concern that advertising is a primary driver of unhealthy eating habits. However, I disagree with this notion. In my opinion, advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits. Instead, the key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in the concept of wholesome diets and self-control.While it is true that advertisements for unhealthy foods are ubiquitous, individuals have the ultimate power to make informed choices about what they eat. A wholesome diet, one that is balanced and nutritious, is the cornerstone of healthy eating. This, combined with self-control, enables individuals to resist the allure of unhealthy foods, even when they are heavily advertised. Moreover, education and awareness about the importance of a balanced diet play a crucial role in shaping eating habits, and these cannot be solely attributed to the influence of advertising.Interestingly, advertising might also play a role in promoting healthier eating habits. With the growing awareness of the importance of living a better lifestyle, there is an increasing demand for healthier food options. Advertisements for nutritious foods, fitness programs, and wellness services are becoming more prevalent, reflecting and contributing to this shift towards healthier choices. By promoting the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, advertising can inspire individuals to make positive changes to their diet and exercise habits.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly influences our choices, it is not the primary cause of unhealthy eating habits. The responsibility for maintaining a healthy diet lies with the individual, through the adoption of wholesome eating patterns and the exercise of self-control. As society continues to evolve, with a greater emphasis on wellness and healthy living, advertising can actually serve as a positive force, guiding people towards better lifestyle choices.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";The advent of television has revolutionized the way we learn, entertain, and stay informed about current events. With its vast array of programs, television offers something for everyone, catering to diverse interests and age groups. Educational programs, documentaries, and news broadcasts provide valuable insights into various subjects, making television a great tool for learning and staying updated on global happenings.Moreover, television serves as an excellent medium for entertainment, offering a wide range of genres such as comedy, drama, and action. It provides an escape from the daily grind, allowing viewers to relax and unwind. Furthermore, television plays a crucial role in keeping us informed about local and international news, enabling us to stay connected with the world.However, excessive television viewing has some negative effects on certain individuals. Some people spend a significant amount of time watching television, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. This can result in a range of health problems, including obesity and other related diseases. Moreover, the habit of eating while watching television can lead to mindless consumption of food, contributing to unhealthy eating habits and weight gain.In addition, excessive television viewing can also lead to social isolation, as individuals spend more time alone in front of the screen and less time interacting with family and friends. This can have detrimental effects on mental health, leading to depression and anxiety. Therefore, while television is a valuable resource for learning, entertainment, and information, it is essential to maintain a balance and not let it dominate our lives. By being mindful of our viewing habits and ensuring that television is used in moderation, we can harness its benefits while minimizing its negative effects.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The university student body can be broadly categorized into two distinct groups: those with a lackluster attitude towards academics and the diligent, hardworking students. While both types of students have their own priorities and interests, it is undeniable that adopting a healthy lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being. Engaging in physical exercise for at least 30 minutes daily is widely recognized as a fundamental component of a happy and healthy life.However, when it comes to the allocation of university resources, the question arises as to whether equal emphasis should be placed on academic facilities and physical or social activities. In my opinion, the answer is no. Academic institutions are primarily established to provide students with a comprehensive education, and as such, their primary focus should be on academic development. Libraries and laboratories are essential resources that facilitate learning and intellectual growth, and it is only logical that they receive a significant share of the university's budget.In contrast, while physical and social activities are undoubtedly important for a student's overall development, they can be adequately catered for with a smaller allocation of resources. This is not to say that these activities are not valuable, but rather that they should be prioritized secondary to academic pursuits. By placing a greater emphasis on academic facilities, universities can ensure that their students are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in their chosen fields. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the diverse needs of students is necessary, but academic development should remain the primary focus of university resource allocation.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;Attending classes is a cornerstone of the educational experience, offering students a myriad of benefits and learning opportunities. Despite the rise of alternative learning methods, many still believe that physical presence in classes is the wisest option. This perspective is grounded in several key advantages that enhance the learning process.Firstly, being present in class provides students with the invaluable opportunity to interact with their peers. This social aspect of learning is crucial for grasping new concepts, as discussions and reviews with classmates during free periods can significantly clarify complex material. The exchange of ideas and insights among students fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter, making learning a more engaging and effective process.Moreover, students who attend classes can leverage the collective knowledge and expertise of their peers and instructors to overcome difficult concepts. The inability to tap into this communal knowledge base can hinder a student's ability to fully comprehend challenging problems. In a classroom setting, students can readily seek help from their teachers or classmates, facilitating a more comprehensive learning experience.Lastly, attending classes plays a pivotal role in making students more accountable and disciplined. Regular attendance encourages students to stay on top of their assignments and readings, ensuring they are well-prepared for exams and projects. This discipline spills over into other areas of academic life, contributing to overall academic success. In conclusion, while alternative learning options exist, the benefits of attending classes, including peer interaction, access to collective knowledge, and the promotion of discipline, underscore the wisdom of prioritizing classroom attendance for a well-rounded educational experience.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;The advent of modern communication tools, such as telephones and email, has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. In my opinion, communication between people using these tools has made my life easier, and for good reason. Firstly, telephones and email have enabled me to talk or write directly to the people I want to connect with, regardless of their geographical location. This has been particularly useful in both my personal and professional life, allowing me to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, as well as communicate effectively with colleagues and clients. With just a few clicks or a phone call, I can reach out to anyone I need to, and this has saved me a significant amount of time and effort.Secondly, I find that these tools allow me to express certain important thoughts or ideas better than face-to-face communication. Sometimes, putting my thoughts into words can be a daunting task, especially when discussing sensitive or complex topics. Email, in particular, gives me the time and space to carefully craft my messages, ensuring that my point comes across clearly and effectively. Additionally, telephones enable me to convey tone and emotion through voice, which can often get lost in written communication. This flexibility in communication has greatly improved my relationships and interactions, as I can choose the medium that best suits the situation and the person I am communicating with.In conclusion, the use of telephones and email has undoubtedly made my life easier by providing me with the means to connect directly with others and express myself more effectively. These tools have become an integral part of my daily life, allowing me to navigate personal and professional relationships with greater ease and clarity. As technology continues to evolve, I look forward to seeing how future innovations will further enhance our ability to communicate with each other.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;The allure of big cities has long been a topic of discussion, with many arguing that the benefits of urban living far outweigh those of smaller towns. One of the primary advantages of living in a large city is the abundance of social venues available. Restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, and theaters are just a few examples of the many options city dwellers have to socialize and entertain themselves. In contrast, people living in small towns often have limited choices, with perhaps only one bar or one cinema to choose from. This lack of options can make socializing and finding entertainment a challenging and monotonous experience.Another significant benefit of living in a large city is access to advanced medical technologies. Cities are often home to state-of-the-art hospitals and research facilities, providing residents with the latest treatments and medical advancements. This can be a lifesaving advantage, particularly for those with serious or rare medical conditions. In my opinion, the benefits of having access to cutting-edge medical technologies far outweigh the potential drawbacks of city living, such as noise, crowds, and pollution.While some may argue that the fast-paced and often stressful environment of city living can have negative effects on mental and physical health, I firmly believe that the advantages of urban living, particularly in terms of social and medical opportunities, make it a preferable choice. The ability to socialize and connect with others, combined with access to top-notch medical care, makes city living a more desirable and sustainable option for many people. Overall, the benefits of big city living, including its many social and medical advantages, make it an attractive choice for those seeking a vibrant and dynamic lifestyle.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;The Pursuit of Excellence: Focusing on StrengthsIn today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the idea of trying new things and taking risks. While it's admirable to step out of our comfort zones, it's equally important to recognize and focus on our strengths. Many of us love to try new things, even if we aren't particularly good at them. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that our true potential lies in honing our existing skills and talents.By concentrating on what we do well, we increase our chances of achieving greatness. The more time we spend on activities that play to our strengths, the more likely we are to excel and make a meaningful impact. This is because our strengths are often the areas where we have a natural inclination and aptitude, allowing us to learn and improve at an accelerated rate. When we focus on our strengths, we build momentum, confidence, and expertise, all of which are essential for attaining our goals.In contrast, trying to master something we're not naturally inclined towards can lead to frustration, disappointment, and a sense of mediocrity. While it's important to be well-rounded and open to new experiences, it's equally vital to prioritize our strengths and allocate our time and energy accordingly. By doing so, we'll be more productive, efficient, and effective in our pursuit of excellence. Ultimately, focusing on what we do well is the key to unlocking our full potential and achieving something truly great. By embracing our strengths and dedicating ourselves to their development, we'll be well on our way to realizing our aspirations and making a lasting impact.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;The debate about when to teach children financial responsibility has sparked intense discussion among parents and educators. While some argue that financial literacy should be introduced in adulthood,,assistant,I strongly believe that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. This approach has numerous benefits that can shape their financial habits and decision-making skills for the better. Firstly, teaching children about money management at a young age helps them develop a sense of responsibility and independence. By giving them a weekly or monthly allowance, they learn to prioritize their spending, make smart financial decisions, and understand the value of saving. This foundation is crucial for making informed financial choices in the future.Moreover, introducing financial literacy at a young age helps children understand the consequences of overspending and the importance of budgeting. It enables them to differentiate between needs and wants, making them more mindful of their purchases. Additionally, learning about money management early on helps children develop healthy financial habits, such as saving for long-term goals and avoiding debt. This, in turn, can lead to a more secure and stable financial future.Another significant advantage of teaching financial responsibility at a young age is that it prepares them for real-life scenarios. As they grow older, they will be faced with financial decisions, such as saving for college, managing student loans, or entering the workforce. By learning about money management early on, they will be better equipped to navigate these challenges and make informed decisions. In conclusion, teaching children to manage their own money at a young age is essential for their financial well-being and future success. It helps them develop a sense of responsibility, healthy financial habits, and prepares them for real-life financial scenarios, ultimately setting them up for a more secure and stable financial future.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture.

The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;Dancing is a universal language that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries. In every country, people dance for various reasons, including for fun, entertainment, and to decrease stress. Dancing is not only a form of physical expression, but it is also an integral part of a culture's identity. It represents the values, beliefs, and traditions of a community, showcasing their unique perspective and way of life.Dancing is a significant aspect of cultural heritage, as it often reflects the history, mythology, and spirituality of a nation.

276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;The age-old debate about the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus learning facts has sparked intense discussion among educators and scholars. While some argue that grasping abstract concepts is crucial for students, I firmly believe that acquiring factual knowledge has more profound benefits for their future lives. In my opinion, learning facts is essential for students as it prepares them for the challenges they will face in their personal and professional lives.Firstly, when students learn facts in school, they develop a solid foundation to tackle real-life problems. By acquiring a wealth of factual knowledge, students can apply it to practical situations, making them more resourceful and self-sufficient. For instance, knowing historical dates, scientific formulas, or literary works can help students analyze and understand complex issues, enabling them to make informed decisions. This, in turn, enhances their critical thinking skills, making them more adept at navigating the complexities of everyday life.Secondly, learning facts can significantly improve students' social behavior. When students are well-versed in various subjects, they become more confident and articulate in their interactions with others. This, in turn, fosters better communication skills, empathy, and understanding towards people from diverse backgrounds. Moreover, having a broad knowledge base allows students to engage in meaningful conversations, participate in discussions, and build stronger relationships with their peers. As a result, they develop essential life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and conflict resolution, which are vital for success in both personal and professional spheres.In conclusion, while understanding ideas and concepts is undoubtedly important, I strongly believe that learning facts has more significant advantages for students' future lives. By acquiring a strong foundation in factual knowledge, students can tackle real-life problems, develop better social behavior, and become more confident, articulate, and well-rounded individuals. As such, I advocate for a balanced education system that emphasizes both conceptual understanding and factual learning to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in an increasingly complex world.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The importance of sports and social activities in schools has been a topic of debate among educators and policymakers. While some argue that these extracurricular activities distract from the main classes, the benefits they provide to students cannot be overlooked. In my opinion, sports play a vital role in promoting human healthfulness, and their importance cannot be overstated.Engaging in sports not only helps students maintain a good body shape, but also provides them with the energy and health necessary to excel in their academic pursuits. Regular physical activity has been shown to improve cognitive function, boost mood, and reduce stress levels, all of which are essential for students to perform at their best. Furthermore, sports teach valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, which are essential for success in all areas of life.In addition to sports, social activities also have a significant impact on students' overall development. Participating in social activities allows students to interact with their peers, become familiar with different mindsets and environments, and develop essential social skills. These activities also provide students with much-needed entertainment and fun, helping to create a healthy balance between academic and personal life. By engaging in social activities, students can broaden their perspectives, develop empathy, and build lasting relationships.In conclusion, sports and social activities are not mere add-ons to the main classes, but rather an integral part of a student's overall education. They provide students with the physical and mental well-being, social skills, and entertainment necessary to thrive in all areas of life. As such, I firmly believe that sports and social activities should be given equal importance as the main classes, and that students should be encouraged to participate in them to reap their numerous benefits.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet is undoubtedly one of the most significant inventions of the past century, revolutionizing the way we live, work, and communicate. While some individuals argue that the internet is a source of numerous problems due to the vast amount of information available, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In my opinion, the internet is a valuable resource that provides daily necessary information, enables people to gain knowledge, and allows them to explore the world.The internet has made it possible for people to access a vast array of information from anywhere in the world, at any time. With just a few clicks, we can obtain news, weather forecasts, and other essential information that helps us stay updated and make informed decisions. Moreover, the internet has democratized access to knowledge, enabling people to learn about various subjects, from science and history to art and culture. Online educational resources, such as e-books, tutorials, and online courses, have made it possible for people to acquire new skills and expand their knowledge.Furthermore, the internet has bridged geographical gaps, allowing people to explore the world and connect with others across the globe. Social media platforms, blogs, and online forums have enabled people to share their experiences, cultures, and ideas, fostering global understanding and exchange. The internet has also facilitated international trade, commerce, and tourism, promoting economic growth and development.In conclusion, while some people may argue that the internet is a source of problems, I strongly believe that its benefits, including providing daily necessary information, enabling knowledge acquisition, and facilitating global exploration, make it an invaluable resource. As we continue to navigate the digital age, it is essential to harness the internet's potential to promote education, understanding, and progress, while being mindful of its limitations and challenges.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The university is a hub of learning where individuals acquire knowledge and skills that can be applied in real-life situations. It is a place where students can explore their interests, develop their passions, and shape their future. Some universities adopt a specialized approach, requiring students to focus on a single subject throughout their academic journey. However, I firmly believe that studying multiple subjects is more beneficial than specializing in just one.By studying various subjects, students have the freedom to explore their interests and passions, allowing them to discover their strengths and weaknesses. This approach enables them to gain a broader range of knowledge and skills, which can be applied across multiple fields. For instance, a student who studies both business and psychology can develop a unique understanding of human behavior and organizational dynamics, making them a more versatile and attractive candidate in the job market.Furthermore, studying multiple subjects provides students with a wider range of career options and flexibility in their future choices. By gaining knowledge in multiple fields, students can switch between industries or roles more easily, as they possess a diverse set of skills and expertise. In contrast, specializing in a single subject may limit a student's career prospects and make them more vulnerable to changes in the job market.In conclusion, I strongly advocate for the benefits of studying multiple subjects over specializing in one. By doing so, students can explore their interests, gain a broader range of knowledge and skills, and increase their career options. Ultimately, this approach can lead to a more fulfilling and successful academic and professional journey.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;In my opinion, the government should prioritize the basic needs of its citizens above all else. The fundamental necessities that people require to lead fulfilling lives are often overlooked in the pursuit of economic growth and development. However, I firmly believe that the government's primary focus should be on providing its people with the essential elements that constitute a decent standard of living.First and foremost, a stable job is the cornerstone of a person's well-being. A secure income not only puts food on the table but also provides a sense of purpose and dignity. The government should therefore invest in creating employment opportunities, as well as providing training and education to equip its citizens with the skills required to thrive in the modern workforce. By doing so, the government can ensure that its people have a reliable means of supporting themselves and their families.In addition to employment, the government should also prioritize the preservation of a good environment. A clean and healthy environment is essential for the physical and mental well-being of its citizens. This can be achieved through initiatives such as reducing pollution, investing in renewable energy, and promoting sustainable practices. By protecting the environment, the government can safeguard the health and quality of life of its people.Lastly, the government should also recognize the importance of love and support within families. A stable and loving family unit is crucial for the emotional and psychological development of individuals, particularly children. The government can provide support for families through initiatives such as family counseling, childcare services, and financial assistance for low-income families. By fostering a sense of community and support, the government can help build stronger, more resilient families.In conclusion, the government's primary responsibility is to ensure that the basic needs of its people are met. By prioritizing jobs, a good environment, and love in families, the government can lay the foundation for a happy, healthy, and prosperous society. It is only when these fundamental needs are fulfilled that people can truly thrive and reach their full potential.

282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The primary role of teachers in schools is to impart knowledge to students, and this task must be completed within a limited timeframe. As a result, teachers often face the challenge of having to cater to the needs of an entire class, rather than individual students. In an ideal world, teachers would be able to devote personalized attention to each student, tailoring their instruction to meet the unique needs and learning abilities of every child. However, the reality is that teachers are constrained by time and class size, making it impossible to provide one-on-one attention to each student.Furthermore, the learning abilities of students vary significantly. Some students are able to grasp complex concepts with ease, while others may struggle to keep up. This disparity in learning abilities makes it unfair to judge a teacher's effectiveness solely based on the test results of their students. By doing so, we risk creating a high-stakes, high-stress environment that prioritizes rote memorization over genuine understanding and critical thinking.Moreover, tying teacher pay to student test results can lead to a narrow focus on test preparation, rather than fostering a love of learning and promoting academic curiosity. This approach can also lead to teacher burnout and dissatisfaction, as they are held accountable for factors beyond their control, such as student motivation, home environment, and socio-economic status. Instead, teachers should be evaluated based on their ability to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment, their willingness to adapt to the needs of their students, and their commitment to helping each child reach their full potential. By recognizing the complexities of teaching and learning, we can work towards creating a more equitable and effective education system.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The notion that movies and dramas typically feature happy endings, where good triumphs over evil and the virtuous are rewarded, has been a long-standing convention in the entertainment industry. This formulaic approach to storytelling often sees the bad characters receiving their comeuppance, while the good ones bask in happiness and success. However, I firmly believe that this simplistic portrayal of life can be misleading, particularly for young children.In reality, life is not always so neatly packaged. Good people, unfortunately, can sometimes experience unfortunate endings, despite their moral integrity and positive actions. The complexities of real life do not always guarantee a happy ending for those who deserve it, simply because they are good. By consistently portraying a world where virtue is always rewarded, we risk creating unrealistic expectations and a distorted view of reality for young, impressionable minds.It is essential to convey to children that the real world does not operate on such straightforward principles. They need to understand that life is filled with unpredictabilities and that sometimes, despite one's best efforts and good intentions, bad things can still happen. This awareness can help them develop a more resilient and realistic outlook on life, preparing them for its inevitable challenges.Moreover, portraying a more nuanced and realistic representation of life in media can foster a deeper understanding and empathy in children. By showing that good people can face hardships and that life's outcomes are not solely determined by one's moral character, we can encourage a more mature and compassionate worldview. It's crucial, therefore, to move away from the simplistic good-vs-evil, happy-ending paradigm and towards a more realistic and varied representation of life's experiences. This can help young viewers develop a more balanced and realistic expectation of the world, preparing them better for the complexities of real life.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The advent of technology has led to a significant rise in distance learning, with many institutions offering online courses as an alternative to traditional classroom learning. While there are numerous advantages to distance learning, such as increased flexibility and accessibility, I firmly believe that it should not replace classroom learning entirely. The statement that we should replace normal courses with online courses is one that I completely disagree with, and for good reason.Firstly, classroom learning provides a unique opportunity for face-to-face interaction between students and instructors, which is essential for effective learning. The personal touch and human connection that comes with traditional learning cannot be replicated in an online setting. Students are able to ask questions, engage in discussions, and receive immediate feedback, all of which are crucial components of a comprehensive education.Furthermore, classroom learning promotes socialization and teamwork among students, which are essential life skills that cannot be developed in isolation. Online courses often lack the social aspect of learning, leaving students to work independently without the opportunity to collaborate with their peers. Additionally, traditional learning environments provide students with access to resources such as libraries, laboratories, and other facilities that are essential for hands-on learning and research.While distance learning has its advantages, it is not a suitable replacement for classroom learning. Online courses can be a useful supplement to traditional learning, but they should not be relied upon as the sole means of education. By maintaining a balance between traditional and online learning, students can reap the benefits of both, while also developing the essential skills and relationships that are fostered in a classroom setting. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that we should replace normal courses with online courses, and believe that a combination of both is the key to a well-rounded education.

There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself.

This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;Throughout my life, I have encountered numerous circumstances that have profoundly impacted my thought process and approach to challenges. One of the most significant experiences that has shaped me into a more prudent person is my time studying at university. The academic environment and rigorous coursework have taught me the importance of careful planning, strategic thinking, and effective problem-solving. As I navigated through complex assignments and tight deadlines, I learned to prioritize tasks, manage my time efficiently, and approach problems with a clear and level head.Moreover, my university experience has not only honed my academic skills but also instilled in me a sense of self-reliance and independence. I have learned to take care of myself, both physically and mentally, in the face of adversity. For instance, I have developed healthy habits such as regular exercise, balanced eating, and sufficient sleep to maintain my overall well-being. Additionally, I have learned to seek help when needed, whether it be from professors, peers, or counseling services, which has taught me the value of asking for support and building a strong support network.These experiences have collectively contributed to my personal growth, enabling me to become a more resilient and resourceful individual. I have come to realize that challenges are an inevitable part of life, but it is how we respond to them that defines our character and determines our success. As I continue to navigate through life's journey, I am confident that the lessons I have learned and the skills I have acquired will serve as a sturdy foundation, empowering me to tackle future obstacles with prudence, confidence, and determination. Ultimately, my experiences have transformed me into a more self-assured and capable person, ready to face the complexities and uncertainties of the world.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;The Importance of Studying Foreign Languages AbroadIn today's globalized world, foreign languages have become increasingly important. As a result, many people are pursuing the study of foreign languages to enhance their career prospects, to improve their understanding of different cultures, and to broaden their perspectives. Among the various ways to learn a foreign language, one option stands out as particularly effective: going to another country to learn the language. In this essay, I will argue that studying a foreign language in a foreign country is the best way to learn, and I will provide several reasons to support my opinion.Firstly, immersing oneself in the language and culture of the country where the language is spoken is the most effective way to learn. By living in a foreign country, one is surrounded by the language and is forced to use it in everyday situations, such as shopping, ordering food, and communicating with locals. This hands-on experience enables learners to pick up the language quickly and naturally. Moreover, being in a foreign country provides learners with ample opportunities to practice their language skills with native speakers, which is essential for improving pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.Secondly, studying a foreign language in a foreign country provides learners with a unique cultural experience. Learners can attend language schools, participate in cultural events, and engage with local communities, which helps them to gain a deeper understanding of the language and its cultural context. This cultural immersion is essential for developing a nuanced understanding of the language and for becoming proficient in using it in various social situations.In conclusion, studying a foreign language in a foreign country is the best way to learn a language. The immersive experience, cultural exposure, and opportunities to practice with native speakers make it an ideal option for language learners. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to communicate in a foreign language will become even more valuable, and studying abroad is the key to unlocking this valuable skill.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;When considering a place to call home, the primary factors that come into play are the public utilities and surroundings. These elements play a crucial role in determining the quality of life and overall comfort of a community. In my hometown, there is an abundance of public utilities that cater to one's basic needs, making it an attractive place to reside. However, despite the availability of essential services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation, there is a notable absence of reliable public transportation.The lack of efficient transportation systems in my community is a significant concern that I would like to see addressed. Public transportation is a vital component of any urban or suburban area, as it enables residents to move freely and access various amenities, services, and opportunities. Without a robust transportation network, daily commutes become a challenge, and the community's overall connectivity and productivity suffer. As a result, residents are forced to rely on personal vehicles, which can lead to increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and decreased quality of life.To enhance the livability of my hometown, I firmly believe that introducing more public transportation options is essential. This could include buses, trains, or even bike-sharing systems, which would provide residents with affordable, convenient, and environmentally friendly ways to get around. By investing in public transportation, the community can become more integrated, sustainable, and appealing to both current and prospective residents. Furthermore, a well-planned transportation system can also boost local economic growth by facilitating the movement of people and goods, thereby creating new opportunities and jobs. Ultimately, the addition of public transportation in my community would greatly improve the overall quality of life, making it a more desirable place to live, work, and thrive.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The pursuit of excellence in education is a multifaceted endeavor that requires input from various stakeholders. One often overlooked yet invaluable source of feedback is students themselves. Gathering opinions from students can significantly augment the performance of educational institutions, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the educational system. Student evaluations provide a unique perspective on the teaching methods, curriculum, and overall learning environment. By soliciting feedback from students, educators can identify areas of strength and weakness,, to refine their teaching strategies and improve student outcomes. This not only benefits the students but also provides teachers with an opportunity to reflect on their performance and make necessary adjustments. As a result, teachers can improve their instructional methods, leading to more effective learning experiences for their students.Moreover, student evaluations can have a broader impact on the educational system as a whole. By aggregating feedback from students across different institutions, policymakers and educational administrators can identify systemic issues and areas for improvement. This can lead to reforms in curriculum design, assessment methods, and educational policies, ultimately enhancing the performance of the entire education system. Student feedback can highlight best practices and suggest innovative approaches to learning, contributing to a more dynamic and responsive educational environment.In conclusion, soliciting opinions from students is a powerful tool for improving the quality of education. It not only helps teachers to refine their craft but also contributes to systemic improvements in education. By valuing student feedback, educational institutions can foster a culture of continuous improvement, leading to better educational outcomes and a more effective education system. As such, student evaluations should be a integral component of any strategy aimed at enhancing educational performance and achieving excellence in learning.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;The world of employment is divided into two main categories: small and large companies. While small companies usually operate on a local scale, providing jobs and services to the immediate area, large companies have a broader reach, working in an international context to cater to the needs of the entire nation and even foreign countries. As I contemplate my future career, I must confess that I personally prefer to work for a large company, and my reasoning is threefold.Firstly, I believe that finding a job in a large company is significantly easier than securing a position in a small company. Large corporations often have more vacancies and a more formalized hiring process, making it more accessible for job seekers to apply and get hired. In contrast, small companies may have limited openings and a more informal recruitment process, which can make it harder for candidates to get noticed.Secondly, I think that larger companies are more likely to offer better salaries and benefits compared to smaller ones. With more resources and a larger budget, large companies can afford to pay their employees more competitively, providing them with a higher standard of living. This is a significant draw for me, as financial stability is a crucial aspect of any career.Lastly, I have a passion for travelling and exploring different cultures, and working for a large company would provide me with the perfect opportunity to do so. With their international reach and operations, I would have the chance to travel around the world, experience new environments, and work with people from diverse backgrounds. This prospect excites me, and I believe that it would not only broaden my professional horizon but also enrich my personal life. Overall, the benefits of working for a large company far outweigh those of a small company, making it my preferred choice for a future career.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;The role of colleges and universities in providing academic skills to individuals cannot be overstated. These institutions play a pivotal role in equipping people with the necessary knowledge and expertise to pursue their goals and achieve success. The question of who should have access to these opportunities, however, is a subject of debate. Some argue that this chance should be reserved for good students, implying that only those who demonstrate academic excellence should be afforded the opportunity to acquire advanced skills. On the other hand, there are those who believe that everyone, regardless of their academic background or prowess, should have the chance to gain these advanced skills. This perspective is rooted in the idea that education is a fundamental right and that it has the power to transform lives and societies. By making academic opportunities accessible to all, colleges and universities can foster a more inclusive and equitable learning environment. This, in turn, can lead to a more diverse and skilled workforce, which is essential for driving innovation and economic growth.Moreover, providing academic skills to a broader range of people can have a positive impact on societal development. Education empowers individuals, enabling them to make informed decisions, contribute to their communities, and participate fully in the democratic process. It also helps to bridge the gap between different socio-economic groups, promoting social mobility and reducing inequality. Therefore, while the idea of preserving academic opportunities for good students may seem logical, it is more beneficial for society as a whole if everyone is given the chance to acquire advanced skills. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of our population, leading to a more prosperous and harmonious society. Ultimately, the provision of academic skills by colleges and universities should be based on the principle of inclusivity and equality, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to pursue their goals and reach their full potential.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The Rise of Online Gaming: A Threat to Academic PerformanceIn recent years, a growing concern has emerged among educators and parents regarding the impact of online computer games on students' academic performance. A large number of students have become obsessed with these games, spending hours on end immersed in virtual worlds. Unfortunately, this obsession has led to a significant decline in their performance in school. As students devote more time to gaming, they inevitably neglect their studies, leading to poor grades and a lack of academic progress.Moreover, online computer games offer little to no educational value. Unlike other activities, such as reading or sports, which can foster personal growth and development, gaming provides no tangible benefits. The time spent on these games is essentially time wasted, as students could be engaging in more productive and enriching activities. Instead, they are exposed to a world of fantasy and escapism, which can have long-term negative effects on their cognitive and social skills.Furthermore, the majority of online games feature mature themes, including war, violence, blood, and sex, which can have a corrupting influence on young minds. These games often glorify aggressive behavior and desensitize players to the consequences of violence, leading to a lack of empathy and a distorted view of reality. As a result, students who spend excessive time playing these games may become desensitized to the needs and feelings of others, leading to social and emotional problems.In conclusion, the obsession with online computer games among students is a pressing concern that requires attention from educators, parents, and policymakers. The decline in academic performance, the lack of educational value, and the exposure to mature themes all highlight the need for students to find more productive and enriching activities to engage in. By doing so, we can ensure that our students develop into well-rounded, empathetic, and academically successful individuals.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;The importance of in-person collaboration in the workplace cannot be overstated. When team members work together in person, it can indirectly improve the quality and efficiency of a project. One of the primary reasons for this is the reduction in conflicts and disagreements amongst team members. When individuals are able to communicate face-to-face, they are better able to understand each other's perspectives and work through challenges together.Research has borne out the benefits of in-person communication. An experiment conducted by Beijing University found that people are able to reach agreements quickly when they are able to talk to each other in person. This is likely due to the fact that nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, are able to convey important information that can get lost in digital communication. When team members are able to pick up on these cues, they are better able to navigate complex discussions and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.While digital communication tools, such as email, are not ideal for collaborative work, they are still better than no communication at all. However, they lack the nuance and depth of in-person communication, and can often lead to misunderstandings and conflict. In contrast, in-person communication allows team members to build trust, establish a rapport, and work together seamlessly. Ultimately, the benefits of in-person collaboration make it an essential component of any successful project. By working together in person, teams can ensure that their projects are completed efficiently, effectively, and to a high standard of quality. As such, it is clear that in-person collaboration is an invaluable tool that should be utilized whenever possible.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The increasing involvement of university professors in scientific research has sparked a debate about the potential impact on education quality. While some may fear that this trend will lead to a decline in teaching standards, I firmly believe that professors should be encouraged to prioritize research. Through my experiences, I have witnessed firsthand the numerous benefits that research-oriented professors bring to the academic environment.When professors are actively engaged in research, they are more likely to stay updated with the latest developments in their field, which in turn enhances their teaching. They can share their research experiences and findings with students, providing them with a more comprehensive and cutting-edge education. Moreover, research-oriented professors often involve students in their projects, offering them valuable hands-on experience and mentorship. This not only deepens students' understanding of the subject matter but also fosters their critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills.Furthermore, research contributes to the advancement of knowledge and innovation, which is a fundamental aspect of a university's mission. By supporting professors' research endeavors, universities can promote intellectual curiosity, creativity, and progress. This, in turn, can lead to breakthroughs that benefit society as a whole. Professors who are passionate about research are also more likely to be enthusiastic and motivated teachers, as they can see the direct application and relevance of what they are teaching.In conclusion, rather than being a distraction from teaching, I believe that research is an integral component of a professor's role. By encouraging professors to prioritize research, universities can create a vibrant academic community that values discovery, innovation, and the pursuit of knowledge. This will ultimately lead to a more engaging and effective learning experience for students, and a more significant contribution to the advancement of society. Therefore, I strongly support the notion that professors should be encouraged to mainly focus on research, as it has the potential to elevate both education quality and societal progress.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The debate about the most effective way to learn has sparked intense discussion among educators and students alike. While some prefer to learn independently, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is the superior approach. In my opinion, the guidance and support provided by a teacher are essential for optimal learning and personal growth.When learning alone, the opportunity for feedback, discussion, and debate is severely limited. Without a teacher to facilitate these interactions, a student's ability to cooperate with others and express their opinions is hindered. Effective communication and teamwork are crucial skills in today's fast-paced, interconnected world, and learning with a teacher provides the ideal environment to develop these skills. Through classroom discussions, group projects, and presentations, students learn to articulate their thoughts, listen to others, and work collaboratively towards a common goal.In contrast, self-directed learning can be isolating and limiting. Without the structure and guidance provided by a teacher, it is easy to fall behind or lose motivation. Moreover, when learning independently, students often lack the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions, ask questions, and clarify doubts. This can lead to a shallow understanding of the material and a lack of depth in their knowledge. Furthermore, the absence of a teacher's feedback and assessment can make it difficult for students to gauge their progress and identify areas for improvement.In conclusion, while self-directed learning has its advantages, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is the more effective and beneficial approach. The guidance, support, and opportunities for interaction and feedback provided by a teacher are essential for developing important life skills, such as cooperation, communication, and critical thinking. By learning with a teacher, students can maximize their potential, develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, and become more confident, articulate, and effective individuals.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;"The advent of high technology has led many to believe that they are fortunate to be living in this era. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that technology has also made our lives more complicated. There are several reasons and examples that substantiate this claim.Firstly, the plethora of options and information available to us has created a sense of overwhelm. With the rise of social media, online shopping, and streaming services, we are constantly bombarded with choices, making it difficult to make decisions. For instance, a simple task like choosing a restaurant for dinner can become a daunting task, with countless options and reviews to sift through. This abundance of information has led to a phenomenon known as ""choice paralysis,"" where individuals become so overwhelmed that they are unable to make a decision at all.Secondly, technology has also created new avenues for stress and anxiety. The constant need to be connected and available has led to an ""always-on"" culture, where individuals feel pressured to be constantly checking their emails, messages, and notifications. This has resulted in a sense of perpetual stress, as individuals feel like they are never truly disconnected from work or other obligations. Furthermore, the rise of cyberbullying and online harassment has also added to the complications of modern life, making it a source of anxiety and fear for many.In conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly made our lives more convenient and connected, it is essential to recognize the complications it has also introduced. The overwhelm of options, the stress of constant connectivity, and the rise of online harassment are just a few examples of how technology has made our lives more complicated. As we continue to navigate this high-tech era, it is crucial to be aware of these complexities and strive for a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of technology."
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The debate about the most effective way to provide education has been ongoing, with some arguing that online classes are the way forward, while others believe that classroom learning is the best approach. In my opinion, classroom learning is the superior method of education compared to online classes. One of the primary advantages of classroom learning is that it teaches students the importance of completing study work on time. With regular assignments and deadlines, students are forced to manage their time effectively, ensuring that they stay on top of their work. This, in turn, helps to develop their time management skills, which are essential for success in all areas of life.Another significant benefit of classroom learning is the role that professors play. In a traditional classroom setting, professors are able to provide valuable information and guidance to their students. They are able to answer questions, provide feedback, and offer support when needed, which is often lacking in online classes. Professors are also able to create a engaging and interactive learning environment, which helps to keep students motivated and interested in the subject matter. Additionally, professors can adapt their teaching style to meet the needs of their students, which is not always possible in online classes.In contrast, online classes often lack the structure and support that classroom learning provides. Without the pressure of regular deadlines and the guidance of professors, students can easily fall behind and struggle to stay motivated. Furthermore, online classes can lack the social interaction and human connection that is present in a traditional classroom, which is essential for building relationships and developing important life skills. In conclusion, classroom learning is the best way to provide education, as it teaches students the importance of time management, provides valuable guidance and support from professors, and offers a structured and interactive learning environment.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The concept of teenagers doing part-time jobs while studying has sparked a debate among many people. Some individuals do not support this idea, arguing that it may interfere with their academic performance. However, in my view, I strongly believe that it is beneficial for teenagers to take up part-time jobs alongside their studies.Firstly, having a part-time job teaches teenagers valuable life skills such as time management and money management. By juggling their studies and work, they learn to prioritize tasks, manage their time effectively, and make the most of their schedule. Additionally, part-time jobs provide students with the opportunity to develop essential communication skills, enabling them to convince people with their words, whether it be with customers, colleagues, or managers.Another significant advantage of part-time jobs for teenagers is the financial aspect. By earning their own money, students can contribute to their family's income, alleviating some of the financial burden from their parents. This not only helps their parents but also instills a sense of responsibility and independence in the teenager. Furthermore, having their own income allows students to make smart financial decisions, such as saving for their future, or spending wisely on their needs and wants.In conclusion, doing a part-time job while studying is an excellent way for teenagers to gain valuable skills, earn money, and develop a sense of responsibility. Rather than hindering their academic performance, part-time jobs can actually complement their studies, teaching them essential life skills that will benefit them in the long run. Therefore, I firmly believe that teenagers should be encouraged to take up part-time jobs, as it can have a profoundly positive impact on their personal and professional growth.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;In today's globalized world, it has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language. As the world shrinks and people from different countries interact with each other, it is inevitable that one will encounter foreigners at some point in their lifetime. Whether it be for educational, professional, or personal purposes, the ability to communicate in a foreign language has become a vital skill. Moreover, learning a foreign language not only broadens one's cultural understanding but also enhances career opportunities and fosters global connections.It is also better that people learn a foreign language in their own country. This approach has several advantages. Firstly, learning a foreign language in one's own country allows for a more gradual and comfortable learning process. Students can learn at their own pace, without the pressure of being immersed in a foreign environment. Additionally, learning a foreign language in one's own country provides access to a wider range of resources, such as language schools, tutors, and language learning materials. Furthermore, learning a foreign language in one's own country also enables students to practice their language skills with fellow learners, which can be a great motivator and help to build confidence.In conclusion, learning a foreign language has become a necessity in today's interconnected world. It is an essential skill that can open doors to new opportunities and experiences. Moreover, learning a foreign language in one's own country is the most effective and comfortable way to acquire this skill. By doing so, individuals can develop a strong foundation in the language, build their confidence, and ultimately become proficient communicators in a foreign language. As the world continues to globalize, the importance of learning a foreign language will only continue to grow, making it an indispensable part of one's personal and professional development.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate about the ideal school vacation system has been ongoing, with many people advocating for one long vacation at the end of the academic year. Proponents of this system argue that it allows students to start the new academic year with a strong zeal for learning, having had a prolonged break to rest and recharge. However, I firmly believe that several small breaks throughout the year would be more beneficial for students' academic performance and overall well-being.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year would help keep the stress levels of students low. A single long break may provide an initial sense of relief, but it can also lead to a prolonged period of idleness, which can be detrimental to a student's academic momentum. In contrast, multiple small breaks would provide regular opportunities for students to relax, recharge, and refocus, thereby maintaining a healthy balance between academics and leisure time. This, in turn, would help students approach their studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm, rather than feeling burnt out and exhausted.Furthermore, multiple breaks would allow students to pace themselves better, avoid burnout, and maintain a consistent level of academic performance throughout the year. It would also give them ample opportunities to pursue extracurricular activities, hobbies, and interests, which are essential for their holistic development. In conclusion, multiple small breaks are essential to ensure that students remain active, motivated, and engaged in their academics, ultimately leading to better academic outcomes and a more enjoyable learning experience.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";The Pursuit of Goals: A Lesson in PerseveranceAt the age of nearly thirty, I achieved a significant milestone in my life - winning a medal. This accomplishment was not only a testament to my hard work and dedication, but also a valuable lesson in the importance of perseverance. Through this experience, I have come to believe that a person should never give up on their goals, no matter how daunting or impossible they may seem.My journey to winning the medal was not an easy one. It took years of tireless effort, countless setbacks, and unwavering commitment. There were times when I felt like giving up, when the obstacles seemed insurmountable and the progress was slow. However, I persisted, driven by my passion and determination to succeed. And finally, after nearly three decades of life, my efforts paid off.This experience has taught me that success is not solely dependent on talent or luck, but on the willingness to keep trying and learning from failures. It has shown me that every setback is an opportunity to grow and improve, and that every step forward, no matter how small, brings us closer to our goals. I have come to realize that the only way to guarantee failure is to give up, and that the only way to ensure success is to keep pushing forward, even when the journey gets tough.In conclusion, my experience of winning a medal at the age of nearly thirty has been a profound lesson in the power of perseverance. It has taught me that a person should never lose sight of their goals, and should always keep striving to achieve them, no matter how long it takes. I firmly believe that with persistence, determination, and hard work, anyone can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals, and I hope that my story will inspire others to do the same.
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;In recent years, a disturbing trend has emerged in developed countries, where the majority of individuals have adopted a low saving rate. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that people tend to spend their earnings immediately, or even resort to taking loans to finance their expenses. In my opinion, saving a portion of one's earnings is essential, and this essay will delve into the rationale behind this assertion.The primary reason why saving is crucial is that it provides a financial cushion against unforeseen future developments. Life is inherently unpredictable, and unexpected expenses can arise at any moment. For instance, medical emergencies, car repairs, or losing a job can all lead to significant financial strain. By setting aside a portion of their earnings, individuals can ensure that they have a safety net to fall back on during such times. This not only reduces stress and anxiety but also prevents the need to take on debt, which can lead to a vicious cycle of interest payments and financial hardship.Furthermore, saving allows individuals to plan for long-term goals, such as retirement, buying a house, or funding their children's education. By consistently setting aside a portion of their earnings, individuals can make steady progress towards achieving these goals, rather than relying on credit or last-minute scrambling. In conclusion, saving a portion of one's earnings is vital in today's unpredictable world. It provides a sense of security, allows for planning and preparation, and helps individuals navigate life's unexpected twists and turns. As such, it is imperative that individuals prioritize saving and make it a habitual part of their financial routine.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;The advent of modern technologies and globalization has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. Over the past few decades, the speed of life has increased exponentially, transforming our daily routines into a frenzy of activity. In my opinion, it is crucial to adopt a slower pace of life, as the alternative - living in a hurry - comes with a plethora of disadvantages.First and foremost, living life on the fast lane is incredibly stressful. The constant pressure to meet deadlines, respond to messages, and keep up with the latest trends can be overwhelming, leading to increased anxiety and tension. This, in turn, can have severe consequences on our physical and mental health. Research has shown that chronic stress can lead to a range of health problems, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and a weakened immune system. By slowing down, we can better manage our stress levels, prioritize self-care, and maintain a healthier work-life balance.Furthermore, living life at a slower pace allows us to appreciate the beauty and simplicity of the world around us. In our haste, we often overlook the small joys and pleasures that make life worth living. By adopting a more relaxed attitude, we can cultivate mindfulness, creativity, and meaningful relationships. We can savor our experiences, engage with nature, and nurture our passions, leading to a more fulfilling and purposeful life.In conclusion, while modern technologies and globalization have accelerated the pace of life, it is essential to recognize the importance of slowing down. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative effects of stress, cultivate a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, and truly appreciate the beauty of life. As we navigate the complexities of the modern world, let us make a conscious effort to prioritize our well-being and adopt a slower, more mindful pace of life.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;The world's population has undergone a significant transformation over the past centuries, with a steady and relentless growth. For the first time in history, the global population has surpassed seven billion,. This unprecedented milestone has far-reaching implications for the health of our planet. As the human population continues to expand, we are inadvertently destroying the natural habitats that sustain us, including forests, jungles, and lakes. This destruction not only harms the ecosystem but also has a ripple effect on the environment as a whole.The ecosystem is a delicate balance of interconnected components, and our actions are disrupting this balance. By destroying natural habitats, we are robbing the ecosystem of its essential functions, including air and water purification, soil formation, and climate regulation. A stable and sustainable environment is essential for maintaining normal weather patterns. However, our behavior is causing irreparable harm to the environment, leading to pollution, which in turn, heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth.The consequences of pollution are multifaceted and devastating. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are just a few examples of the damage we are causing. It is imperative that we recognize the gravity of our actions and take immediate steps to mitigate the harm. We must adopt sustainable practices, reduce our carbon footprint, and preserve the natural habitats that are essential for maintaining a healthy ecosystem. The future of our planet depends on our ability to act responsibly and protect the environment. By working together, we can ensure a sustainable and thriving planet for generations to come.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The debate on whether students should be required to attend classes or not has been a longstanding issue in academic circles. While some students believe that attending classes is a necessity, others think it is optional. In my opinion, at the university level of education, students have reached a sufficient level of maturity to make their own choices about attending classes.To begin with, attending classes can sometimes be a waste of time. Many lecturers deliver lectures in a monotonous and unengaging manner, which can lead to students feeling disinterested and disconnected from the material being taught. In such cases, attending classes can be seen as a mere formality, where students are physically present but mentally absent. Furthermore, with the advancement of technology, students can easily access lecture notes, recordings, and other study materials online, making physical attendance seem redundant.However, it is also important to acknowledge that some lecturers deliver lectures in a highly informative and interesting way. These lecturers are able to engage their students, stimulate discussion, and foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. In such cases, attending classes can be incredibly beneficial, as students can interact with the lecturer, ask questions, and clarify doubts. This interactive learning experience can be invaluable in helping students to grasp complex concepts and develop critical thinking skills.Ultimately, I believe that students at the university level should be given the autonomy to choose whether or not to attend classes. By doing so, they can take responsibility for their own learning, prioritize their time, and make the most out of their academic experience. With great power comes great responsibility, and it is up to the students to decide how they want to utilize their time and resources to achieve academic success.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The advent of technology has sparked a heated debate among individuals, with many grappling with the question of whether it simplifies or complicates their lives. While some argue that technology introduces new layers of complexity, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, ultimately making life simpler and more convenient.On the one hand, it is understandable that technology can contribute to a sense of overwhelm and confusion. The constant stream of information, the need to stay updated with the latest software and hardware, and the potential for technological glitches can indeed make life more complicated. However, these complications are relatively minor compared to the vast array of benefits that technology offers.On the other hand, technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. It provides unparalleled access to information, enabling us to learn, work, and connect with others across the globe with ease. Simple tasks such as banking, shopping, and communication have been transformed, allowing for speed, efficiency, and convenience that were previously unimaginable. Moreover, technological advancements in healthcare, transportation, and education have significantly improved the quality of life, offering solutions to problems that were once deemed insurmountable.In conclusion, while technology may introduce some complexities, its overall impact on simplifying and enhancing our lives is undeniable. It has opened doors to new opportunities, simplified mundane tasks, and connected the world in ways that have made living, working, and interacting more convenient and accessible than ever before. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely to bring even more innovative solutions to the complexities of life, further cementing its role as a simplifier of our daily lives. Ultimately, the benefits of technology in making life simpler and more convenient outweigh the minor complications it may introduce.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";The mass media has become a dominant force in shaping our perceptions and influencing our culture. However, it is lamentable that they often prioritize superficial content over substantive issues. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the relentless pursuit of ratings and readership. Television channels and newspapers frequently focus on the lives of famous individuals,This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that we live in a society where appearance and gossip are highly valued. The media caters to this obsession by splashing sensational stories and images of celebrities across their platforms. As a result, the audience is fed a constant diet of trivia and frivolity, rather than being informed about pressing issues that truly matter.The emphasis on celebrity culture has far-reaching consequences. It creates a culture of voyeurism, where people are more interested in the private lives of others than in engaging with meaningful topics. Furthermore, it perpetuates the notion that physical appearance and fame are the ultimate measures of success. This can have a corrosive effect on self-esteem and body image, especially among young people who are bombarded with unrealistic beauty standards and celebrity worship.In conclusion, the mass media's preoccupation with superficial content is a reflection of our societal values. By prioritizing fame and appearance over substance, the media reinforces a culture of superficiality. It is imperative that we, as consumers of media, recognize the importance of seeking out diverse and meaningful content, and demand more from the media outlets we support. Only then can we hope to create a more balanced and informed society, where the media plays a constructive role in shaping our perceptions and values.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;As I reflect on my life, I am reminded of the numerous benefits of growing up in a small town. Born and raised in this charming community, I have been fortunate enough to develop strong bonds with the people around me. The friendships I have formed here are truly invaluable, and I feel grateful to have such a supportive network of acquaintances. One of the aspects I adore about my hometown is the traffic, or rather, the lack thereof. The peaceful and serene atmosphere that pervades our streets is a stark contrast to the chaos and congestion that often plagues larger cities. This, in turn, contributes to a wonderful environment that is perfect for relaxation and recreation. The beauty of nature, coupled with the quaint charm of our town, makes it an ideal place to call home.My experiences have led me to believe that staying in one place is preferable to constantly moving from one location to another. The stability and sense of belonging that comes with putting down roots in a community is essential for personal growth and development. By staying in one place, I have been able to establish a strong foundation of friendships, pursue long-term goals, and develop a deep appreciation for the local culture and environment. In contrast, moving frequently can be disorienting and disrupt relationships, making it challenging to form lasting connections.In conclusion, my life in this small town has been incredibly fulfilling, and I firmly believe that staying in one place has been the key to my happiness. The strong relationships, peaceful environment, and sense of community that I have found here are treasures that I cherish deeply. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue growing and contributing to the town that has given me so much.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;The decision of where to live during university years is a crucial one for students. While some opt to live in dormitories, others choose to live off campus. Both options have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. It provides them with easy access to libraries, classrooms, and other academic facilities. Additionally, dormitories offer a sense of community and camaraderie among students, which can be beneficial for freshmen who are adjusting to university life.On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for real life. It teaches them valuable skills such as independence, responsibility, and time management. For instance, students living off campus have to manage their own schedules, cook their own meals, and take care of their own laundry. These tasks may seem mundane, but they are essential life skills that are often overlooked in dormitory life. Moreover, living off campus encourages students to be punctual and cooperative, as they have to work together with their roommates to maintain a harmonious living environment.Living off campus also provides students with the opportunity to interact with people from diverse backgrounds and age groups, which can broaden their perspectives and help them become more open-minded. In contrast, living in university dormitories can be limiting in terms of exposure to different cultures and lifestyles. In conclusion, while living in a dormitory has its advantages, living off campus is a more holistic experience that prepares students for the challenges of real life. It teaches them valuable skills, fosters independence, and broadens their perspectives, making them more confident and self-sufficient individuals.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;The concept of working efficiently has become a crucial aspect of achieving success in today's fast-paced world. While some may argue that working rapidly is a risky approach, it is essential to acknowledge that it has a significant place near the ideal goal. By working fast, individuals can complete tasks quickly, thereby allowing themselves more time to study and expand their knowledge. This, in turn, can lead to improved skills and a competitive edge in their respective fields.Moreover, the current economic climate has led to an increase in expenses, making it necessary for people to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet. It is not uncommon to see individuals working in two or three firms in a week, highlighting the need for rapid work pace. By working efficiently, people can manage their time effectively, allowing them to juggle multiple responsibilities and meet their financial obligations.On the other hand, working slowly can be a significant hindrance in today's demanding work environment. Individuals who work at a slower pace may find it challenging to handle multiple tasks, leading to decreased productivity and a higher likelihood of errors. In contrast, those who work rapidly can take on more tasks, manage their time effectively, and deliver quality results. This not only enhances their professional reputation but also opens up opportunities for career advancement.In conclusion, working rapidly, although risky, has its benefits and is often necessary in today's fast-paced world. By working efficiently, individuals can create more opportunities for themselves, manage their time effectively, and achieve their goals. As the expenses continue to rise, it is essential for people to adapt to the changing work environment and develop the skills necessary to work rapidly and efficiently.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;The traditional requirement that university students must pass an exam before attending classes has been a long-standing practice in many institutions. However, from my perspective, I strongly believe that students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing an exam. One of the primary reasons for this is that students are not constantly experts in every part of a subject. It is unrealistic to expect students to have a comprehensive understanding of a particular field before they even begin their university education. In fact, many students may not have been exposed to certain subjects or topics prior to university, and therefore, may not have the necessary foundation to pass an exam. By allowing students to attend classes without first passing an exam, they can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and build their knowledge from the ground up.Furthermore, attending classes provides students with the opportunity to engage with the material, ask questions, and clarify any misconceptions they may have. This interactive learning environment is essential for students to grasp complex concepts and develop their critical thinking skills. By requiring students to pass an exam before attending classes, we may be inadvertently hindering their ability to learn and grow. Instead, universities should focus on providing a supportive and inclusive learning environment that allows students to explore and discover new ideas, regardless of their prior knowledge or exam results.In conclusion, I firmly believe that students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing an exam. By allowing students to attend classes without first passing an exam, we can provide them with the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, engage with the material, and develop their critical thinking skills. This approach will ultimately lead to a more inclusive and effective learning environment, where students can thrive and reach their full potential.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;University education is a pivotal aspect of an individual's life, serving as a foundation for future success and personal growth. As such, it is crucial to orientate students in a manner that maximizes their potential and prepares them for the challenges of the real world. The question of how best to achieve this orientation has sparked debate, with some advocating for the increase of professors' salaries as a primary strategy. However, I firmly believe that this approach is misguided.While professors are undoubtedly essential to the educational process, providing guidance, knowledge, and mentorship, the primary focus of universities should always be on the students themselves. The ultimate goal of university education is to equip students with the skills, knowledge, and critical thinking abilities necessary to thrive in their chosen careers and contribute positively to society. Therefore, the allocation of resources should reflect this priority.Rather than raising the salaries of professors, I propose that funds should be directed towards enhancing the facilities and updating the resources available to students. Modern, well-equipped libraries, state-of-the-art laboratories, and comfortable, conducive learning environments are just a few examples of how investments can be made to directly benefit the student body. Moreover, updating educational resources to include the latest technology and teaching methodologies can significantly enhance the learning experience, making it more engaging, interactive, and effective.By focusing on the development of infrastructure and resources, universities can create an environment that fosters academic excellence, creativity, and innovation among students. This approach not only aligns with the core mission of educational institutions but also ensures that the needs and interests of students, the primary stakeholders, are given the utmost priority. In conclusion, while professors play a vital role in the educational process, the best way to orientate students towards success is by investing in the facilities and resources that directly support their learning and development.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The debate about the status of pets in our lives has sparked a heated discussion. While some people believe that pets should be treated like family members, others argue that they are just animals and lack the cognitive abilities of humans. In my opinion, pets deserve to be treated with the same love and respect as our family members.Firstly, pets are our loyal companions and friends, often providing a listening ear and comfort that some humans may not offer. They may not be able to engage in complex conversations, but they listen to us with unwavering attention, often more attentively than some people. This unique ability to connect with us on a deeper level makes them an integral part of our lives. Pets provide emotional support, companionship, and a sense of belonging, which are essential for our well-being.Secondly, pets can be incredibly useful in various aspects of our lives. For instance, the concept of pet therapy has gained immense popularity in recent years. Trained animals, such as dogs and cats, are being used to provide comfort, affection, and emotional support to people in need, including hospital patients, elderly individuals, and those with mental health issues. The benefits of pet therapy are numerous, ranging from reduced stress and anxiety to improved mood and social skills. This highlights the significant role that pets can play in improving our mental and physical health.In conclusion, pets are more than just animals; they are our friends, companions, and in some cases, our therapists. Their ability to listen, provide comfort, and offer unconditional love makes them an essential part of our lives. As such, they deserve to be treated with the same love, respect, and care that we would offer to our human family members. By recognizing the value and importance of pets in our lives, we can work towards creating a more compassionate and inclusive society that values the unique bond between humans and animals."
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;As I reflect on my personal preferences, I have come to realize that I have a strong inclination towards living in bigger cities rather than small ones. This attitude is shaped by a multitude of factors that have contributed to my outlook on urban living. Firstly, I am drawn to the excitement and vibrancy that big cities embody. The dynamic environment of a metropolis is a significant allure, offering a rich and diverse experience that is hard to find in smaller towns. The hustle and bustle, the eclectic mix of cultures, and the endless array of entertainment options all combine to create an infectious energy that I find irresistible. Living in a big city means being at the heart of the action, with something always happening, and this is a prospect that I find deeply appealing.Secondly, big cities are hubs for career advancement and higher income opportunities. Unlike small towns, where job markets are often limited and salaries are generally lower, big cities are home to a wide range of industries and companies, offering a broader spectrum of career paths and better remuneration. The potential for professional growth and financial stability in a big city is significantly higher, making them more attractive to individuals like myself who are looking to advance in their careers and improve their standard of living.In conclusion, my preference for living in bigger cities stems from the unique blend of lifestyle and opportunity that they offer. The excitement and career opportunities available in big cities create a compelling argument for why they are the ideal place for me to reside. As someone who values both personal and professional growth, I believe that living in a big city is essential for realizing my full potential and experiencing all that life has to offer.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";The role of government in urban development is a multifaceted one, with various priorities vying for attention. While historic and traditional building preservation is important for cultural and heritage reasons, it is essential that governments prioritize new building construction. The primary focus should be on providing adequate and comfortable living spaces for citizens, as this is a fundamental human need.Constructing new buildings that are accommodating and meet the basic needs of the population is crucial for ensuring that people can live harmoniously. A decent place to live is the foundation upon which a person's quality of life is built. Without it, individuals and families are unable to thrive, leading to a range of social, economic, and health problems. Governments must recognize that the provision of housing is not just a matter of bricks and mortar, but a vital component of social stability and cohesion.By prioritizing new building construction, governments can address issues of overcrowding, homelessness, and substandard living conditions. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on public health, education, and economic productivity. Furthermore, new constructions can be designed with sustainability and energy efficiency in mind, contributing to a reduction in environmental degradation and the mitigation of climate change.In contrast, while historic preservation is valuable, it should not take precedence over the basic needs of the current population. The balance between preserving the past and building for the future is delicate, but it is the latter that should take priority. By focusing on the construction of new, accommodating buildings, governments can ensure that their citizens have a foundation upon which to build their lives, leading to more harmonious and prosperous communities. Ultimately, the government's primary responsibility is to its current citizens, and providing them with decent living conditions is a fundamental aspect of this duty.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I firmly agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time, but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. In my opinion, this statement holds true for several reasons. Firstly, every tough experience we encounter makes us more skilled and improves our decision-making abilities. When we face challenges, we are forced to think critically and come up with creative solutions, which ultimately enhances our problem-solving skills. As a result, we become more adept at handling similar situations in the future, making us more confident and self-assured.Furthermore, our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong, often unknowingly. When we navigate through tough times, we develop resilience, which is essential for overcoming obstacles and achieving success. The struggles we face help us build character, making us better equipped to deal with the complexities of life. These experiences, though difficult at the time, become valuable lessons that shape us into stronger and wiser individuals. By going through hardships, we learn to appreciate the good times and develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.In conclusion, the difficult experiences we face in life may seem tough at the time, but they indeed become important lessons for the future. They make us more skilled, improve our decision-making, and make us robust and strong. By embracing these experiences and learning from them, we can grow and develop as individuals, becoming better equipped to handle the challenges that life throws our way. Ultimately, it is through these tough experiences that we discover our inner strength and emerge stronger, wiser, and more resilient.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The debate about whether drivers should be charged an extra fee during rush hours has sparked intense discussion. Critics argue that the exorbitant use of oil and the selfish conduct of drivers warrant an additional payment to discourage such behavior. However, I firmly hold the contention that no extra fee should be imposed on drivers.From a pragmatic perspective, traffic jams are a natural phenomenon that cannot be entirely avoided or banned. The congestion that occurs during peak hours is often the result of a multitude of factors, including road infrastructure, incomplete public transportation systems, and the sheer number of vehicles on the road. It is unreasonable to expect drivers to completely avoid rush hour traffic, as for many, it is an unavoidable necessity. People need to commute to work, school, and other essential destinations, and the timing of these trips is often outside of their control.Imposing an extra fee on drivers during rush hours would unfairly penalize them for a situation that is largely beyond their control. It would also disproportionately affect those who are already struggling financially, as they would be forced to bear the additional cost of commuting. Instead of charging drivers, governments and urban planners should focus on implementing sustainable and efficient transportation solutions, such as improving public transportation, increasing road capacity, and promoting carpooling and alternative modes of transportation. By addressing the root causes of traffic congestion, we can work towards reducing the economic and environmental impacts of rush hour traffic, rather than simply shifting the burden onto drivers.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";As students, we often hear our parents warning us that adult life is much more demanding than school life. They remind us that the responsibilities and pressures of the real world are far greater than anything we experience in the classroom. However, it's challenging for us to fully comprehend the gravity of their words without firsthand experience. This is where part-time jobs come into play, offering us a unique opportunity to glimpse into the life of a working adult.By taking on a part-time job, students can experience the realities of adult life, gaining valuable insights into the daily struggles and challenges that come with it. Unlike spending holidays playing computer games or indulging in leisure activities, part-time jobs provide a platform for us to develop essential life skills, such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving. These skills are crucial in the adult world, where independence and self-reliance are highly valued.Engaging in part-time work during holidays is, therefore, the best way for students to spend their break. Not only do we earn a income, but we also gain exposure to the workforce, understanding the expectations and pressures that come with being a working adult. This experience is invaluable, as it prepares us for the transition from school to the professional world, making us more aware of the responsibilities and challenges that lie ahead. By choosing to work part-time during our holidays, we take the first step towards independence, self-discovery, and a deeper understanding of what it truly means to be an adult.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";The pursuit of academic success is a multifaceted endeavor, influenced by a myriad of factors. One such crucial element is the pattern of work that an individual chooses to adopt while studying. Personally, I have always been inclined towards individual work rather than team-based learning, and this preference stems from several key reasons.To begin with, my temperament plays a significant role in this preference. As someone who is introspective and slightly reserved, I find that individual work allows me to focus more intently on the task at hand, without the distractions or pressures that can sometimes accompany group work. This is not to say that I am averse to teamwork or lack the skills to collaborate effectively, but rather, I believe that my productivity and understanding of the material are enhanced when I work independently.Another reason I favor individual work is the flexibility it offers. When working alone, I can set my own pace, decide when and how I want to study, and manage my time more efficiently. This autonomy is particularly beneficial for someone like myself, who values organization and meticulous planning. It enables me to delve deeper into topics that interest me, without feeling rushed or held back by the pace of others.Lastly, individual work allows for a more personalized approach to learning. I can tailor my study sessions to fit my learning style, whether that involves making detailed notes, creating concept maps, or practicing problems. This tailored approach not only makes learning more enjoyable but also more effective, as I am better able to identify and address my weaknesses.In conclusion, my preference for individual work over team work is rooted in my personal temperament, the need for flexibility in my study schedule, and the desire for a personalized learning experience. While team work has its own set of benefits, I believe that recognizing and respecting individual differences in work patterns is essential for maximizing study achievements.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;The concept of having one's own job is a highly desirable goal for many individuals, and I am no exception. Despite the various challenges that come with being one's own boss, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. For me, personally, having my own job is the ultimate preference.First and foremost, time is the most valuable commodity I possess, and having my own job allows me to manage it effectively. When I am my own boss, I have the freedom to allocate my time as I see fit, prioritizing tasks and activities that are truly important to me. This autonomy enables me to strike a perfect balance between work and personal life, leading to a more fulfilling and productive existence.Secondly, earning a sufficient income is a fundamental aspect of working, and having my own job provides me with the opportunity to dictate my own financial destiny. The amount of money one earns is often the primary criterion for choosing a job, and as my own boss, I can strive to create a business or career that generates a satisfactory income. This financial independence is a significant motivator, as it allows me to support myself and pursue my passions without being beholden to someone else's expectations or limitations.In conclusion, having my own job is a highly appealing prospect, offering me the chance to value my time and earn a comfortable income. While there may be problems associated with being one's own boss, I believe that the advantages make it an worthwhile pursuit. Ultimately, the freedom and financial rewards that come with having my own job make it an aspiration worth striving for.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago.

Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";Historic buildings are invaluable treasures that hold significant importance in preserving the past and educating future generations. These structures provide a unique window into the lives of people who lived thousands of years ago, offering valuable lessons about their culture,,assistant, lifestyle, and traditions. By exploring and learning from historic buildings, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of human civilization and the development of modern societies.The lifestyle of people who lived in ancient times is vividly reflected in the architecture, design, and layout of historic buildings.

322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;The Role of Parents as TeachersIt is often said that no one makes a better teacher than our parents. From the moment we are born, parents take on the role of educators, guiding us through the simplest of tasks to complex life lessons. As infants, they teach us how to smile, walk, and perform everyday routines such as eating. These fundamental lessons lay the foundation for our future development and are essential for our growth. As we grow older, our parents continue to impart valuable ethical lessons that shape our character and influence our decisions throughout our lives.In my opinion, the significance of parental teaching cannot be overstated. We spend a substantial amount of time at home with our families, far exceeding the time we spend at school. This prolonged exposure to our parents' guidance and wisdom allows us to learn and absorb valuable lessons that are not always taught in a traditional classroom setting. Our parents' teachings extend beyond academics,,assistantinstilling in us important values such as honesty, respect, and responsibility. These life skills are crucial for our personal and professional development, enabling us to become well-rounded and responsible individuals.Furthermore, parental teaching is tailored to our individual needs and learning styles, allowing for a more personalized and effective learning experience. Our parents are able to identify our strengths and weaknesses, providing targeted guidance and support to help us overcome challenges and achieve our goals. In contrast, traditional educational settings often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, which may not cater to the unique needs of each student.In conclusion, the role of parents as teachers is unparalleled. Their influence on our lives is profound, shaping our values, behaviors, and attitudes from a young age. As we navigate the complexities of life, the lessons we learn from our parents remain with us, guiding us towards becoming responsible, compassionate, and successful individuals. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and appreciate the invaluable contributions our parents make to our education and personal growth.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;The ability to adapt oneself to a new environment has become an essential aspect of any job. In today's fast-paced and ever-changing work landscape, being able to quickly adjust to new situations and challenges is crucial for success. This adaptability is a key component of a job, as it enables employees to navigate unfamiliar terrain, whether it be a new role, team, or company.However, while working alone can be a viable option in the short-term, it is not a sustainable approach in the long-term. Effective communication is a vital skill that sets excellent employees apart from others. When individuals possess excellent knowledge of their job, they are able to communicate their ideas, insights, and expertise to others, leading to a more collaborative and productive work environment.Moreover, employees with excellent knowledge of their job are a valuable asset to any organization. Their expertise and experience can benefit the company until they leave, as they are able to mentor, train, and guide their colleagues. This, in turn, leads to a ripple effect of knowledge sharing and skill development, ultimately benefiting the company as a whole. Every worker with excellent knowledge contributes to the collective success of the organization, making them a vital component of the team.In conclusion, the ability to adapt to new environments and the possession of excellent job knowledge are highly valued assets in the workplace. Companies that prioritize these skills and foster a culture of communication and collaboration will reap the benefits in the long run. As such, it is essential for employees to continuously develop their skills and knowledge, and for organizations to support and nurture their workers' growth, to ensure a bright and successful future for all.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers has revolutionized the way societies function, with a profound impact on economic, business, and other sectors. The integration of computers into various industries has not only enhanced efficiency but also transformed the nature of work. Computers have taken over many tasks that were previously performed by humans, reducing the need for manual labor in numerous sectors.On one hand, the use of computers has brought about numerous advantages. They have increased productivity, improved accuracy, and enabled the automation of repetitive tasks. This has led to significant cost savings and enhanced competitiveness for businesses. Moreover, the internet and computer networks have facilitated global communication, enabling the exchange of ideas, services, and goods across the world. The economic and business sectors have particularly benefited from these advancements, with computers playing a crucial role in data analysis, financial transactions, and supply chain management.On the other hand, the increased reliance on computers has also led to a significant reduction in human employment opportunities. Many jobs that were once performed by humans are now automated, leading to job losses in various sectors. For instance, in the manufacturing industry, computers and robots have replaced human workers in assembly lines and production processes. Similarly, in the service sector, automated systems and artificial intelligence are increasingly being used to provide customer service, further diminishing the need for human intervention.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly enhanced the efficiency and productivity of various industries, their impact on employment cannot be overlooked. As computers continue to advance and play an even more integral role in societies, it is essential to address the challenges they pose to human employment. This may involve training and educating workers to adapt to new roles that complement computer technology, ensuring that the benefits of technological advancements are shared by all members of society.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;The Acquisition of Foreign Languages in Childhood: A Catalyst for Cognitive and Cultural EnrichmentIn today's interconnected world, learning a foreign language has become an indispensable tool for children's cognitive and cultural development. Acquiring a foreign language is not merely a matter of communicating with people from other countries, but it also plays a pivotal role in strengthening children's ability to learn. This learning process significantly enhances their mental faculties, including memory and problem-solving skills, thereby improving their overall capacity for learning.Beyond the cognitive benefits, learning a foreign language opens up a window to the world, broadening children's perspectives and fostering a deeper understanding of diverse cultures. As they delve into the linguistic and cultural nuances of another nation, they gain valuable insights into the customs, traditions, and ways of life of people from other parts of the globe. This expanded vision not only enriches their personal worldview but also equips them with the empathy and tolerance necessary to thrive in an increasingly globalized society.Furthermore, the early acquisition of a foreign language can have long-term benefits, including enhanced career opportunities and a competitive edge in the job market. In an era where international collaboration and exchange are on the rise, the ability to communicate in multiple languages can prove to be a valuable asset, connecting individuals across geographical boundaries and facilitating mutual understanding and cooperation.In conclusion, introducing children to foreign languages is a forward-thinking strategy that not only sharpens their learning abilities and mental agility but also cultivates a global mindset. By embracing linguistic diversity, we empower the next generation with the skills, knowledge, and perspectives necessary to navigate, contribute to, and lead in a multicultural and multilingual world. Therefore, incorporating foreign language learning into children's education should be a priority, recognizing its potential to enrich both their minds and their future.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;The debate about whether boys and girls should study together has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, co-education, where boys and girls study together, has numerous benefits. One of the primary advantages is that it provides an opportunity for both sexes to interact and understand each other. By studying together, boys and girls can learn how to behave with the opposite sex, which is essential in today's society. A boy will learn how to speak and interact with a girl in various situations, and vice versa. This helps to break down social barriers and stereotypes, promoting mutual respect and understanding.Moreover, co-education prepares students for the real world, where they will inevitably interact with people of the opposite sex. By learning how to communicate and work together, boys and girls can develop essential life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. This, in turn, can lead to more harmonious and productive relationships in their personal and professional lives.However, some experts argue that attending the same school can cause disadvantages for both boys and girls. They claim that it can lead to distractions, decreased focus, and increased social pressures. Nevertheless, I believe that these drawbacks can be mitigated by implementing effective teaching methods and discipline. In fact, many successful co-educational institutions have demonstrated that boys and girls can study together without any significant disadvantages.In conclusion, I firmly believe that boys and girls should study together. The benefits of co-education, including the opportunity to learn how to interact with the opposite sex, outweigh the potential drawbacks. By studying together, boys and girls can develop essential life skills, break down social barriers, and prepare themselves for the real world. As such, co-education is an essential aspect of a well-rounded education, and it should be encouraged and promoted in our schools.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The notion that ""the biggest risk is not taking any risk"" has been aptly stated by Aristotle. This profound statement highlights the importance of embracing risk-taking in order to achieve success. Many individuals are often held back by their fear of failure, which prevents them from pursuing their dreams. However, it is crucial to persevere and never give up on one's aspirations.A prime example of someone who exemplified this mindset is Walt Disney. Disney's career is a testament to the rewards of taking risks and overcoming obstacles. Despite facing numerous challenges and rejections, he remained committed to his vision. He was fired from his first job at a newspaper for ""lacking creativity"" and even experienced bankruptcy with his first animation company, Laugh-O-Gram Studio. Nevertheless, Disney's unwavering determination and passion for his craft ultimately led to the creation of the beloved Mickey Mouse and the establishment of the Disney empire.Disney's story serves as a powerful reminder that failure is an inevitable part of the journey to success. Rather than being discouraged by setbacks, one should learn from them and continue to strive towards their goals. By taking risks and persevering through challenges, individuals can unlock their full potential and achieve greatness. As Aristotle's quote suggests, the greatest risk is indeed playing it safe and never attempting to pursue one's dreams. By embracing risk-taking and maintaining a resilient mindset, individuals can turn their aspirations into reality, just like Walt Disney did. Ultimately, it is the courage to take risks and never give up that separates those who achieve their dreams from those who do not."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";As humans, we often find ourselves in situations where we are required to do things that don't necessarily bring us joy. However, this is a basic part of life. It's essential to recognize that not every task or activity will be enjoyable, but that doesn't mean we should avoid them altogether. In fact, doing things we don't enjoy can be a crucial aspect of personal and professional growth.In our professional lives, we are often faced with tasks that are necessary parts of our jobs, but not necessarily enjoyable. Attending boring conferences, working with difficult colleagues, or taking on tedious projects can be a drag. Nevertheless, these tasks are essential to our careers and often require us to step out of our comfort zones. By pushing through these unpleasant tasks, we can develop valuable skills, build resilience, and demonstrate our commitment to our work.Interestingly, doing something we don't really enjoy can sometimes lead to unexpected enjoyment. For instance, taking on a new project that seems daunting at first can eventually become a source of pride and satisfaction. Similarly, attending a conference that initially seems boring can lead to unexpected connections and insights. By being open to new experiences, even if they don't initially appeal to us, we can discover new passions and interests. Ultimately, doing things we don't enjoy can help us develop a sense of purpose, build character, and foster personal growth. By embracing the idea that not everything we do will be enjoyable, we can cultivate a more positive and resilient attitude towards life's challenges.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The question of when young adults should leave their parents' homes has been a topic of debate for many years. As young adults transition into independence, they often seek more freedom and autonomy, desiring to live on their own and make their own decisions. However, the issue of what is the right age for this transition is a contentious one, with opinions varying widely depending on cultural, social, and economic factors.Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time. Living with parents can provide young adults with a sense of security and stability, allowing them to focus on their education and career without the added burden of financial responsibilities. Additionally, living with parents can also foster a sense of responsibility and respect for family, as young adults learn valuable life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and time management.Moreover, the current economic climate makes it increasingly difficult for young adults to afford living on their own, with rising costs of housing, education, and living expenses. By living with their parents, young adults can save money, reduce debt, and invest in their future. This, in turn, can lead to a more stable and secure transition into independence, reducing the risk of financial struggles and emotional stress.In conclusion, while the desire for independence and freedom is understandable, I firmly believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time. The benefits of living with parents, including financial security, emotional support, and valuable life skills, outweigh the desire for immediate independence. By delaying the move into independent living, young adults can set themselves up for long-term success and stability, making the transition into adulthood a more positive and empowering experience.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The last hundred years have witnessed a profound transformation in the way people communicate with each other, largely driven by the advent of technology. From my perspective, this development has been overwhelmingly positive, despite some notable drawbacks. One of the most significant benefits of this technological shift is the ease with which we can now keep in touch with loved ones who are geographically distant. In the past, keeping in touch with family and friends who lived far away was a cumbersome and time-consuming process, often involving handwritten letters that could take weeks or even months to arrive. With the advent of technologies such as the telephone, followed by the internet, email, social media, and video conferencing platforms, communication has become almost instantaneous. This has not only made it easier to maintain existing relationships but has also facilitated the formation of new ones across geographical boundaries.Furthermore, technology has enabled people to access a wealth of information and connect with others who share similar interests, creating global communities that transcend physical locations. This has opened up unprecedented opportunities for collaboration, education, and cultural exchange. For instance, online platforms now allow students to enroll in courses taught by institutions on the other side of the world, and professionals to work remotely as part of international teams.While there are valid concerns about the impact of technology on face-to-face interactions and the potential for social isolation, the overall effect of technological advancements on communication has, in my view, been profoundly positive. It has bridged distances, fostered global connectivity, and empowered people with the ability to reach out and engage with others across the globe, thereby enriching our personal and professional lives in ways previously unimaginable.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The advent of machines has undoubtedly revolutionized the way societies function, bringing about numerous benefits that have transformed the fabric of our daily lives. One of the most significant advantages of machines is their unparalleled effectiveness compared to human capabilities. Unlike humans, machines do not require rest or breaks, which means they can operate continuously without any interruption. This unique attribute enables them to work tirelessly around the clock, as long as their employers deem necessary, thus maximizing productivity and efficiency.The consistency and precision that machines bring to the production process are also noteworthy. Human workers, no matter how skilled or diligent, are prone to making mistakes due to fatigue, lack of concentration, or simple human error. Machines, on the other hand, once properly programmed and maintained, can consistently produce high-quality products without any deviations or mistakes. This level of reliability is especially crucial in industries where precision and uniformity are paramount, such as in manufacturing, healthcare, and aerospace.Furthermore, the ability of machines to work without fatigue not only increases output but also enhances safety in the workplace. In tasks that are hazardous or require repetitive motions that could lead to injuries over time, machines can take over, reducing the risk of workplace accidents and ensuring a safer environment for human workers. Additionally, with machines handling the more mundane and dangerous tasks, human workers can focus on tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and innovation, leading to overall economic and societal growth.In conclusion, machines have indeed brought many benefits to society, ranging from increased productivity and precision to enhanced safety and efficiency. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that the role of machines in our lives will expand, leading to further advancements and improvements in various sectors. By embracing the capabilities of machines and effectively integrating them into our workflows, we can unlock new potentials for development and prosperity.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The field of Information Technology (IT) is rapidly evolving, with scientists discovering and developing new, magnificent devices every day. These innovations have revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. Interactive boards, multicore computers, laptops, and tablets with incredible resolution have become an integral part of our daily lives. These devices have enabled us to access and process vast amounts of information with unprecedented speed and efficiency.The impact of these devices on education, business, and entertainment has been profound. Interactive boards have transformed the classroom experience, making learning more engaging and interactive. Multicore computers and laptops have enabled professionals to work more efficiently, while tablets have made it possible to access information and entertainment on-the-go. The incredible resolution of these devices has also enabled us to enjoy high-quality visuals and graphics, making them ideal for gaming, video editing, and other graphic-intensive applications.However, there are also some negative aspects of information technology that cannot be ignored. One of the major concerns is the potential for addiction and social isolation. Excessive use of these devices can lead to a decline in face-to-face interaction, deepening feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Moreover, the ease of access to information has also raised concerns about privacy and security. The risk of cyberbullying, hacking, and identity theft is ever-present, making it essential for users to be vigilant and take necessary precautions.In conclusion, while the devices discovered in the field of IT have brought about numerous benefits and improvements to our lives, it is essential to acknowledge and address the negative aspects associated with them. By being aware of these potential drawbacks and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure that the benefits of information technology are realized while minimizing its harmful effects.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The phenomenon of fame has become a significant aspect of modern society, with many individuals idolizing celebrities and public figures. However, this attention to famous people has sparked concerns among many, particularly when it comes to its impact on children. The influence of famous individuals on their admirers, especially the younger generation, is undeniable. As role models, they have a great responsibility to set a good example, as their actions and behavior are closely watched and often emulated by their fans.The pressure to maintain a flawless public image can be overwhelming, and any misstep can have serious consequences. Moreover, the excessive media coverage of famous people's lives can have a profound impact on children's perceptions and aspirations. The constant bombardment of news and updates about celebrities' lifestyles, wealth, and glamour can create unrealistic expectations and promote materialism. As a result, many children may be influenced to pursue careers in the entertainment industry or other fields that promise fame and fortune, rather than exploring more meaningful and substantial professions.This can have long-term consequences, as it may lead to a lack of skilled professionals in essential fields such as science, technology, engineering, and medicine. Furthermore, the emphasis on fame and celebrity culture can also perpetuate a culture of superficiality, where appearance and popularity are valued over substance and talent. It is essential for famous individuals, as well as the media, to recognize the responsibility that comes with their influence and to use their platforms to promote positive values and role models. By doing so, they can help shape a more balanced and informed perspective among their young admirers, and encourage them to pursue careers that are fulfilling, meaningful, and beneficial to society as a whole.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way we live, bringing unparalleled convenience and entertainment to our daily lives. People of all ages have embracing this technology, and it has become an indispensable part of our modern lifestyle. However, as beneficial as mobile phones may seem, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention also causes numerous social problems.One of the primary concerns is that excessive reliance on mobile phones can lead to a decline in interest in daily activities. As people spend more time glued to their screens, they tend to neglect essential aspects of their lives, such as social interactions, exercise, and hobbies. This can result in a sedentary lifestyle, where individuals miss out on valuable experiences and opportunities for personal growth. Moreover, the constant distraction provided by mobile phones can also negatively impact productivity and cognitive function, as individuals become increasingly dependent on their devices.Furthermore, the continuous use of mobile phones can have detrimental effects on the physical health of children. Prolonged screen time can lead to damage to their eyesight, as the blue light emitted from screens can cause strain and discomfort. Additionally, the sedentary nature of mobile phone use can also lead to poor physical posture, as children spend hours hunched over their devices, rather than engaging in physical activity. This can have long-term consequences for their overall health and wellbeing, making it essential for parents and caregivers to monitor and regulate mobile phone use among children.In conclusion, while mobile phones have undoubtedly brought many benefits to our lives, it is crucial to acknowledge the social problems they can cause. By being aware of these issues, we can take steps to mitigate their negative effects and ensure that mobile phones are used in a responsible and healthy manner.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern forms of communication has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. With the advent of email and messaging, individuals can now connect with others across the globe without any limitations of time and space. This has made it possible for people to maintain relationships and communicate with others who are geographically distant. The flexibility and convenience of these modern forms of communication have made them an essential part of our daily lives.One of the significant advantages of modern communication is that it allows people to connect with others at any time and from any location. Emails and messages can be sent and received at any hour of the day, making it possible for people to communicate with others who are in different time zones. This has been particularly beneficial for business and professional communication, where timely communication is crucial.However, despite the numerous benefits of modern communication, it has also had some negative impacts on people's social lives. The over-reliance on digital communication has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining meaningful relationships. Moreover, the constant need to be connected and responsive to messages and emails can lead to stress and anxiety. Additionally, the lack of non-verbal cues in digital communication can often lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.In conclusion, while modern forms of communication have made it easier for people to interact with others, they also have some demerits. It is essential to strike a balance between the use of digital communication and face-to-face interactions to maintain healthy and meaningful relationships. By being mindful of the potential pitfalls of modern communication, we can harness its benefits while minimizing its negative impacts on our social lives. Ultimately, effective communication is key to building and maintaining strong relationships, and it is up to us to use these modern tools in a way that enhances our social connections rather than detracting from them.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The concept of competitiveness and cooperativeness in children has been a topic of interest among psychologists and educators. Research has shown that competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle situations independently. This is because competitive environments encourage children to take risks, push their limits, and develop a sense of self-reliance. As a result, they become more self-assured and capable of tackling challenges on their own. This independence can be beneficial in various aspects of life, such as academics, sports, and personal growth.On the other hand, co-operative children have a unique potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team. When children work together towards a common goal, they develop essential skills such as communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. This collaborative approach fosters creativity, as diverse perspectives and ideas are shared and built upon. Co-operative children learn to value and respect the contributions of others, leading to a more harmonious and productive team dynamic.Both competitiveness and cooperativeness have their own values, and it is essential to strike a balance between the two. While competitiveness can drive individual achievement, cooperativeness can lead to groundbreaking innovations and a stronger sense of community. By acknowledging and nurturing both aspects, we can raise children who are not only confident and self-reliant but also empathetic, open-minded, and skilled at collaboration. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that both competitive and co-operative children have the potential to excel in their own unique ways, and that a balanced approach can help them develop into well-rounded and accomplished individuals. By embracing and fostering both competitiveness and cooperativeness, we can empower children to reach their full potential and make a positive impact in the world.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The advent of technology has been a double-edged sword, bringing about both positive and negative influences on society. While it is undeniable that technology has negative effects in many respects, such as contributing to social isolation, decreasing attention span, and increasing cyberbullying, I strongly believe that it has large positive effects on relationships between people.On the one hand, technology has made it possible for people to connect with each other across geographical boundaries, fostering global communication and understanding. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, bridging the distance and strengthening relationships. Additionally, technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, creating online communities and forums that transcend physical locations.On the other hand, technology has also enabled people to maintain relationships that may have otherwise been lost due to physical distance or busy schedules. For instance, a person who has moved to a new city can still keep in touch with old friends and acquaintances through social media, and even schedule regular video calls to catch up. Moreover, technology has also facilitated the formation of new relationships, such as online friendships and romantic relationships, which can be just as meaningful and fulfilling as in-person relationships.In conclusion, while technology may have negative influences in many respects, its positive effects on relationships between people cannot be overstated. By enabling global communication, fostering online communities, and maintaining relationships across distances, technology has revolutionized the way we connect and interact with each other. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that its positive effects on relationships will only continue to grow, bringing people closer together and fostering a more interconnected and harmonious global community.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The importance of traditional skills and lifestyles in modern society cannot be overstated. Despite the rapid advancements in technology and urbanization, these age-old practices continue to play a vital role in various aspects of our lives, including healthcare, environmental protection, and cultural heritage. By preserving and promoting traditional skills and lifestyles, we can tap into the wisdom of our ancestors and harness their knowledge to address contemporary challenges.In the realm of healthcare, traditional practices such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and holistic healing have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating various ailments. These approaches often focus on preventive care, emphasizing the importance of balance and harmony in maintaining physical and mental well-being. By incorporating these traditional methods into modern healthcare systems, we can provide more comprehensive and sustainable solutions to health problems.Moreover, traditional skills and lifestyles are essential for environmental protection. Indigenous communities have long been stewards of the natural world, employing sustainable practices such as permaculture, agroforestry, and eco-friendly architecture. These approaches have allowed them to thrive in harmony with their environments, minimizing their ecological footprint. By learning from these traditional practices, we can develop more effective strategies for conserving biodiversity, reducing waste, and mitigating climate change.The preservation of traditional skills and lifestyles also enables us to better understand and appreciate ancient cultures. By studying and respecting the customs, beliefs, and values of our ancestors, we can gain a deeper insight into the evolution of human societies and the development of our collective cultural heritage. This, in turn, allows us to build upon the wisdom of the past, utilizing it to tackle modern problems and create a more sustainable and equitable future. In conclusion, the protection and promotion of traditional skills and lifestyles are essential for maintaining a healthy, sustainable, and culturally rich society. By embracing and learning from these ancient practices, we can foster a more holistic and resilient approach to modern challenges.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The age-old debate about whether to instill competitiveness or cooperativeness in children has sparked intense discussion among parents, educators, and psychologists. Some argue that fostering a competitive spirit in children is essential, as it drives them to strive for excellence and pushes them to be the best among their peers. A strong sense of competition encourages children to learn, to practice, and to improve continuously, thereby developing a growth mindset. This, in turn, prepares them for the challenges of the real world, where competition is a harsh reality.On the other hand, others contend that cooperation is a vital quality that children should possess. In a cooperative environment, children learn to work together towards a common goal, share ideas, and build on each other's strengths. This not only enhances their social skills but also promotes a sense of community and mutual respect. Cooperative activities, such as group projects and team sports, teach children the value of collaboration, empathy, and conflict resolution. Moreover, cooperation is essential in school activities, as well as in communities, where children can develop a sense of social responsibility and civic engagement.While both competitiveness and cooperativeness have their merits, it is crucial to strike a balance between the two. Children should be encouraged to strive for excellence, but not at the expense of others. By fostering a cooperative spirit, children can learn to appreciate the value of teamwork, mutual support, and collective achievement. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the drive of competition with the camaraderie of cooperation will equip children with the skills, values, and resilience needed to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. By embracing both competitiveness and cooperativeness, we can raise a generation of children who are not only high achievers but also empathetic and socially responsible individuals.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The impact of advertisement on our lives has been a topic of debate, with some people arguing that its advantages outweigh the harms. While it is true that excessive advertising can have negative effects, such as promoting consumerism and manipulating people's perceptions, it is also undeniable that the advertising industry provides numerous benefits. One of the most significant advantages of advertising is the creation of job opportunities. From producers and writers to models and cameramen, the advertising market offers a wide range of employment options, contributing to the economy and supporting many individuals and families.Moreover, the rise of online advertising has revolutionized the way companies promote their products and services. Online advertisement is one of the easiest and most effective approaches, offering several potential gains. For instance, online advertising is often cheaper than traditional forms of advertising, such as television or print ads, making it more accessible to small businesses and startups. Additionally, online advertising provides convenience, as companies can reach a large audience with minimal effort and cost. Another significant advantage of online advertising is the ease of observing its effectiveness, as companies can track the number of clicks, views, and conversions generated by their ads, allowing them to adjust their marketing strategies accordingly.In conclusion, while some people may argue that the harms of advertisement outweigh its benefits, it is clear that the advertising industry has a significant positive impact on our lives. The creation of job opportunities and the convenience and effectiveness of online advertising are just a few examples of the advantages of advertisement. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online advertising will become even more prevalent, providing companies with new and innovative ways to reach their target audiences and promote their products and services.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The field of art has long been a subject of fascination, with modern artists often receiving high salaries for their masterpiece creations. In contrast, labors are forced to toil for years, breaking their backs to earn a similar amount of money. This stark disparity has sparked a heated debate about the role of government in addressing this unfair situation.On one hand, some people argue that the government should take responsibility for bridging this gap. They contend that the government has a moral obligation to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their profession, are fairly compensated for their work. Proponents of this view point out that the government has the power to implement policies that can help reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, tax breaks for low-income individuals, and investments in education and job training programs.On the other hand, critics argue that government intervention is not the solution to this problem. They claim that the art market is driven by supply and demand, and that the high salaries of modern artists are a reflection of the value that society places on their work. Critics also argue that government interference in the market can have unintended consequences, such as stifling creativity and innovation. They suggest that rather than relying on government handouts, labors should focus on acquiring new skills and adapting to the changing job market to increase their earning potential.Ultimately, the question of whether the government should take responsibility for the unfair salary disparity between modern artists and labors is complex and multifaceted. While some argue that government intervention is necessary to address this issue, others believe that the market should be left to dictate the value of different professions. As the debate continues, it is clear that a nuanced and thoughtful approach is needed to address the underlying causes of income inequality and ensure that all individuals are fairly compensated for their work.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The trend of working extended hours has become a common phenomenon in today's fast-paced world. However, research has shown that this practice has severe adverse effects on an individual's health and personal life. Prolonged working hours often lead to physical and mental exhaustion, causing people to become lethargic and disinterested in engaging in physical activities. As a result, they tend to neglect exercise and other fitness regimes, which are essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.Furthermore, working excessively long hours can lead to an unhealthy obsession with work, transforming individuals into workaholic personalities. This addiction to work can have far-reaching consequences, including strained relationships, social isolation, and a lack of work-life balance. When people become overly invested in their work, they tend to prioritize their professional commitments over personal responsibilities, leading to an imbalance in their overall well-being.The consequences of extended working hours can be devastating, affecting not only an individual's physical health but also their mental and emotional well-being. It is essential for employers and employees to recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance and take steps to prevent the adverse effects of prolonged working hours. This can be achieved by implementing flexible work schedules, encouraging physical activity, and promoting a culture that values employee well-being. By prioritizing health and wellness, individuals can lead more balanced and fulfilling lives, both in and out of the workplace. Ultimately, it is crucial to acknowledge the risks associated with extended working hours and take proactive measures to mitigate them, ensuring a healthier and happier workforce.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The notion of a successful man is often misconstrued as one who possesses a high income. However, this perspective is narrow-minded and fails to encompass the true essence of success. A successful man is, in fact, one who has achieved certain milestones in life, rather than merely accumulating wealth. While money is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of life, it is not the sole determining factor of a person's success.The means of earning a living are diverse and varied, and a person's income is not necessarily a reflection of their accomplishments. A person can earn a substantial income through unscrupulous means, yet still lack a sense of fulfillment and purpose. On the other hand, an individual who has worked tirelessly to achieve their goals, despite earning a modest income, can be considered truly successful.The key to achieving success lies in hard work, dedication, and passion. A person who is driven by a genuine enthusiasm for their craft or field of expertise is more likely to attain their objectives, regardless of the financial rewards. Through perseverance and unwavering commitment, an individual can overcome obstacles and reach their full potential. Ultimately, it is the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that comes from pursuing one's passions that defines a successful man, rather than the size of his paycheck.In conclusion, a successful man is one who has attained certain achievements in life, rather than merely accumulating wealth. The path to success is paved with hard work, dedication, and passion, and it is through these qualities that an individual can truly achieve their goals and find fulfillment. By broadening our definition of success, we can recognize and celebrate the achievements of individuals who have made a meaningful impact in their respective fields, regardless of their financial status.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The influence of advertising on people's consumption choices has become a pervasive phenomenon in today's world. With advertisements bombarding us from every direction - television, streets, magazines, and even social media - it is undeniable that they play a significant role in shaping our buying habits. Many argue that these advertisements have the power to sway individuals into purchasing items they do not necessarily need, merely because they are persuaded by the allure of the product as presented in the ad. This argument holds some truth, as clever marketing strategies can indeed tempt people into making impulse purchases that may not be essential to their daily lives.However, it is also important to consider that buying habits are deeply personal and influenced by a multitude of factors beyond just advertising. An individual's needs, financial capability, personal preferences, and values also significantly contribute to their consumption choices. While an advertisement might catch one's attention and spark interest in a product, the ultimate decision to purchase is often determined by whether the item aligns with the individual's current needs or budget. For instance, a person in need of a new smartphone might be more inclined to purchase one after seeing advertisements, not solely because of the ad, but because they have a genuine need for the product.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly has an impact on people's consumption choices, it is not the sole determinant. Individual needs, financial ability, and personal preferences also play crucial roles in deciding what and when to buy. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the complexity of consumer behavior and not oversimplify it to the influence of advertising alone. By understanding these dynamics, we can better navigate the marketplace, making informed decisions that reflect our true needs and values.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country, and it is widely regarded as a fundamental duty of citizenship. However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfill apart from paying tax. While taxes are essential for the functioning of governments and the provision of public goods and services, I believe that citizens have a broader role to play in ensuring the well-being and prosperity of their communities.For example, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. These individuals often require assistance with daily tasks, access to healthcare, and emotional support. As responsible citizens, it is our duty to provide aid and care to these vulnerable members of our society. This can be achieved through volunteering, donating to charitable organizations, or simply offering a helping hand to those in need. By doing so, we not only improve the lives of others but also contribute to the overall cohesion and stability of our communities.Furthermore, citizens also have a responsibility to engage in civic activities, such as participating in local politics, conserving the environment, and promoting social justice. These actions are crucial in shaping the direction of our societies and ensuring that the rights and interests of all citizens are represented. By fulfilling these responsibilities, citizens can create a more just, equitable, and prosperous society, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. In conclusion, paying taxes is just one aspect of citizenship, and citizens have a range of other important responsibilities to fulfill in order to build a better world for all.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The notion that students should solely focus on academic subjects like mathematics and physics has been a long-standing one. Many people believe that mastering these subjects is essential for securing a job and paving the way for a successful future. However, I would argue that there are many things that are far more important than having a job.While it is true that academic subjects like mathematics and physics can provide students with a strong foundation for their future careers, they do not encompass the entirety of a student's educational experience. In fact, there are many other essential aspects of a student's life that are often overlooked in the pursuit of academic excellence. For instance, social skills, emotional intelligence, and creativity are all vital components of a well-rounded individual, yet they are often relegated to the periphery of a student's education.Furthermore, an overemphasis on academic subjects can lead to a narrow and utilitarian view of education, where the sole purpose of learning is to secure a job. However, education should be about more than just preparing students for the workforce. It should be about fostering a love of learning, promoting personal growth, and helping students develop into thoughtful and engaged members of society. By prioritizing academic subjects above all else, we risk neglecting the very things that make us human, such as our creativity, empathy, and ability to connect with others.In conclusion, while academic subjects like mathematics and physics are undoubtedly important, they should not be the only focus of a student's education. There are many things that are far more important than having a job, such as developing meaningful relationships, pursuing one's passions, and cultivating a sense of purpose and fulfillment. By recognizing the value of these often-overlooked aspects of education, we can work towards creating a more holistic and well-rounded educational experience that prepares students for a life of purpose, happiness, and success.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of internet-based media has sparked a heated debate about the future of traditional paper media. While some argue that newspapers and magazines will continue to thrive, others believe that they will soon become a relic of the past. In my opinion, I agree with the latter argument that traditional paper media will eventually come to an end.The rise of digital media has led to a significant decline in the circulation and readership of newspapers and magazines. With the internet at our fingertips, people can now access news and information instantly, without the need to wait for the next day's newspaper or monthly magazine. Online news portals and social media platforms have become the primary sources of news and entertainment for many, rendering traditional paper media obsolete. Moreover, the environmental concerns associated with paper production and waste management have also contributed to the decline of traditional paper media.Furthermore, the shift to digital media has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced people to stay indoors and rely on online sources for news and entertainment. As a result, many newspapers and magazines have struggled to stay afloat, with some even ceasing publication altogether. While some may argue that traditional paper media still has its loyal readership, I believe that this will not be enough to sustain them in the long run. As technology continues to advance and online media becomes increasingly sophisticated, the appeal of traditional paper media will continue to wane. In conclusion, I firmly believe that traditional paper media will eventually become a thing of the past, replaced by the convenience, accessibility, and sustainability of internet-based media.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;The notion that a job's appeal is solely determined by its salary is a common misconception prevalent in many societies. While a substantial paycheck is undoubtedly a significant factor in choosing a career, it is by no means the only consideration. In fact, other aspects such as friendly colleagues, a pleasant work environment, and favorable workplace conditions often have a more profound impact on an individual's overall happiness and quality of life.A job that offers a high salary but lacks a supportive and friendly work atmosphere can ultimately lead to dissatisfaction and unhappiness. On the other hand, a position with a lower salary but surrounded by colleagues who are encouraging and helpful can greatly contribute to a person's job satisfaction and overall well-being. Moreover, a workplace with a positive and healthy environment can boost an individual's productivity, creativity, and job performance, leading to a more fulfilling career.Furthermore, a job's work-place conditions, such as flexible working hours, opportunities for growth and development, and a healthy work-life balance, can also significantly influence an individual's quality of life. A job that offers a high salary but requires long working hours, excessive stress, and limited time for personal activities can lead to burnout and negatively impact one's physical and mental health. In contrast, a job with a lower salary but offers a better work-life balance, opportunities for growth, and a sense of purpose can lead to a more satisfying and happy life.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it is not the only factor. Friendly colleagues, a pleasant work environment, and favorable workplace conditions are equally vital aspects that can greatly impact a person's happiness and quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when evaluating job opportunities to ensure a fulfilling and satisfying career.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;In today's world, computers have become an indispensable part of our daily lives. The impact of this technological revolution is evident worldwide, and children are no exception. While some may argue that daily computer use can have negative effects on children, this essay disagrees with this notion. On the contrary, computers have proven to be a valuable tool for children, providing them with access to a vast array of resources available on the internet.The internet has opened up a treasure trove of information for children, allowing them to explore and learn about various subjects in an engaging and interactive manner. With just a click of a button, children can access a vast wealth of educational resources, including e-books, educational websites, and online tutorials. This has enabled them to broaden their knowledge, develop their research skills, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their fields of interest.Moreover, computers have also enabled children to connect with other kids and experts from around the world, fostering global understanding, cultural exchange, and collaboration. Online educational platforms and forums provide children with opportunities to engage in discussions, share ideas, and learn from one another. This has helped to break down geographical barriers, promoting a sense of community and cooperation among children from diverse backgrounds.In conclusion, the notion that daily computer use can have negative effects on children is unfounded. On the contrary, computers have revolutionized the way children learn, interact, and access information. By harnessing the power of the internet, children can tap into a vast array of resources, connect with others, and develop essential skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. As such, it is essential that we continue to promote the responsible use of computers among children, ensuring that they can maximize the benefits of this technology while minimizing its potential drawbacks.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that children raised in less well-off families are more quick-witted and better equipped to handle adult life problems than those from affluent backgrounds is a perspective held by some. However, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. To start with, children from poorer families are more susceptible to developing bad habits such as crime, thievery, and thuggery. Growing up in economically challenging environments often exposes them to harsh realities and limited opportunities, which can lead them down a path of delinquency. The lack of resources and positive role models in their lives can significantly contribute to the adoption of antisocial behaviors.Moreover, individuals from less affluent backgrounds often face significant barriers to accessing quality education. Education is a crucial tool that not only imparts knowledge but also fosters critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and social abilities. Without access to good educational facilities, these children are at a disadvantage from the outset. They may struggle to compete with their more affluent counterparts in the job market and other areas of life, ultimately hindering their ability to tackle adult life problems effectively.In contrast, children from more affluent families typically have access to better educational opportunities, a more stable home environment, and a wider range of resources that can help them develop the skills and resilience needed to navigate adult life challenges. While it is true that some individuals from less well-off families may develop certain survival skills, it is misguided to generalize that they are better equipped to handle adult life problems solely based on their economic upbringing. Overall, I believe that a more stable and resource-rich environment is more conducive to raising well-rounded and capable individuals.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The modern world has brought about numerous advancements and improvements in various aspects of life. However, it has also led to the emergence of new health problems and ailments that were previously unheard of. Many people attribute this phenomenon to the sedentary lifestyle that has become increasingly prevalent in today's society. While a sedentary lifestyle is certainly a contributing factor, I firmly believe that other factors are having an even greater impact on the health of modern people.One such factor is the increasing levels of stress and anxiety that people face in their daily lives. The fast-paced and competitive nature of modern society can take a significant toll on a person's mental and physical health. The constant pressure to perform and succeed can lead to chronic stress, which has been linked to a range of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Furthermore, the widespread use of technology and social media has also been shown to have a profound impact on mental health, with many people experiencing feelings of loneliness, isolation, and decreased self-esteem.Another significant factor is the changing nature of the food we eat. The increasing reliance on processed and packaged foods has led to a decline in the overall quality of our diets. These foods are often high in unhealthy ingredients such as salt, sugar, and saturated fats, and low in essential nutrients. This can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, the growing concern about environmental pollution and its impact on human health cannot be ignored. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil our food is grown in are all increasingly contaminated with pollutants, which can have devastating effects on our health. In conclusion, while a sedentary lifestyle is certainly a contributing factor to the health problems faced by modern people, I believe that other factors such as stress and anxiety, poor diet, and environmental pollution are having an even greater impact. It is essential that we take a holistic approach to addressing these issues, and work towards creating a healthier and more sustainable environment for everyone.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The debate surrounding the optimal age to introduce foreign language instruction has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that foreign language instruction should commence in pre-school, others believe it is more effective to introduce it in later years. As for me, I firmly believe that teaching a secondary language as early as kindergarten is not only beneficial but also essential for a child's cognitive and social development.Introducing a foreign language at a young age has numerous advantages. Research has shown that children who learn a second language at an early age tend to develop superior language skills and a more nuanced understanding of the language's nuances. Moreover, kindergarten is an ideal time to introduce a foreign language, as children are naturally curious and possess a keen ability to absorb and mimic new sounds and phrases. This early exposure can also foster a lifelong love of language learning and cultural exploration.Furthermore, teaching a secondary language in kindergarten can also enhance a child's cognitive abilities, such as memory and problem-solving skills. Studies have demonstrated that bilingual children tend to outperform their monolingual peers in various cognitive tasks, demonstrating the cognitive benefits of early language instruction. Additionally, In conclusion, introducing a foreign language as early as kindergarten can have a profound impact on a child's language development, cognitive abilities, and cultural awareness. As such, I strongly advocate for the incorporation of foreign language instruction into kindergarten curricula, as it can provide children with a solid foundation for future academic success and a lifelong appreciation of linguistic and cultural diversity. By starting early, we can set the stage for a generation of globally-minded, linguistically-competent, and culturally-aware individuals.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The rise of international tourism over the last few decades has been a phenomenon of unprecedented scale. While some argue that this boom has created more problems than benefits, it is undeniable that flourishing tourism can have a profoundly positive impact on the local economy. On one hand, the influx of tourists can put a strain on local resources, lead to overcrowding, and result in environmental degradation. Moreover, the cultural homogenization that often accompanies mass tourism can threaten the unique character and identity of a place.On the other hand, a well-managed tourism industry can be a powerful engine of economic growth and development. When tourists visit a new destination, they bring with them a surge of revenue that can be invested in local infrastructure, services, and businesses. This can lead to the creation of new jobs, the stimulation of entrepreneurship, and the improvement of living standards for local residents. Furthermore, a thriving tourism sector can also promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, fostering greater appreciation and respect for diverse customs and traditions.In many cases, the economic benefits of tourism can be substantial. For example, in destinations like Bali or Phuket, tourism has enabled local communities to develop and prosper, with many residents able to improve their livelihoods through tourism-related activities. Additionally, tourism can also promote the preservation of cultural heritage sites and natural wonders, as these become valuable attractions that draw visitors from around the world. In conclusion, while the rapid growth of international tourism does pose challenges, its potential to energize local economies and promote cultural exchange should not be underestimated. With careful planning and management, tourism can be a rewarding and sustainable sector that brings numerous benefits to destinations around the globe.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The advent of television has led to a significant shift in the way people spend their leisure time. While watching TV can be a entertaining and relaxing activity, it is a very passive action that does not engage the mind or promote physical activity. As such, it is not an activity that should be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. Excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to a range of health problems, including obesity and decreased cognitive function.On the other hand, activities that promote creativity, cooperation, and competition have been shown to have a positive impact on children's development. Engaging in activities such as sports, art, music, or debate, helps children develop important life skills, as they learn to work together, think critically, and solve problems. These activities also foster a sense of achievement and self-confidence, as children strive to improve and compete with their peers.Research has consistently shown that children who participate in such activities tend to perform significantly better in general terms. They exhibit improved academic performance, better social skills, and enhanced emotional intelligence. Moreover, these activities help children develop a growth mindset, as they learn to view challenges as opportunities for growth and development, rather than threats to their ego. In contrast, excessive TV watching can lead to a narrow and passive worldview, where children are merely consumers of information, rather than active participants in the learning process.In conclusion, while watching TV can be a fun and entertaining activity, it is not an activity that should be promoted as a primary source of leisure time. Instead, activities that promote creativity, cooperation, and competition should be encouraged, as they have a proven track record of promoting positive development and achievement in children. By engaging in these activities, children can develop the skills and mindset necessary to succeed in all areas of life, and grow into capable, confident, and well-rounded individuals.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The concept of working or studying from home has sparked a debate among individuals, with some considering it an advantage, while others view it as a disadvantage. On one hand, the flexibility and comfort of working or studying from home can boost productivity and motivation. However, on the other hand, some employers argue that working in isolation can have negative consequences.One of the primary concerns is that employees who work from home tend to spend a significant amount of time communicating with colleagues via phone or email. This can lead to a delay in response times and ultimately harm an employee's deliverables. The lack of face-to-face interaction and instant communication can hinder the collaborative process and reduce overall efficiency. Furthermore, teachers also believe that students who study from home can be at a disadvantage. Without the opportunity to clarify doubts and ask questions instantly, students may struggle to understand complex topics, leading to frustration and decreased academic performance.These factors can significantly affect individuals who work or study from home. The absence of immediate feedback and guidance can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Moreover, the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life can result in distractions and decreased motivation. While working or studying from home may offer some benefits, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks and find ways to mitigate them. By implementing strategies such as regular virtual meetings, open communication channels, and structured schedules, individuals can minimize the negative effects and maximize the advantages of working or studying from home. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the benefits of flexibility with the need for collaboration and guidance is crucial for success.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The advent of international tourism has brought about a myriad of effects on the social fabric of societies worldwide. On one hand, it has been observed to cause tension between individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. The influx of tourists can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, stemming from differences in customs, traditions, and languages. For instance, a tourist's unawareness of local norms and practices can inadvertently offend the host community, leading to strained relationships.On the other hand, international tourism also plays a pivotal role in fostering understanding and bridging the cultural divide between people from different walks of life. When conflicts or debates arise, individuals are compelled to engage in dialogue and make an effort to comprehend each other's perspectives. This process of mutual discovery can lead to a deeper appreciation and respect for the cultural nuances that distinguish one community from another. As people from different cultures interact and share their experiences, they begin to break down stereotypes and misconceptions, paving the way for more harmonious relationships.The attempt to understand each other after conflicts or debates is a crucial aspect of this process. It encourages active listening, empathy, and open-mindedness, all of which are essential for fruitful cross-cultural exchanges. Through such interactions, individuals can gain valuable insights into the historical, social, and political contexts that shape the beliefs and practices of different cultures. Ultimately, international tourism has the potential to serve as a catalyst for global understanding and peace, as it brings people together and facilitates the exchange of ideas and perspectives. By embracing the opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue and understanding that tourism presents, we can work towards a more tolerant, compassionate, and interconnected world.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The notion that celebrities are recognized solely for their glamorous lifestyle, rather than their professional accomplishments, is a prevalent one. Indeed, some celebrities do tend to prioritize showcasing their lavish lives and personas to the public, often overshadowing their actual work. Social media platforms, in particular, have created an environment where celebrities can curate a image-focused narrative, leaving their fans to admire and aspire to their luxurious lifestyles.However, it is essential to acknowledge that not all celebrities fit this mold. Many use their platforms to promote positivity, inspire, and lead young people in the right direction. These individuals recognize the influence they wield and choose to utilize it for the betterment of society. By sharing their passions, values, and philanthropic endeavors, they demonstrate to their fans that true success extends beyond material possessions and fame. They showcase the importance of hard work, dedication, and using one's platform for the greater good.Celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Angelina Jolie and others have been using their influenc to make a positive impact on the world. For instance, they have been involved in various charitable causes, such as environmental conservation, education, and humanitarian aid. Their commitment to creating meaningful change serves as a powerful example to young people, encouraging them to prioritize making a positive difference in the world. By highlighting the good work of these celebrities, we can shift the focus from mere glamour to the impactful contributions they make, and inspire a new generation of leaders and change-makers. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize and celebrate the celebrities who are using their influence to make a positive impact, and to encourage others to follow in their footsteps.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;The advent of television has revolutionized the way we acquire knowledge and entertainment. As an immense source of information, TV offers a wide range of educational programs that can aid pupils in learning and developing various skills. By watching TV, students can gain insight into different subjects, cultures, and ways of life, thereby broadening their perspective and fostering curiosity. Moreover, programs like documentaries, science shows, and historical dramas can supplement their academic learning, making complex concepts more engaging and easier to comprehend.However, allowing students to watch TV at both school and home can have an adverse impact on their overall growth. Excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, eye strain, and other health issues. Furthermore, it can distract students from their academic responsibilities, such as homework and studying, ultimately affecting their performance in school. Additionally, TV can also expose students to inappropriate content, such as violence, profanity, and mature themes, which can have a negative influence on their young minds.Moreover, excessive TV watching can also hinder students' social and emotional development. It can limit their interaction with family and friends, leading to social isolation and decreased communication skills. Moreover, it can also reduce their creativity, imagination, and problem-solving skills, as they spend more time watching others' ideas rather than generating their own. Therefore, while TV can be a valuable resource for learning, it is essential for parents and educators to monitor and limit students' TV watching, ensuring that it does not interfere with their physical, emotional, and academic growth. By striking a balance between TV watching and other activities, students can reap the benefits of TV while maintaining a healthy and well-rounded lifestyle.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The notion that older workers are inferior to their younger counterparts is a widely debated topic. One of the primary reasons for this disparity is the unchanged paradigm of older workers. Their unresponsiveness to new ideas and technologies can be attributed to their taste for monotony and safe ideology. They often prefer to stick to traditional methods and approaches, which can hinder innovation and progress.In contrast, younger workers are more open to change and are eager to adopt new technologies and strategies. This flexibility and adaptability enable them to stay ahead of the curve and drive growth in their respective fields. Furthermore, knowledge is a key factor that contributes to the success of young workers. They are more likely to have undergone recent training and education,On the other hand, older workers often rely on their experience and traditional knowledge, which may not be sufficient in today's fast-paced and rapidly changing work environment. While experience is valuable, it is no substitute for the latest knowledge and skills. Young workers, on the other hand, are more likely to have undergone recent training and education, which equips them with the skills and expertise necessary to excel in their chosen field.In conclusion, the unchanged paradigm of older workers, combined with their taste for monotony and safe ideology, can make them less competitive than their younger counterparts. Knowledge is a key factor that can help young workers outrank the elderly, as it enables them to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and strategies. As such, it is essential for organizations to prioritize the development and training of their workforce, to ensure that they remain competitive and innovative in an ever-changing world. By doing so, they can tap into the energy and creativity of their young workers, and stay ahead of the curve in their respective industries.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The advent of machines has sparked a heated debate about their impact on human health. On one hand, some individuals argue that the usage of machines is detrimental to human health. Their reasoning is that machines decrease the amount of physical work done by people, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and a range of associated health problems. When people rely too heavily on machines, they may engage in less physical activity, which can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and other health issues. Furthermore, prolonged periods of inactivity can also lead to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.On the other hand, many people believe that using machines has numerous benefits that outweigh the potential drawbacks. One of the primary advantages of machines is that they make work easier and less time-consuming. With the help of machines, people can complete tasks more efficiently and effectively, freeing up time for other activities. For instance, household chores such as laundry and cleaning can be done quickly and effortlessly with the aid of machines, allowing individuals to pursue other interests and hobbies. Additionally, machines can also reduce the physical strain and fatigue associated with manual labor, making it possible for people to work for longer periods without exhaustion.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of machines on human health, it is also important to acknowledge the benefits they bring. By striking a balance between machine usage and physical activity, individuals can reap the advantages of machines while maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Ultimately, the key to maximizing the benefits of machines is to use them judiciously and incorporate regular exercise and physical activity into daily routines. By doing so, people can enjoy the convenience and efficiency of machines while also protecting their physical and mental well-being.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;The notion that conventional things will eventually cease to exist and should be eliminated has gained significant traction in recent times. However,,assistant, I strongly disagree with this perspective. In my opinion, traditional skills and ways of life are an integral part of a culture's value and identity. These unique customs and practices distinguish one country from another, making each nation distinct and special.The preservation of conventional ways is not only a matter of cultural heritage but also a source of national pride. People feel a deep sense of pride and belonging when they are connected to their traditional roots. This sense of pride motivates individuals to reserve and pass on conventions to future generations, ensuring their continuation and evolution. For instance, traditional festivals, clothing, and cuisine are all examples of conventions that bring people together and foster a sense of community and shared identity.Moreover, conventional skills and ways of life often possess inherent value and wisdom that has been refined over time. Many traditional practices, such as craftsmanship, agriculture, and storytelling, embody techniques and knowledge that have been perfected through generations of trial and error. These skills not only provide a sense of continuity with the past but also offer valuable lessons and insights that can inform and enrich our modern lives.In conclusion, I firmly believe that conventional things should not be eliminated. Instead, they should be cherished, preserved, and allowed to evolve alongside modern innovations. By doing so, we can ensure that the unique cultural identities of nations are maintained, and the sense of pride and belonging that comes with them is preserved for future generations. Ultimately, the coexistence of traditional and modern ways of life is essential for creating a rich, diverse, and vibrant cultural landscape that celebrates the best of both worlds.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots, where people from diverse backgrounds and cultures come together to live, work, and thrive. However, this diversity and growth have led to a major problem that plagues many urban areas: traffic overload. The issue of traffic congestion, caused by overpopulation, has aroused the interest of many city planners, who are seeking innovative solutions to alleviate this burden on urban infrastructure.One of the primary causes of traffic overload is the reliance on personal vehicles, which clog roads and highways, leading to frustrating delays and decreased air quality. To mitigate this issue, city planners can still opt for non-personal vehicle solutions, such as public transportation systems, cycling infrastructure, and pedestrian-friendly walkways. By investing in these alternatives, cities can reduce the number of cars on the road, decreasing congestion and promoting a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly urban environment.Another strategy that city planners can employ is the exploitation of suburb areas. By developing suburban regions and providing incentives for businesses and residents to relocate there, cities can reduce the population density in urban centers, thereby decreasing the demand for transportation in these areas. Additionally, suburb areas can be designed with green spaces, parks, and other recreational facilities, making them attractive options for people who want to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. By adopting these strategies, city planners can create more livable, sustainable, and efficient urban environments, where people can thrive and enjoy a high quality of life. Ultimately, the key to solving traffic overload lies in thinking creatively and outside the box, and city planners who are willing to explore new solutions will be the ones to create the cities of the future.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;"The influence of media and celebrities on young people is a widespread phenomenon that has sparked intense debate. It is widely acknowledged that the constant exposure to celebrities and their lifestyles can have a profound impact on the youth. In fact, it is agreed upon that following celebrities can be detrimental to the well-being of young individuals. This essay will delve into the effects of celebrity worship on the health and personality of young people, highlighting the potential dangers associated with it.One of the primary concerns is the impact on the physical and mental health of young people. Celebrities often promote unrealistic beauty standards, with many young individuals striving to emulate their idols. This can lead to unhealthy habits, such as extreme dieting or exercise regimes, in an attempt to achieve the ""perfect"" body. Furthermore, the constant bombardment of airbrushed images and flawless skin can perpetuate low self-esteem and body dissatisfaction among young people. The pressure to conform to societal beauty standards can have severe consequences, including eating disorders, anxiety, and depression.Moreover, the influence of celebrities can also shape the personality and behavior of young people. The glorification of materialism, promiscuity, and rebellious behavior can lead to a distorted view of what is acceptable and desirable. Young individuals may feel pressured to adopt these traits in order to fit in or gain social acceptance, potentially leading to a decline in moral values and an increase in reckless behavior. The cult-like following of celebrities can also foster an unhealthy obsession, with young people becoming fixated on their idol's every move, rather than focusing on their own personal growth and development. In conclusion, the influence of celebrities on young people is a pressing concern, with potential dangers to both their physical and mental health, as well as their personality and behavior. It is essential for parents, educators, and the media to promote a balanced and realistic view of celebrity culture, encouraging young people to develop a positive and healthy relationship with the media and its icons."
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The issue of gender equality has been a topic of discussion for many years, with the primary goal of achieving an equal proportion of developing human resources. Efforts have been made to address the disparities between men and women in various fields, and significant progress has been made in recent years. One notable development is the increasing number of institutions that strive to maintain a balance between the number of male and female students in various courses.Many educational institutions have implemented policies to ensure that they accept an equal number of male and female students, promoting a more diverse and inclusive learning environment. This approach has been particularly effective in fields that were previously dominated by one gender,. As a result, the proportion of women in these fields has been rising steadily over the years, demonstrating a shift towards greater equality.The rising proportion of women in many parts of the world is a testament to the progress being made towards achieving gender equality. This trend is evident in various sectors, including education, employment, and leadership positions. The increasing number of women in these areas not only contributes to a more balanced representation of genders but also brings diverse perspectives and ideas to the table. Furthermore, it serves as a motivation for younger generations, encouraging them to pursue their goals and ambitions without being limited by gender stereotypes.In conclusion, the efforts to address gender issues and achieve an equal proportion of developing human resources have yielded positive results. The increasing proportion of women in various fields and the commitment of institutions to maintain a balanced intake of male and female students are significant steps towards realizing gender equality. Continued support and advocacy for gender equality are essential to build on this progress and create a more equitable society for all.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;The practice of smoking has been universally condemned as a shameful and lethal habit. People around the world have recognized the detrimental effects of smoking, not only on the smoker themselves, but also on those around them. One of the most significant concerns is the harm caused to passive smokers, who involuntarily inhale the toxic fumes emitted by smokers. This secondary smoke exposure can lead to serious health hazards, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.Given the risks associated with smoking, it is only logical that measures be taken to protect the health and well-being of non-smokers. One effective way to do this is to prohibit smoking in public places, such as bus and railway stations. These areas are often crowded and enclosed, making them particularly hazardous for passive smokers. By banning smoking in these locations, we can significantly reduce the exposure of non-smokers to second-hand smoke, and thereby minimize the risk of smoking-related health problems.Moreover, prohibiting smoking in public places can also help to reduce the social acceptance of smoking, and ultimately, discourage people from taking up the habit. When smoking is allowed in public, it can create a false impression that it is a safe and acceptable practice. By restricting smoking to private areas, we can help to relegate it to the margins of society, where it belongs. In conclusion, the dangers of smoking, both to smokers and non-smokers, make a compelling case for prohibiting the practice in public places. It is our collective responsibility to protect the health and well-being of all members of society, and banning smoking in public areas is a crucial step towards achieving this goal.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;"The impact of tourism on local economies and environments has been a topic of debate in recent years. Some argue that tourism is a major contributor to domestic economic distortion, as it can lead to an influx of external investment, causing prices to rise and local businesses to struggle. Additionally, tourism has been linked to environmental devastation, as the increased foot traffic and construction of tourist facilities can result in the destruction of natural habitats and pollution. Furthermore, the exploitation of tourist destinations can lead to irreparable damage, as local cultures and ways of life are disrupted and eroded.However, in my opinion, the negative effects of tourism can be mitigated by combining it with educational initiatives. By incorporating teaching and learning processes into tourism, the industry can be transformed into a force for good. Educational tourism, or ""edutourism,"" can promote cross-cultural understanding, environmental awareness, and economic sustainability. By teaching tourists about the local culture, history, and ecology of a destination, they can develop a deeper appreciation and respect for the place they are visiting. This, in turn, can lead to more responsible and sustainable tourist practices.Moreover, edutourism can provide economic benefits to local communities, while also promoting environmental conservation and cultural preservation. By supporting local educational initiatives and community-based tourism projects, tourists can contribute to the well-being of the destination, rather than exploiting it. In conclusion, the combination of tourism and teaching processes is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonious relationship between humans and their surroundings. By promoting edutourism, we can create a more sustainable and responsible tourism industry, one that benefits both the local community and the tourist, while preserving the beauty and integrity of the destination."
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The advent of information technology (IT) over the last 20 years has revolutionized various aspects of our lives, leading to significant improvements in living standards and work efficiency. The widespread adoption of IT has enabled rapid access to information, enhanced communication, and streamlined processes, thereby increasing productivity and efficiency. As a result, people have been able to enjoy better healthcare, education, and entertainment, among other benefits.However, it is also believed that the evolution of IT has a darker side. With the rapid pace of development, IT seems to have turned its users into its slaves. People have become increasingly dependent on technology, spending excessive amounts of time staring at screens, scrolling through social media, and responding to emails. This has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, a rise in stress levels, and a sense of perpetual connectedness that can be overwhelming.Moreover, the constant stream of information and notifications can be distracting, causing people to lose focus and become less productive. The pressure to stay connected and respond immediately has created a culture of instant gratification, where people expect quick answers and solutions. This can lead to a lack of deep thinking, critical analysis, and meaningful relationships. Furthermore, the addiction to IT can also have negative impacts on physical and mental health, such as sleep deprivation, eye strain, and decreased attention span.In conclusion, while IT has undoubtedly improved our lives and work efficiency, its rapid evolution has also created a culture of dependency and slavery. It is essential to strike a balance between harnessing the benefits of IT and maintaining a healthy and meaningful relationship with technology. By being mindful of our IT usage and setting boundaries, we can avoid becoming slaves to technology and instead, use it as a tool to enhance our lives and productivity.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;In recent years, there has been a significant surge in the number of individuals adopting a vegetarian lifestyle. This trend is largely attributed to the numerous health benefits associated with a plant-based diet. The primary reason for the rising popularity of vegetarianism is the perceived health improvement it offers. A well-planned vegetarian diet provides all the necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals required for optimal health, leading to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.In addition to health benefits, religious beliefs also play a significant role in the adoption of a vegetarian diet. Many religious traditions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, advocate for a vegetarian lifestyle, emphasizing the importance of compassion and non-violence towards all living beings. Followers of these faiths often choose a vegetarian diet as a way to align their eating habits with their spiritual values, promoting a sense of inner peace and harmony with nature.The combination of health benefits and religious influences has contributed to the growing popularity of vegetarianism. As people become more aware of the advantages of a plant-based diet, they are making conscious choices to adopt a lifestyle that not only improves their physical well-being but also resonates with their spiritual and moral principles. Moreover, the increasing availability of vegetarian options in restaurants and grocery stores has made it easier for individuals to incorporate more plant-based meals into their daily routine.In conclusion, the rapid increase in the number of vegetarians in recent years can be attributed to the dual factors of health improvement and religious beliefs. As the world becomes more health-conscious and spiritually aware, it is likely that the trend towards vegetarianism will continue to grow, promoting a more compassionate and sustainable lifestyle for individuals and the planet as a whole.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The advent of technological advancements has undoubtedly transformed the fabric of modern society. As countries embrace these developments, it is inevitable that they will be accompanied by the acquisition of modern skills and the adoption of new lifestyles. People will be equipped with the latest tools and techniques, enabling them to navigate the complexities of the digital age with ease. Moreover, the emergence of new technologies will also lead to a shift in cultural and social norms, as individuals adapt to the changing landscape.However, from my perspective, it is crucial to note that the integration of technology will not necessarily lead to the erosion of traditional values and practices. Rather, what can be expected is a change in the role of tradition, but not its disappearance from society. Tradition will continue to play a vital part in shaping the identity and heritage of a community, but its expression and manifestation may evolve to accommodate the changing times. For instance, cultural festivals and rituals may incorporate modern elements, such as digital performances or social media campaigns, while still retaining their essence and significance.In conclusion, the interplay between technological advancements and traditional practices will likely result in a blend of modernity and heritage. As societies navigate this intersection, it is essential to recognize the value of preserving tradition, while also embracing the opportunities presented by technological progress. By striking a balance between the two, countries can ensure that their cultural identities remain vibrant and relevant, even as they forge ahead into the digital age. Ultimately, the coexistence of tradition and technology will give rise to a unique and dynamic societal landscape, where modern skills and lifestyles complement, rather than replace, the timeless wisdom of tradition.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;The establishment of zoos has long been a topic of debate, with many arguing that they are inhumane and serve no purpose. However, it is essential to consider the educational benefits that zoos provide, particularly in the context of learning and research. Zoos offer a unique opportunity for learners to engage with real and vivid materials, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the natural world.At a higher level, university students can greatly benefit from conducting biological research in zoos. By studying live animals and collecting practical statistics, students can gain valuable insights into the behavior, physiology, and ecology of various species. This hands-on experience is invaluable, as it provides students with data and observations that would be difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise. Moreover, zoos can serve as a hub for scientific inquiry, fostering a culture of research and discovery among students and academics alike.In the face of globalization, which has led to the encroachment upon natural habitats, zoos play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity and promoting conservation efforts. As natural habitats are destroyed or fragmented, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species, allowing them to thrive and multiply. Furthermore, zoos can serve as a platform for raising awareness about the impact of human activities on the environment and the importance of conservation. By supporting zoos and their conservation efforts, we can work towards mitigating the negative effects of globalization on the natural world. In conclusion, zoos are a vital means of education, research, and conservation, and their importance cannot be overstated in the face of growing environmental concerns.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";Despite the various arguments presented, I still strongly believe that the government should make a concerted effort to preserve minority languages. The formation of a language is a process that unfolds over thousands of years, involving the collective efforts and experiences of generations. As such, it deserves to be respected and preserved for its inherent cultural and historical value.Language is one of the essential factors that create the differences and unique cultures that enrich our world. It is a fundamental aspect of a community's identity, encompassing its traditions, customs, and beliefs. The loss of a language is, therefore, a loss of cultural heritage, leading to a less diverse and less vibrant global community. By preserving minority languages, governments can play a crucial role in safeguarding the cultural richness of their nations and the world at large.Furthermore, preserving minority languages is not just about cultural preservation but also about promoting inclusivity and diversity. When minority languages are valued and supported, the communities that speak them feel recognized and respected. This can foster a sense of belonging and pride among these communities, contributing to social cohesion and stability.In conclusion, the preservation of minority languages is a cause that warrants serious attention and action from governments worldwide. It is a matter of cultural preservation, diversity promotion, and respect for the unique histories and identities of minority communities. By taking steps to preserve these languages, we are not only safeguarding cultural heritage but also contributing to a more inclusive and diverse world. Therefore, I firmly believe that the preservation of minority languages should be a priority for governments, as it is crucial for maintaining the rich tapestry of cultures that make our world a more interesting and varied place.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The age-old adage ""prevention is better than cure"" is a fundamental principle in medicine that emphasizes the importance of taking proactive measures to avoid illnesses rather than treating them after they occur. This saying is particularly relevant in today's world, where the burden of diseases is not only a health concern but also an economic one. It will be of significant economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases, as the cost of treatment and management of chronic conditions can be overwhelming.One of the most effective ways to prevent diseases is through education, particularly among children. Teaching children about the importance of balanced diets and nutritious food can go a long way in shaping their eating habits and promoting healthy lifestyles. Conversely, educating them about harmful food and substances can help them make informed choices and avoid unhealthy habits. By instilling these values from a young age, children are more likely to develop healthy habits that will benefit them throughout their lives.Furthermore, a preventive approach to health can also reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. By promoting healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and avoiding harmful substances, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of developing these conditions. In addition, preventive measures such as vaccinations, screenings, and regular check-ups can also help detect diseases early, when they are more treatable.In conclusion, the saying ""prevention is better than cure"" is a timeless wisdom that holds significant relevance in today's world. By prioritizing preventive measures, particularly through education and promoting healthy lifestyles, we can reduce the burden of diseases, promote economic benefits, and ultimately lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. As a society, it is our responsibility to impart this knowledge to the next generation, starting with children, to create a healthier and more sustainable future."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that outstanding academic students are the only ones eligible for university admission has sparked intense debate. On one hand, it is undeniable that these students possess an intellectual advantage that would enable them to excel in academic studies. Their exceptional academic performance is a testament to their hard work and dedication, and it is only fitting that they are given the opportunity to pursue higher education.However, university is not just a hub for academic studies, but also a platform to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Many students who may not excel academically may possess exceptional artistic or creative abilities that can be honed and refined in a university setting. Moreover, university life provides students with the opportunity to develop essential soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are invaluable in the real world.The restriction of university admission to only outstanding academic students has both pros and cons. On the one hand, it ensures that only the most capable students are admitted, which can lead to a more competitive and rigorous academic environment. On the other hand, it may deprive talented individuals who do not excel academically of the opportunity to develop their skills and reach their full potential. In conclusion, while outstanding academic students are undoubtedly eligible for university admission due to their intellectual advantage, it is essential to consider the broader benefits of university education, including the development of artistic talent and soft skills. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to university admission is necessary, one that balances academic merit with other essential skills and talents. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and diverse university community that fosters the growth and development of all students, regardless of their academic background.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;The upbringing and education of children is a crucial aspect of their development, and they are primarily influenced by two important individuals: their parents and teachers. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that teachers play a significant role in children's education in some aspects. Parents are the first point of contact for children, and they provide them with basic values and principles. However, teachers have a more profound impact on children's educational and social development. Teachers are trained professionals who have the expertise and experience to guide children in their academic pursuits. They create a structured and supportive learning environment that fosters intellectual curiosity and creativity in children. Moreover, teachers often have a more objective perspective on a child's abilities and potential, which enables them to provide constructive feedback and guidance. They are also better equipped to identify and address any learning difficulties or behavioral issues that a child may be experiencing. In addition, teachers often have a significant influence on shaping a child's social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are essential for their future success.While parents provide emotional support and a stable home environment, teachers provide children with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in life. In some aspects, teachers are better suited to provide children with the education they need, as they have the training and expertise to do so. Therefore, I firmly believe that teachers play a vital role in children's education, and their influence should not be underestimated. By working together, parents and teachers can provide children with a well-rounded education that prepares them for future challenges and opportunities.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;The notion that salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers has sparked a heated debate. While it is undeniable that financial compensation plays a significant role in career choices, I firmly believe that there are other aspects that should be considered equally important as income when selecting a job. On one hand, I agree that money is essential in order to meet human basic needs. A decent salary ensures that individuals can provide for themselves and their families, covering necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Moreover, a good income can also offer a sense of security and stability, which is crucial for overall well-being.However, I also believe that there are other factors that should be taken into account when choosing a career. For instance, personal fulfillment, work-life balance, and job satisfaction are equally important considerations. A job that provides a sense of purpose and alignment with one's values and passions can lead to a more satisfying and meaningful career. Additionally, factors such as opportunities for growth and development, work environment, and social impact should also be weighed against salary. A career that offers a sense of community, autonomy, and opportunities for advancement can be more rewarding than one that solely prioritizes financial gain. Furthermore, research has shown that once basic needs are met, additional income does not necessarily lead to greater happiness or satisfaction. Therefore, while salary is an important consideration, it should not be the sole determining factor in career choices. By considering a range of aspects, individuals can make more informed decisions that align with their values, goals, and aspirations, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful career.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The widespread use of cars has had a profoundly negative impact on both the environment and the economy. One of the most significant issues is the wasteful consumption of oil, which is a finite and non-renewable resource. The excessive reliance on cars has led to a surge in oil demand, resulting in severe pressure on the environment due to the emission of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases.Moreover, the high cost of petrol has a ripple effect on the economy, particularly on the prices of essential products. As the cost of petrol increases, the prices of necessities such as rice, meat, and vegetables also rise. This is because the transportation costs of these products are directly tied to the cost of fuel, making them more expensive for consumers. This can have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, who spend a larger proportion of their income on basic necessities.Furthermore, countries that rely heavily on oil imports are also vulnerable to political and financial pressures from oil-exporting nations. The dependence on imported oil can limit a country's autonomy and make it more susceptible to fluctuations in global oil prices. This can lead to a loss of economic sovereignty and make a country more beholden to the interests of oil-producing nations. In conclusion, the widespread use of cars has significant environmental and economic drawbacks, including wasteful oil consumption, higher prices for essential products, and increased dependence on oil-exporting countries. It is essential for governments and individuals to explore alternative modes of transportation and energy sources to mitigate these negative impacts and create a more sustainable future. By doing so, we can reduce our reliance on oil and promote economic and environmental stability.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The rising number of street criminals has led to a significant concern in today's society, the carrying of guns by police forces. This trend has sparked a heated debate among individuals, with some assuming that it reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. One of the primary reasons for this assumption is that the increased presence of firearms can escalate situations, potentially leading to more violent confrontations. When police officers are armed, it can create a sense of tension and hostility, which may provoke criminals to react more aggressively, thereby increasing the likelihood of violent outcomes.Another reason for this concern is that the normalization of gun-carrying by police officers can contribute to a culture of violence and aggression. If the police, who are supposed to be the guardians of law and order, are seen carrying guns, it can send a message to the public that violence is an acceptable means of resolving conflicts. This can have a ripple effect, leading to an increase in violent behavior among the general population. Furthermore, the presence of guns can also lead to a sense of mistrust and fear among the public, particularly in communities that have historically had tense relationships with law enforcement.In conclusion, the trend of police officers carrying guns in response to the increasing number of street criminals is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While it may be intended as a means of maintaining law and order, it can also have unintended consequences, such as escalating violence and contributing to a culture of aggression. It is essential to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of this trend and to explore alternative solutions that prioritize de-escalation and community building. By doing so, we can work towards creating a safer and more harmonious society for all.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;The integration of technology in education has been a widely debated topic, with many believing that it has a positive impact on students' scholastic performances. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this notion, and I attribute the benefits of technology to two primary factors: richness and convenience.On one hand, the richness of technology provides students with a vast array of educational resources that were previously inaccessible. The internet, for instance, offers a wealth of information on various subjects, allowing students to explore topics in-depth and gain a deeper understanding of complex concepts. Moreover, educational software and apps provide interactive and engaging learning experiences, making learning a more enjoyable and effective process. This richness of technology enables students to access a wide range of learning materials, thereby broadening their knowledge and improving their academic performance.On the other hand, the convenience of technology allows students to learn at their own pace and convenience. With the help of online resources, students can access learning materials anytime and anywhere, eliminating the need for physical classrooms and rigid schedules. This flexibility enables students to manage their time more effectively, balance their academic and personal responsibilities, and ultimately, achieve better academic outcomes. Furthermore, technology also facilitates communication and collaboration among students, teachers, and peers, promoting a sense of community and support that is essential for academic success.In conclusion, the richness and convenience of technology are two significant factors that contribute to the improvement of students' scholastic performances. By providing access to a wealth of educational resources and facilitating flexible learning, technology has revolutionized the way students learn and interact with educational materials. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future of education and empowering students to achieve their full potential.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The advent of technological development has been a highly debated topic in recent years. While some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives, I personally disagree with this view. On the one hand, those who oppose technological advancement argue that it leads to a sedentary lifestyle, social isolation, and decreased face-to-face interaction. They also claim that it results in job losses, as automation replaces human labor, and contributes to environmental pollution through e-waste and energy consumption.On the other hand, proponents of technological development, like myself, believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. Technological advancements have improved our quality of life in numerous ways, such as enhancing communication, facilitating access to information, and increasing productivity. The internet, for instance, has enabled people to connect with others across the globe, fostering global understanding and cooperation. Moreover, technology has led to significant breakthroughs in the medical field, enabling early diagnosis, effective treatment, and improved patient care.In my opinion, the benefits of technological development are undeniable. While it is true that there are some negative consequences, I believe that these can be mitigated through responsible innovation and regulation. By adopting sustainable practices and designing technology with social responsibility in mind, we can minimize its adverse effects. Furthermore, technological development has the potential to address some of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change, poverty, and inequality. Therefore, rather than viewing technological development as a curse, I firmly believe that it is a powerful tool that can be harnessed to create a better future for all.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The exposure of violent content to children through television programs has become a pressing concern that requires immediate attention. In order to tackle this problem effectively, governments must take a firm stance by prohibiting any type of violent content in all children's television programs. This is essential because most youngsters, due to their mental immaturity, are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. As a result, they may emulate the violent behaviors they see on TV, which can lead to a range of negative consequences, including increased aggression and a desensitization to violence.However, it is also important to consider the potential implications of such a restriction on television content. If governments were to implement a blanket ban on violent content across all TV shows and movies, it would undoubtedly be met with resistance from some quarters. This is because such a move would be seen as a violation of adults' civil liberties, who have the right to choose what they watch. Adults are deemed capable of making informed decisions about the content they consume, and restricting their access to certain types of programming could be viewed as an overreach of government authority.Therefore, a balanced approach is necessary. Governments should focus on protecting children from violent content, while also respecting the rights of adults to make their own choices about what they watch. This could involve implementing stricter age ratings and ensuring that children's programming is thoroughly vetted for violent content. By taking such measures, governments can help to safeguard the well-being of children, while also upholding the principles of freedom of choice and expression that are fundamental to a healthy and democratic society. Ultimately, finding this balance is crucial to addressing the issue of violent content in television programming effectively.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The rise in criminality has become a pressing concern globally, with the number of criminal incidents increasing rapidly. Some individuals attribute this surge to the frequent use of guns by law enforcement agencies to resolve criminal situations. However, I strongly disagree with this assertion. In my opinion, the escalating violence and criminality can be attributed to a multitude of factors beyond just the use of firearms by police.Firstly, societal and economic factors play a significant role in contributing to the rise in criminality. Poverty, unemployment, and social inequality can drive individuals to engage in criminal activities out of desperation or as a means to survive. Additionally, the breakdown of family structures and lack of community support can also lead to an increase in criminal behavior. These underlying issues are often overlooked in the debate about criminality, and addressing them is crucial to mitigating the problem.Moreover, the role of mental health and substance abuse cannot be understated. Unaddressed mental health issues and drug addiction can lead individuals to commit crimes that they might not otherwise engage in. The lack of accessible mental health services and rehabilitation programs exacerbates this issue, leading to a cycle of crime and recidivism.While the use of guns by police may contribute to the perception of violence, it is not the primary cause of the increase in criminality. A comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of crime, including socioeconomic factors, mental health, and substance abuse, is necessary to effectively reduce criminality. By focusing on these broader issues, we can work towards creating safer, more supportive communities that discourage criminal behavior and foster a more peaceful society. Ultimately, a multifaceted strategy is required to tackle the complex issue of rising criminality, rather than solely focusing on the methods used by law enforcement.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";The influence of classmates on individual achievements is a pivotal aspect of a student's academic journey. Classmates play a significant role in shaping a student's motivation, their approach to learning, and ultimately, their academic performance. From a psychological perspective, the dynamic among classmates is particularly noteworthy. They create a competitive atmosphere that incentivizes children to strive for excellence. This environment, where peers challenge and motivate one another, is instrumental in fostering academic growth and personal development.When students perceive their classmates as performing better academically, it often instills a sense of competition. This feeling of being subordinate to their peers can exert enormous pressure on children's academic performances. However, this pressure is not inherently negative. Rather, it can serve as a powerful motivator, pushing students to work harder, to learn more, and to achieve higher. The psychological impact of being surrounded by peers who are similarly striving for academic success can elevate a student's aspirations and standards.Moreover, the influence of classmates extends beyond mere academic competition. They provide emotional support, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, thereby enriching the learning experience. In a classroom setting, positive interactions among classmates can enhance a student's sense of belonging and motivation, further contributing to their academic achievements. The social and emotional learning that occurs among peers is just as valuable as the formal instruction provided by teachers.In conclusion, the role of classmates in influencing individual achievements cannot be overstated. They are a constant source of motivation, support, and healthy competition. By recognizing the importance of classmates, educators and parents can foster environments that encourage positive peer interactions, thereby maximizing the potential for academic success and personal growth. The psychological dynamics at play among classmates underscore the significance of nurturing a supportive and competitive learning environment, one that encourages students to strive for their best in the company of their peers.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The world is witnessing a significant shift in population dynamics, with more and more people migrating to big cities in search of better opportunities. Today, metropolitan areas are hub of economic growth, cultural diversity, and modern amenities, making them an attractive destination for people from all walks of life. However, while life in these cities has its advantages, such as access to quality education, healthcare, and entertainment, it also has a darker side that can have severe consequences on people's health.One of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before is environmental pollution. The high concentration of vehicles, industries, and construction activities in urban areas leads to a significant increase in air, water, and noise pollution. This, in turn, can cause a range of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and even mental health issues. The poor air quality in cities can exacerbate existing health conditions, such as asthma, and also increase the risk of lung cancer and other diseases. Furthermore, the lack of green spaces and recreational areas in cities can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, diabetes, and other lifestyle-related diseases.In addition to environmental pollution, the fast-paced and stressful lifestyle in cities can also take a toll on people's mental health. The pressure to keep up with the demands of city life, combined with the lack of social support and community bonding, can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Therefore, while cities offer many benefits, it is essential to acknowledge the negative impact of urbanization on people's health and take measures to mitigate these effects. By investing in clean energy, green infrastructure, and community development, we can make cities healthier and more sustainable places to live.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The debate surrounding the arming of policemen has sparked intense discussion, with some arguing that it can lead to an increase in violence within society. However, this perspective overlooks a crucial aspect: the primary source of gun violence stems from illegally obtained firearms. It is imperative for governments seeking to control crime in their communities to focus on managing the actions of individuals rather than the tools used in violent crimes.The premise that allowing policemen to carry firearms will escalate violence is based on a flawed assumption that the presence of more guns inherently leads to more violence. Yet, empirical evidence suggests that the bulk of gun violence is perpetrated with weapons that are obtained through illicit means. This implies that the root cause of violence is not the availability of firearms to law enforcement, but rather the societal factors and illegal activities that lead to the proliferation of illegal weapons.Therefore, if a government aims to curb crime, it should concentrate on addressing the underlying issues that drive individuals to engage in violent behavior, as well as implement stringent measures to curb the illegal firearms trade. This could include community outreach programs,eduction and job creation initiatives to deter criminal activity, alongside robust law enforcement strategies to combat illegal weapon trafficking.In conclusion, while concerns about the potential for increased violence with armed police officers are understandable, they do not align with the evidence that most gun violence is committed with illegally obtained guns. Governments seeking to reduce crime should prioritize managing the root causes of violence and illegal weapon distribution, rather than the tools used by law enforcement. By doing so, they can more effectively create safer, more secure communities for their citizens.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;In many developing countries, a significant challenge persists - the inability of numerous families to afford education for their children. This limitation hinders the progress of these nations, as education is a crucial factor in development. However, it's essential to redefine what development through education entails. It's not solely about producing a country full of doctors, lawyers, or engineers, although these professionals are vital to a nation's growth.Development through education means fostering a population that is well-informed, capable of critical thinking, and empowered to make sound judgments. A well-informed individual can act sensibly in their daily life, contributing positively to their community. They can understand the importance of health, hygiene, and environmental conservation, leading to better living standards. They can also participate in the political process, making informed decisions that impact the future of their country.Moreover, education equips people with the skills to adapt to changing circumstances, innovate, and solve problems creatively. It promotes social cohesion, tolerance, and respect for diversity, all of which are essential for a stable and progressive society. In essence, the goal of education in developing countries should be to create a broadly knowledgeable and thoughtful populace, capable of contributing to their nation's advancement in multifaceted ways.By prioritizing access to education and recognizing its broader benefits, developing countries can unlock the potential of their populations. This, in turn, can lead to sustainable development, improved quality of life, and a brighter future for generations to come. In conclusion, education is the cornerstone of development, and its impact extends far beyond the production of specialized professionals, influencing every aspect of society and contributing to the well-being of individuals and communities alike.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The Influence of Celebrities on Adolescents: A Nuanced PerspectiveIn recent years, there has been a growing concern that adolescents are being negatively influenced by individuals who have gained fame solely due to their wealth and luxurious lifestyle. However, this notion oversimplifies the complexity of the issue. The young generation of today is remarkably conscious of the importance of positive lifestyles and is well-equipped with essential life skills. As a result, it is challenging to influence them with superficial or talent-less role models.The contemporary youth is discerning and astute, making it difficult for individuals without genuine talent or achievements to garner their admiration. The celebrity world is not easily accessible to those who lack substance, and the notion that one can become famous solely based on wealth is a misconception. While it is true that some individuals may gain temporary fame due to their affluent lifestyle,Furthermore, the young generation is exposed to a wide range of positive role models who have achieved success through hard work, dedication, and passion. These individuals, such as athletes, artists, and entrepreneurs, inspire and motivate adolescents to strive for their goals and pursue their passions. The influence of these positive role models far outweighs the impact of those who are famous solely for their wealth.In conclusion, the idea that adolescents are being negatively influenced by untalented celebrities is an oversimplification of the issue. The young generation of today is conscious, discerning, and equipped with essential life skills, making it challenging for individuals without genuine talent or achievements to have a lasting impact. Instead, positive role models who have achieved success through hard work and dedication are inspiring and motivating adolescents to pursue their goals and strive for excellence.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The widespread use of mobile phones among people of all ages has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in the 21st century. While mobile phones are undoubtedly a great invention, offering numerous benefits and conveniences, I firmly believe that their excessive use has led to several problems in our society. One of the most significant concerns is the adverse impact on our social skills.Spending too much time on mobile phones can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for developing and maintaining social skills. When individuals are constantly glued to their screens, they miss out on opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations, express emotions, and build empathy. As a result, people may become less adept at navigating complex social situations, communicating effectively, and forming deep, lasting relationships. Furthermore, the rise of social media has also contributed to the erosion of social skills, as people increasingly rely on digital platforms to interact with others, rather than engaging in person.The consequences of this trend are far-reaching and can have a profound impact on mental health, relationships, and community cohesion. For instance, excessive mobile phone use has been linked to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, the lack of social skills can also hinder personal and professional development, as effective communication and interpersonal skills are highly valued in most careers. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between mobile phone use and social interaction, ensuring that we do not sacrifice our social skills at the altar of technological advancement. By being mindful of our mobile phone use and making a conscious effort to engage in face-to-face interactions, we can mitigate the adverse effects of mobile phone use and nurture healthier, more meaningful relationships.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The notion that the government and large corporations are solely responsible for protecting the environment, and that ordinary citizens have no role to play, is a misguided one. While it is true that addressing certain environmental issues requires substantial budgets and advanced technologies, which may be beyond the capabilities of individual citizens, this does not mean that ordinary people are exempt from contributing to environmental conservation.On the contrary, the participation of ordinary people in environmental protection efforts is not only possible but also essential. Simple actions such as recycling, using public transport, or reducing energy consumption can collectively make a significant difference. Moreover, individuals can support organizations and initiatives that work towards environmental protection by volunteering, donating, or spreading awareness about environmental issues.Furthermore, the improvement of the environment is not just a moral or ethical obligation, but it also has direct benefits for the people involved. For instance, living in a cleaner, greener environment can improve health outcomes, enhance quality of life, and even boost local economies through eco-tourism and sustainable practices. Therefore, by participating in environmental protection, ordinary citizens are not only contributing to a global cause but also improving their own living conditions and those of their communities.In conclusion, while the government and big firms have a significant responsibility towards environmental protection due to their capacity to implement large-scale solutions, ordinary citizens also have a vital role to play. Through their daily choices and actions, individuals can contribute to solving environmental problems and benefit from the positive outcomes of their efforts. It is a collective responsibility that requires the engagement of all sectors of society to effectively protect and preserve the environment for future generations.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The portrayal of crime in the media has become a significant concern in today's society. A great deal of crime coverage is often biased, exaggerated, or even fraudulent, leading to a distorted view of reality. This sensationalized reporting only serves to terrorize communities, leaving law-abiding citizens increasingly apprehensive about crime. The constant bombardment of graphic details and alarming statistics can create a sense of fear and unease, making people feel vulnerable and anxious.Moreover, detailed reports of crimes can have an unintended consequence: providing potential criminals with instructive learning materials. By broadcasting the methods and tactics used by perpetrators, the media may inadvertently be offering a roadmap for those seeking to engage in similar unlawful activities. This information would be difficult to obtain otherwise, and its dissemination can ultimately contribute to an increase in criminal behavior.If the media continues to report on criminal details without any prevention or regulation, the consequences could be severe. Unlawful behavior may escalate, and social harmony could be disrupted. The constant exposure to crime stories can desensitize people to the gravity of these acts, leading to a breakdown in community cohesion and trust. Furthermore, the fear and mistrust generated by excessive crime reporting can lead to the erosion of social bonds, causing individuals to become more isolated and less likely to cooperate with law enforcement.In conclusion, the media's approach to crime reporting needs to be reevaluated. Rather than sensationalizing and exploiting crime stories for the sake of ratings, the media should prioritize responsible reporting that promotes public awareness without compromising public safety. By adopting a more balanced and restrained approach to crime coverage, the media can help mitigate the negative consequences of excessive reporting and contribute to the maintenance of social harmony.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In this era of modern technology, where digital tools and keyboards dominate our daily lives, the significance of teaching handwriting to children is often overlooked. Many people assume that with the convenience of modern facilities, handwriting has become an outdated skill. However, this assumption couldn't be further from the truth. Handwriting still holds a vital position in the learning process of students, and its importance should not be underestimated.Research has shown that handwriting plays a crucial role in the cognitive development of children. It enhances their motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and fine motor control. Moreover, handwriting is closely linked to the learning process, as it helps students to better retain information and understand complex concepts. When students write down notes and ideas by hand, they are more likely to remember and recall the information, leading to improved academic performance.On the other hand, poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. Illegible handwriting can lead to low grades, not because the student lacks knowledge, but because their handwriting makes it difficult for teachers to read and understand their work. Furthermore, poor handwriting can also affect a student's self-esteem and confidence, as they may feel embarrassed or frustrated about their inability to express themselves clearly through writing.In conclusion, despite the advancements in technology, teaching handwriting to children remains an essential part of their educational journey. It is not only a means of communication, but also a tool for learning and cognitive development. By emphasizing the importance of handwriting, we can help students to develop better writing skills, retain information more effectively, and ultimately achieve greater academic success. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to prioritize handwriting instruction in schools, ensuring that students have the foundation they need to succeed in their academic pursuits.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The debate surrounding private schooling and taxation has sparked intense discussion among policymakers and the general public. Some individuals who opt to send their children to private schools argue that the taxes they pay towards state education are unreasonable, given that their children do not utilize these services. They claim that by choosing private education, they are, in effect, contributing to reducing the economic disparity between the rich and the poor. This argument is based on the premise that by removing their children from the public school system, they are alleviating some of the financial burden on the state, thereby allowing more resources to be allocated to those who need them most.However, proponents of public education counter that offering tax reductions to parents whose children attend private schools would have unforeseen consequences. Primarily, such a policy could lead to a significant waste of public capital. The reasoning behind this is straightforward: public schools are funded through taxes, and if a substantial portion of the population is exempt from contributing to this fund due to their children attending private schools, the overall pool of money available for public education diminishes. This reduction in funding could result in decreased quality of education, larger class sizes, and fewer resources available to students in public schools.Moreover, the argument that affluent individuals are narrowing the gap between rich and poor by sending their children to private schools overlooks the broader societal implications. While it is true that their choice may reduce the demand on public schools, it does not address the systemic issues of inequality and access to quality education. In fact, by siphoning off resources and talent to private institutions, the gap between those who can afford private education and those who cannot may actually widen.In conclusion, the issue of taxation and private schooling is complex and multifaceted. While the intentions of affluent individuals may be to contribute to social equality, the potential consequences of tax reductions for private school attendees, including the waste of public capital, must be carefully considered. Policymakers must strive to find solutions that balance individual choice with the need to maintain a robust, equitable public education system.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The notion that governments should prioritize investing in public services over arts has sparked a heated debate. While many argue that public services are the only areas worthy of investment, I firmly believe that both public services and arts are deserving of financial support. In my opinion, the importance of public services cannot be overstated, and they are, without a doubt, worth every penny invested in them.Indispensable public services such as hospitals, schools, and transportation systems are the backbone of a functioning society. They provide essential support to citizens, ensuring their health, education, and overall well-being. Investing in these services is crucial, as they have a direct and significant impact on the quality of life of individuals and the community as a whole. For instance, well-funded hospitals can provide top-notch medical care, while adequately resourced schools can offer high-quality education, leading to a more informed and skilled population.However, arts such as music and theatre also play a vital role in the development and enrichment of a society. They provide a platform for self-expression, cultural preservation, and social commentary. Arts have the power to bring people together, foster creativity, and inspire positive change. Furthermore, a thriving arts scene can also contribute to the economic growth of a region, attracting tourists and generating revenue. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between investing in public services and arts, recognizing the value that both bring to the table.In conclusion, while public services are undoubtedly crucial, it is misguided to suggest that they are the only areas worthy of investment. Both public services and arts are essential components of a well-rounded and prosperous society. By allocating funds to both, governments can ensure the well-being of their citizens, while also nurturing creativity, culture, and economic growth. Ultimately, a balanced approach to investment will yield the most significant benefits for society as a whole.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The advent of modern technology has had a profound impact on traditional cultural practices. Many old, traditionally cultural things have long gone, lost to the relentless march of progress. The younger generation, in particular, has become increasingly enamored with the conveniences and connectivity offered by modern technology, leading to a decline in the practice and appreciation of traditional customs. For instance, the art of handwritten letters has given way to emails and text messages, while face-to-face storytelling has been replaced by social media updates.Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, technology has also made some significant contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. For example, digital archives and online museums have made it possible to preserve and showcase cultural artifacts, allowing people to access and learn about traditional cultures from all over the world. Additionally, social media platforms have provided a space for people to share and connect with their cultural heritage, facilitating the exchange of ideas and traditions across geographical boundaries.Moreover, technology has enabled the documentation and analysis of traditional practices, allowing researchers to study and understand the nuances of cultural expression. This has led to a greater appreciation and recognition of the importance of traditional cultures, and has inspired efforts to revitalize and promote cultural diversity. Overall, while modern technology has undoubtedly led to the erosion of some traditional cultural practices, it has also provided new opportunities for the preservation, study, and celebration of cultural heritage. By embracing the benefits of technology, we can work to ensure that traditional cultures continue to thrive and evolve in the modern world.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The debate surrounding university enrollment has sparked a discussion on whether institutions should strive for equal numbers of male and female students in each faculty. Proponents of this view argue that achieving a balance between the sexes in various fields is essential for promoting diversity and challenging traditional gender stereotypes. However, it is also observed that boys tend to dominate the science and technology fields, while girls often opt for literature, education, and arts.This trend is not surprising, given the societal norms and expectations that have historically influenced career choices. Many boys are drawn to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, where they can explore their interests in innovation and problem-solving. On the other hand, girls often gravitate towards the humanities, where they can develop their creative and communication skills. While these preferences are not absolute and many individuals defy these trends, they do reflect broader societal patterns.Rather than enforcing a rigid quota system, universities should focus on encouraging students to explore a wide range of subjects, regardless of their gender. By promoting STEM education among girls and humanities among boys, universities can help break down these gender barriers and foster a more inclusive learning environment. This approach can also lead to a more diverse and dynamic academic community, where students are empowered to pursue their passions and interests without being constrained by traditional gender expectations. Ultimately, the goal should be to create an environment where students can thrive and reach their full potential, regardless of their gender or field of study. By doing so, universities can play a vital role in shaping the next generation of leaders and innovators.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The lives of celebrities, such as movie stars, are often showcased in the media, highlighting their luxury lifestyles and glamorous relationships. However, this trend has a worrying impact on children, who are easily influenced by the perceived ease and extravagance of celebrity life. On the surface, it appears that celebrities have amassed wealth and fame without putting in much effort, giving children the misconception that hard work and dedication are not necessary to achieve success.This misconception can have severe consequences on children's attitudes towards education and their future careers. If they believe that wealth and fame can be attained without studying hard or working diligently, they may be less inclined to put in the effort required to succeed in school and beyond. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of entitlement, ultimately hindering their ability to reach their full potential.Moreover, not all celebrities are positive role models for children. Some may engage in questionable behavior, such as promoting materialism or indulging in scandalous relationships, which can have a corrosive influence on young minds. Children may emulate these behaviors, thinking that they are acceptable or desirable, which can lead to a decline in values and morals.

By doing so, we can encourage children to develop a strong work ethic and a positive attitude towards education, setting them up for success in their future endeavors.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state has evolved to encompass a wide range of social services, with healthcare being a fundamental aspect. Governments are now expected to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens, recognizing the intrinsic link between health and overall well-being. The welfare state's primary objective is to ensure that all citizens have access to quality healthcare, irrespective of their economic or social status.A crucial aspect of achieving this objective is health education. Educating the public about healthy habits, as well as the prevention and management of diseases, is essential in reducing the burden on the healthcare system. By investing in health education, governments can empower their citizens with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions about their health. This, only serves to underscore the importance of prioritizing education and prevention in the allocation of healthcare resources.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. This strategic allocation not only enhances the overall health and well-being of the population but also proves to be cost-effective in the long run. By focusing on prevention and education, governments can reduce the incidence of diseases and subsequently, the financial burden associated with treatment. This approach aligns with the principles of the welfare state, where the government plays a pivotal role in ensuring the health and well-being of its citizens. Ultimately, prioritizing education and prevention over treatment is a forward-thinking strategy that can lead to a healthier, more sustainable society.
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families. The responsibilities and challenges that come with parenthood can be overwhelming, but it is in these moments that the importance of both motherhood and fatherhood becomes evident. While the mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is as vital a part of healthy parenthood as motherhood.The role of mothers in child-rearing has traditionally been emphasized, and rightly so, given the nurturing and caregiving aspects that are often associated with motherhood. However, the role of fathers is equally significant. Fathers bring a unique set of skills, values, and perspectives to the parenting equation, which are crucial for the balanced development of a child. The presence of a father figure provides a sense of security, discipline, and often, a different parenting style that complements the mother's, creating a well-rounded upbringing for the child.In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child. Children learn by observing and imitating the behaviors, attitudes, and values of their parents. A father who is actively involved in his child's life provides a positive male role model, teaching important life skills, and promoting emotional and psychological well-being. The interaction between both parents also demonstrates healthy relationship dynamics, such as mutual respect, communication, and conflict resolution, which are vital lessons for children as they grow and develop their own relationships.Therefore, the balance and combination of motherhood and fatherhood are essential components of healthy parenthood. Both roles are intertwined and equally important, each contributing unique strengths and perspectives that together, provide a comprehensive and nurturing environment for children to grow and thrive. As such, it is crucial for societies to recognize and support the importance of fatherhood, alongside motherhood, to foster an environment where both parents can actively participate in and contribute to the development of their children.
