0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The debate about whether children should be taught to compete or co-operate has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. While some argue that competition is essential for driving economic growth and innovation, others believe that cooperation is more beneficial for children's development. In my opinion, I think that teaching children to co-operate is more important for them to become useful adults.Competition can effectively promote the development of the economy, as it encourages individuals to strive for excellence and innovate. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but rather the well-being and development of individual children. In this context, I believe that cooperation is more valuable. Through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills, such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution, which are significant in the future life of all students. These skills are essential for building strong relationships, working effectively in teams, and achieving common goals.Moreover, cooperation fosters a sense of community and mutual support, which is essential for children's emotional and social development. By working together towards a common goal, children can develop a sense of responsibility, trust, and respect for one another. In contrast, excessive competition can lead to stress, anxiety, and a focus on individual achievement over collective well-being. By teaching children to co-operate, we can help them develop into compassionate, empathetic, and socially responsible adults who are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern world. Therefore, I firmly believe that teaching children to co-operate is more beneficial for their development into useful and well-rounded adults.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The phenomenon of immigration has been on the rise over the last 50 years, with an increasing number of people migrating to other countries in search of better opportunities. As a result, the debate about how immigrants should integrate into their adopted countries has gained significant attention. While some people argue that immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behavior, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, immigrants should be able to sustain their cultural identities and maintain their origin values, even as they settle into their new lives.Maintaining one's cultural identity is a crucial aspect of integrating into a new multicultural environment. By preserving their cultural heritage, immigrants are able to hold onto a sense of belonging and connection to their roots. This, in turn, enables them to navigate their new surroundings with confidence and self-assurance. Moreover, retaining their cultural identity allows immigrants to contribute their unique perspectives and traditions to their adopted country, thereby enriching the cultural diversity of their new home.Rather than abandoning their old ways, immigrants should be encouraged to share their cultural practices and values with their new community. This not only helps to promote cross-cultural understanding but also fosters a sense of inclusivity and acceptance. By embracing their cultural differences, immigrants can build bridges between their old and new lives, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and integrated society. In conclusion, the ability to sustain their cultural identities is essential for immigrants to thrive in their adopted countries, and it is through this preservation of their origin values that they can truly emerge in their new multicultural environments.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The proliferation of international tourism has become a prominent phenomenon in recent years. The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages, and different cultures around the world. This trend has sparked a debate about its impact on destination countries. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations.On the one hand, international tourism has been a significant source of revenue for many countries, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. The influx of tourists has led to investments in infrastructure, hospitality, and services, which in turn has improved the standard of living for locals. Moreover, tourism has also played a crucial role in promoting cultural exchange and understanding between nations. By experiencing different cultures, tourists gain a deeper appreciation and respect for the diversity of human experiences.On the other hand, tourism has also been instrumental in preserving cultural heritage sites and natural wonders. Many countries have established national parks, museums, and conservation programs to protect their cultural and environmental assets, which are often funded by tourism revenues. Additionally, tourism has raised awareness about the importance of preserving these sites, prompting governments and local communities to take measures to conserve them for future generations. In conclusion, international tourism has been a positive trend, driving economic growth, cultural preservation, and environmental conservation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is likely that international tourism will continue to play a vital role in promoting global understanding and development.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The advent of international tourism has become a pervasive phenomenon in recent years, with the last 50 years witnessing a significant increase in the number of tourists traveling worldwide. This trend has sparked intense debate among individuals, with some hailing it as a positive development and others lamenting its consequences. In my opinion, international tourism is a double-edged sword, with both beneficial and detrimental effects.On the one hand, international tourism has the potential to foster cross-cultural understanding, promote economic growth, and create jobs in the hospitality and travel industries. Tourists bring with them a surge of revenue, which can be leveraged to develop local infrastructure, preserve cultural heritage, and support community development projects. Furthermore, it enables people to experience diverse customs, traditions, and ways of life, thereby broadening their perspectives and encouraging global citizenship.On the other hand, the unbridled growth of international tourism poses a significant threat to the very fabric of our cultural and environmental heritage. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future. The influx of tourists can lead to overcrowding, pollution, and degradation of natural habitats, ultimately compromising the integrity of these sites. It is imperative that governments and stakeholders adopt sustainable tourism practices, such as eco-tourism and responsible travel, to mitigate the adverse impacts of tourism and ensure the long-term preservation of our planet's precious resources.In conclusion, while international tourism presents numerous benefits, it is crucial that we acknowledge the potential risks and take proactive measures to conserve our cultural and environmental assets. By striking a balance between tourism development and conservation, we can harness the benefits of international tourism while safeguarding the integrity of our planet for future generations.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The idea of pursuing higher education overseas has become increasingly appealing to many students. However, the notion that staying home is better due to the challenges of living and studying in a foreign culture is a topic of debate. While some students prefer to study at home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas, I disagree with this statement.In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons. Firstly, the opportunity to immerse oneself in a new culture and language can greatly enhance one's communication and adaptability skills. By navigating everyday life in a foreign country, students develop resilience, independence, and self-reliance. Moreover, studying abroad provides access to a diverse range of academic programs, research opportunities, and renowned faculty that may not be available in one's home country.Furthermore, the experience of living and studying overseas broadens one's perspectives and understanding of different customs, values, and beliefs. This, in turn, can foster a more open-minded and tolerant individual, equipped to thrive in an increasingly globalized world. Additionally, the network of international contacts and friendships formed during this period can be invaluable in both personal and professional life.While it is true that studying overseas can present difficulties, such as homesickness, language barriers, and cultural differences, these challenges can be overcome with proper preparation, support, and a willingness to adapt. In conclusion, although staying home may seem like the easier option, the benefits of studying overseas far outweigh the difficulties, making it a rewarding and enriching experience that can shape one's future in profound ways.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;The trend of students attending schools or universities outside their home countries has become increasingly popular in recent years. There are several compelling reasons why students opt to study abroad. One of the primary motivations is the plethora of benefits that students gain from this experience, which extends beyond academics to personal and cultural growth.Personally, living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. Students who study abroad are forced to step out of their comfort zones, which helps them develop valuable life skills such as independence, self-reliance, and resilience. Moreover, the experience of navigating a new environment fosters a sense of confidence and self-assurance that is hard to replicate in a familiar setting.Academically, another important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. Foreign universities often offer unique courses, specializations, and teaching methods that may not be available in the student's home country. This exposure broadens their academic horizons, providing them with a competitive edge in their future careers. The opportunity to learn from renowned faculty, and engage with students from diverse backgrounds further enriches their academic journey.Culturally, studying abroad offers an immersive experience that allows students to dive deep into a new culture, learn its customs, traditions, and languages. This cross-cultural exchange not only enhances their understanding of the world but also makes them more empathetic and open-minded individuals. In conclusion, the decision to study abroad is driven by a combination of personal, academic, and cultural factors. Students gain a lot out of the experience, which shapes them into more adaptable, knowledgeable, and globally-minded individuals.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The rise in popularity of the internet has led to a significant shift in the way people consume information. Over the past few years, the internet has become an increasingly popular source of news and information, providing people with a vast and diverse range of topics to explore. As a result, many believe that newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. I partially agree with this statement.On one hand, some people still believe that newspapers can exist for a long time, due to their unique format and in-depth analysis of current events. They argue that newspapers offer a tangible and permanent record of history, which is often lost in the digital world. However, others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. With the internet, people can access news and information from anywhere in the world, at any time, making traditional newspapers seem slow and outdated.To obtain information, using the internet is indeed quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. With just a few clicks, people can access a vast array of news articles, blogs, and social media platforms, providing them with a wide range of perspectives and opinions. In contrast, newspapers are limited by their print schedule and geographic distribution, making them seem cumbersome and inefficient. Furthermore, online news sources are often updated in real-time, allowing readers to stay up-to-date with the latest developments, whereas newspapers are often outdated by the time they are published. Overall, while I believe that newspapers still have a niche role to play, I think that the rise of the internet will continue to erode their popularity, making them less relevant in the digital age.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";For successful development of a country, the allocation of a government's budget is a critical decision. Among the various sectors vying for funding, education stands out as a vital investment for a country's long-lasting prosperity. Education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in shaping the future of a nation. The question arises as to whether a government should prioritize the education of very young children over universities. In my opinion, a balanced approach that allocates resources to both young children's education and universities is essential for a country's development.Young children's education lays the foundation for future learning and development. It is during these early years that children develop crucial skills, values, and habits that influence their academic and personal growth. Therefore, it is reasonable to argue that a significant portion of the budget should be dedicated to this stage of education. However, investing solely in young children's education at the expense of universities would be misguided. Universities are the hubs of advanced learning, research, and innovation, all of which are critical for a country's economic and social advancement.Some may argue that universities can support themselves well through donations or by leveraging inventions and intellectual properties for financial gain. However, this argument is invalid as it overlooks the fundamental role of government funding in supporting equitable access to higher education and in driving research that benefits the public good. Universities require substantial funding to maintain high standards of education, to attract top talent, and to conduct research that addresses national and global challenges.In conclusion, while it is tempting to prioritize one sector of education over another, the truth is that both young children's education and universities are crucial on the path to a brighter future. A government should spare effort on both, recognizing that education at all levels fosters a civilized, innovative, and prosperous society. By allocating its budget wisely across the educational spectrum, a government can ensure a strong foundation for its youngest citizens while driving innovation and progress through its universities. This balanced approach is key to successful development and lasting prosperity.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";Living with roommates is a common experience for many students during their school or university years. Having a good roommate can make a significant difference in one's academic and personal life. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of a roommate is being considerate. A considerate roommate respects their fellow roommates' space, belongings, and habits. For instance, they would not play loud music late at night or borrow things without asking, showing that they care about their roommates' comfort and privacy. This quality is essential as it helps to maintain a harmonious and peaceful living environment, allowing students to focus on their studies and relax when needed.In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Effective communication helps to prevent misunderstandings and resolve conflicts that may arise. A good roommate should be able to express their needs, as well as listen to their roommates' concerns. For example, if a roommate is having a party, they should inform their fellow roommates in advance, so that they can make necessary arrangements. Similarly, if a roommate is feeling disturbed by noise or any other issue, they should be able to communicate their concerns in a respectful manner. This open communication helps to build trust and maintain a positive relationship among roommates.In conclusion, having considerate and communicative roommates can greatly enhance one's living experience. These qualities help to foster a supportive and respectful environment, which is crucial for students to succeed academically and personally. By being considerate and communicating effectively, roommates can build strong relationships, resolve issues amicably, and create a comfortable and enjoyable living space.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The debate on whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or investing in public transportation has been ongoing. In my opinion, governments should spend more money on improving public transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways. This investment is crucial for mitigating the problems associated with excessive reliance on personal vehicles.One of the primary reasons for prioritizing public transportation is that it helps alleviate traffic congestion. When more people use buses, trains, and subways, the number of cars and motorbikes on the roads significantly decreases, leading to smoother and faster commutes. This, in turn, enhances the overall quality of life for commuters and reduces the stress associated with daily travel.Moreover, investing in public transportation is an environmentally conscious decision. The more cars and motorbikes are on the roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged due to the increased emission of carbon and other harmful gases. By encouraging the use of public vehicles, governments can decrease the amount of carbon released into the air, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment. This is especially important considering the current global concerns about climate change and air pollution.In conclusion, the benefits of investing in public transportation far outweigh those of improving roads and highways. By spending more on buses, trains, and subways, governments can tackle traffic congestion, reduce air pollution, and promote a sustainable future. It is imperative for governments to recognize the importance of public transportation and allocate their budgets accordingly to create a better, more sustainable world for current and future generations.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";The debate about whether physical exercise should be a mandatory part of every school day or if students should focus solely on academic studies has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I strongly agree that physical exercise should be a required component of every school day. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises, which underscores the importance of incorporating physical activity into daily school routines.The more we practice, the better we feel, both physically and mentally. Regular physical exercise has been proven to enhance cognitive function, boost mood, and increase energy levels. Moreover, when we engage in outdoor and indoor sports, many aspects of our lives become clearer. Physical activity improves concentration, and discipline, which are essential skills for academic success. Additionally, team sports and group activities foster social skills, as students learn to work together towards a common goal, promoting teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities.From a broader perspective, the financial sustainability of a region largely depends on how healthy the population is. A healthy population is more productive, leading to a stronger economy. By incorporating physical exercise into school days, we are investing in the well-being and productivity of future generations. This, in turn, contributes to the economic prosperity of a region. In conclusion, the benefits of physical exercise are multifaceted, enhancing not only individual health and academic performance but also contributing to the economic sustainability of a community. Therefore, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day, laying the foundation for a healthier, more productive, and prosperous society.

12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The statement that technology has made children less creative than they were in the past has sparked a heated debate. Some people point out that excessive exposure to technology has stifled children's imagination and creativity, as they spend more time staring at screens than engaging in physical activities and creative play. While I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, such as limiting their outdoor play and social interactions, I strongly disagree with the notion that it has made them less creative.On the contrary, technology has inspired children to create new things and express themselves in innovative ways. With the vast array of digital tools and software available, children can now create art, music, and write stories with ease. They can also share their creations with a global audience, which can foster a sense of pride and motivation to continue creating. For instance, kids can make their own animations, videos, and video games, which requires a lot of imagination and problem-solving skills.Furthermore, technology has widened children's knowledge and broadened their perspectives. The internet has made it possible for children to access a vast amount of information and resources, which can spark their curiosity and inspire them to learn more. They can also connect with other children from different cultures and backgrounds, which can foster empathy, understanding, and creativity. Additionally, technology has enabled children to learn through interactive and engaging methods, such as educational apps and games, which can make learning a fun and enjoyable experience.In conclusion, while technology may have some negative effects on children, it has also opened up new avenues for creativity, self-expression, and learning. By leveraging technology in a balanced and responsible way, children can harness its power to unleash their imagination and creativity, and reach their full potential.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The notion that students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from other sources, such as the internet or television, is a widely debated topic. While some may argue that alternative sources are equally or even more effective, many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers play a pivotal role in shaping the foundational skills of students, teaching them how to write, read, and calculate since they are in kindergarten. These basic skills are the building blocks of all future learning, and teachers are best equipped to provide personalized guidance and feedback, helping students grasp complex concepts and develop critical thinking skills. Furthermore, teachers not only impart academic knowledge but also help students develop essential life skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.On the other hand, students gain most of their knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong. Teachers serve as role models and mentors, providing students with moral guidance and support, which is crucial for their emotional and psychological development. In a classroom setting, teachers can tailor their instruction to meet the diverse needs of their students, creating an inclusive and engaging learning environment that fosters intellectual curiosity and creativity. In conclusion, while alternative sources of learning, such as the internet and television, can supplement a student's education, they cannot replace the value of lessons with teachers. The personalized instruction, moral guidance, and foundational skills that teachers provide are essential for students' academic and personal growth. Therefore, I agree that students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from other sources.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The advent of email and text messaging has revolutionized the way people communicate, bringing about considerable changes in the way we interact with one another. With just a few clicks, individuals can send messages to anyone, anywhere in the world, making communication faster and more convenient than ever before. However, some people believe that these technological advancements may be contributing factors to the decline of written language. In this essay, I will discuss the extent to which I agree or disagree with this statement.On one hand, it is undeniable that email and text messaging have transformed the way we communicate. The brevity and informality of these platforms have led to a decline in the use of formal written language, with many individuals resorting to abbreviations, acronyms, and poor grammar. This has raised concerns among some that the art of written language is being eroded, and that the younger generation is not developing the necessary writing skills. However, I believe that this is not entirely the fault of email and text messaging, but rather a lack of attention to this matter from educators and individuals themselves.To mitigate this issue, it is essential that educators and individuals, especially the youths, pay more attention to the importance of written language. By emphasizing the value of proper grammar, spelling, and syntax, we can ensure that the next generation is equipped with the necessary skills to communicate effectively in both formal and informal settings. Furthermore, individuals should be encouraged to engage in activities that promote written language, such as writing workshops, journaling, and reading. By doing so, we can strike a balance between the convenience of email and text messaging, and the importance of preserving written language. Ultimately, I believe that with attention and effort, we can prevent the decline of written language and ensure that it continues to thrive in the digital age.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The debate on whether it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of human beings has been ongoing for a long time. Some people argue that it is wrong to exploit animals for human purposes, citing the cruelty and harm inflicted on them. On the other hand, I firmly believe that using animals for the benefit of human beings is necessary and justified, particularly when it comes to testing new medicines and foods.Increasing numbers of animal experiments are being conducted to ensure the safety and efficacy of new medicines and foods. For instance, before a new medicine is released to the market, it must undergo rigorous testing on animals to identify any potential harmful side effects. Similarly, new food products are tested on animals to ensure they are safe for human consumption. Some opponents of animal testing argue that it is cruel to animals and nature, and that alternative methods should be used instead. However, I believe that no sensible person will deny that testing on animals is a crucial step in the development of new medicines and foods.If the latest foods or medicines were allowed to be sold without testing on animals, it would be a dramatically cruel activity to humanity. The potential harm caused by untested products would be catastrophic, resulting in harm or even death to countless people. In contrast, animal testing ensures that new products are safe for human use, and has led to numerous breakthroughs in medical research and food safety. In conclusion, while I acknowledge the concerns of animal welfare, I firmly believe that using animals for the benefit of human beings, particularly in the context of testing new medicines and foods, is necessary and justified to protect human life and well-being.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;"The statement ""Television has destroyed communication among friends and family"" is a debatable topic. While television has its benefits, such as entertainment and education, I agree with the statement to a certain extent. One of the primary reasons is that most people do not have a plan or schedule for watching television, which can lead to excessive viewing. As a result, spending hours in front of the TV becomes a habitual and time-consuming task, leaving little time for social interaction with friends and family.Moreover, watching television programs can make us lazy, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Instead of engaging in physical activities or outdoor games with friends and family, people tend to spend their free time watching TV. This not only affects physical health but also hinders social communication and bonding. Furthermore, some television programs advertise negative activities, such as criminal behavior, violence, or unhealthy habits, which can have a detrimental impact on individuals, especially children and teenagers. The portrayal of such activities can desensitize viewers and promote anti-social behavior, further damaging relationships among friends and family.In conclusion, while television is a popular form of entertainment, it is essential to recognize its potential drawbacks. The lack of a viewing schedule, the promotion of a sedentary lifestyle, and the advertisement of negative activities are significant concerns. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to be mindful of their TV watching habits and strive for a balance between entertainment and social interaction. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative effects of television on communication among friends and family and promote healthier relationships."
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The idea that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach ensures gender equality,I partially agree with the statement that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. On one hand, universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders to promote fairness and equality. Women have proved themselves in every field, whether it is indoor or outdoor, showcasing their capabilities and breaking stereotypes. By accepting equal numbers of male and female students, universities can provide a balanced learning environment that fosters diversity and inclusion.On the other hand, the current job market plays a significant role in the decision-making process of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers, and the demand for specific skills can vary greatly between industries. For instance, fields like engineering and technology have traditionally been male-dominated, while fields like nursing and education have had more female representation. Imposing a strict equal acceptance policy might limit the universities' ability to respond to the changing needs of the job market.In conclusion, while promoting gender equality is crucial, a blanket policy of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject might not be practical. A more nuanced approach that considers the specific needs of each field and the job market would be more effective in ensuring that universities provide a fair and inclusive learning environment. By doing so, women can continue to prove themselves in every field, and universities can maintain their relevance in preparing students for the workforce.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The question of whether young adults should seek independence from their parents as soon as possible or live with their families for a longer period is a complex one. On one hand, many young adults yearn to break free from their parents' houses as soon as possible, driven by the desire to have no limits and to be independent. This longing for autonomy is understandable, as it allows them to make their own decisions and live life on their own terms. However, the eagerness to escape the familial nest often leads these young individuals to overlook the potential hardships that come with living away from home.In contrast, living with their families for a longer time can provide young adults with a more stable and secure environment. One of the significant advantages of living at home is the financial savings it offers. Without the burden of rent or mortgage, young adults can allocate their resources towards other important aspects of their lives, such as education or career development. Moreover, they are spared the worry of financial struggles or the challenges of getting along with a roommate, which can be a significant source of stress for many.Considering these points, it seems that living with their families for a longer period can be the more prudent choice for many young adults. While independence is an attractive prospect, the realities of living away from home can be daunting. By living at home, young adults can enjoy the benefits of financial security and family support, which can be invaluable as they navigate the challenges of young adulthood. Ultimately, the decision to seek independence or remain at home should be based on what is best for each individual's unique circumstances and priorities.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The issue of environmental cleanup has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that the government should be solely responsible, while others believe that companies and private individuals should bear the burden. In my opinion, the responsibility of cleaning up the environment, particularly air pollution, should be shared among private individuals, companies, and governments.Air pollution is a pressing issue that threatens the environment in numerous ways, such as causing holes in the ozone layer and exacerbating global heating. The detrimental effects of air pollution are far-reaching, making it imperative that collective action is taken to mitigate its impact. I firmly believe that more responsibility should be placed on private individuals and companies to pay for the cleanup of air pollution. This can be achieved through measures such as carbon taxing, where companies and individuals are levied for their carbon emissions, thereby incentivizing them to adopt cleaner and more sustainable practices.On the other hand, governments should play a regulatory role by restricting the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and businesses. This can be done by implementing and enforcing strict environmental laws and policies, such as banning single-use plastics, promoting renewable energy, and setting emission standards for industries. By doing so, governments can create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and discourages polluting activities. Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach that involves private individuals, companies, and governments is necessary to effectively combat air pollution and protect the environment. By sharing the responsibility, we can ensure a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for generations to come.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;"The notion that high sales of a product are primarily due to good advertising strategies has garnered significant attention in recent years. While I agree that advertising plays a crucial role in driving sales, I also believe that its effectiveness is limited if the product itself does not meet the needs and expectations of consumers.Advertising is undoubtedly the most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product. A well-crafted advertisement can capture the attention of potential buyers, create a desire for the product, and ultimately drive sales. However, it is not sufficient in itself to guarantee high sales. The product must also satisfy the needs of the consumers, whether it be in terms of quality, price, or functionality. If the product fails to deliver on its promises, no amount of advertising can compensate for its shortcomings.In other words, advertising can create a buzz around a product, but it is the product's inherent value that ultimately determines its success. Consumers are savvy and can see through misleading or exaggerated advertising claims. If a product does not meet their needs or expectations, they will not purchase it, regardless of how compelling the advertising may be. In conclusion, advertising is a reflection of the product's overall value proposition. Powerful advertisements can only take a product so far; it is the product's quality, relevance, and value that ultimately drive sales and customer loyalty. Therefore, while good advertising strategies are essential, they must be complemented by a product that truly satisfies the needs of consumers."
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The notion that a high percentage of young people attending university is beneficial to a country has sparked a heated debate. In this essay, I will analyze both views in order to come up with a fool-proof decision. On one hand, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. They argue that an overabundance of university graduates leads to a surplus of qualified individuals, resulting in unemployment and underemployment. This, in turn, can lead to a brain drain, as skilled workers are forced to seek opportunities abroad. Furthermore, the financial burden of university tuition fees can be overwhelming, causing students to accumulate significant debt.On the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge that is essential for a country's progress. University education fosters critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which are valuable assets in today's fast-paced and ever-changing job market. Additionally, universities play a vital role in driving innovation and research, leading to breakthroughs in various fields such as medicine, technology, and sustainability. By investing in university education, a country can reap long-term benefits, including a more skilled workforce, increased competitiveness, and economic growth.In my opinion, the benefits of a high percentage of young people attending university far outweigh the drawbacks. While it is true that university education can lead to unemployment, it is also a key driver of innovation, economic growth, and social mobility. To mitigate the risks of unemployment, governments and educational institutions can work together to ensure that university programs are tailored to meet the needs of the labor market, and that graduates are equipped with the skills and knowledge required to succeed in their chosen careers. Ultimately, a well-educated population is essential for a country's prosperity and competitiveness in the global economy.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;The popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience, but at the same time, a variety of problems as well. In this essay, I would like to analyze the social, medical, and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones in order to support my viewpoint that the problems of using mobile phones do indeed outweigh the benefits.Firstly, social problems are a significant concern. For instance, speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries, and hospitals, appears to be very impolite and offensive. This behavior can be disturbing to others and disrupt the peaceful environment of these places. Furthermore, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tool in examinations, which undermines the integrity of the education system. This not only affects the individual student but also the overall academic environment.In addition to social problems, mobile phones also pose medical risks. The radiation emitted by mobile phones has been linked to various health issues, including cancer and brain damage. Moreover, the constant use of mobile phones can lead to addiction, sleep deprivation, and decreased attention span. These medical problems can have severe long-term consequences, affecting not only the individual but also their loved ones.Technical problems, such as hacking and cyberbullying, are also prevalent. The ease of access to personal information through mobile phones has made it easier for hackers to steal sensitive data, leading to identity theft and financial loss. In conclusion, while mobile phones have made our lives more convenient, the social, medical, and technical problems associated with their use cannot be ignored. These problems have significant consequences, and therefore, it can be argued that the problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The use of computers has become an integral part of our daily lives, and children are no exception. While some people believe that using computers every day is beneficial for children, as it enhances their learning and cognitive skills, others think differently. In my opinion, I agree that using computers daily can have more negative than positive effects on children.On the one hand, some people think that computers are good for children and should be used daily, as they provide access to a wealth of educational resources and information. They argue that computers can aid in learning, improve problem-solving skills, and enhance creativity. However, I disagree with this perspective. In my opinion, using computers constantly has a bad influence on children's eyes, as prolonged screen time can lead to eye strain, dryness, and increased risk of myopia. Furthermore, children who spend excessive time playing games on computers can seriously lack communicating skills, as they interact more with screens than with people. This can hinder their ability to develop essential social skills, such as empathy, active listening, and conflict resolution.Moreover, excessive computer use can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, poor posture, and other health problems. Therefore, it is essential for parents and caregivers to monitor and limit computer use among children, ensuring a balance between screen time and other activities that promote physical and social development. In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool for learning, I firmly believe that using them every day can have more negative than positive effects on children, and it is crucial for parents to be aware of these risks and take steps to mitigate them.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The establishment of a large factory near our community has sparked intense debate among residents. While some argue that the factory will bring numerous benefits, others claim that it will have devastating consequences. However, after careful consideration, I firmly believe that the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.On the one hand, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. The influx of new jobs will not only provide stable income for numerous families but also attract new businesses and services to the area. This, in turn, will increase the community's purchasing power, boosting the local economy. Furthermore, the factory will also contribute to the community's tax revenue, enabling the local government to invest in public facilities and services.On the other hand, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. As our community continues to grow and industrialize, the demand for goods and services will increase, and factories will be necessary to meet this demand. Rather than resisting the construction of factories, we should focus on mitigating their negative impacts, such as pollution and environmental degradation. By implementing strict environmental regulations and investing in sustainable technologies, we can minimize the harmful effects of factories and ensure that they operate in an environmentally responsible manner.In conclusion, while the construction of a large factory near our community may have its drawbacks, the benefits it brings to the local economy and job market cannot be ignored. By addressing the environmental concerns associated with factories, we can ensure that they become a positive influence on our community, driving growth and prosperity while preserving the well-being of our residents.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The advent of easily prepared food has revolutionized the way we consume meals. With the rise of ready-to-eat meals,s, pre-packaged snacks, and meal delivery services, cooking has become more convenient than ever. However, this trend has a darker side. While prepared food may save us time and effort, it can also have negative consequences on our health and culinary skills.One of the primary concerns with prepared food is the utilization of artificial ingredients. Many pre-packaged meals contain preservatives, additives, and other synthetic substances that can have detrimental effects on our health. Furthermore, the nutritional value of these meals is often compromised, as they tend to be high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. By relying on prepared food, we may be ignoring the importance of nutrition and compromising our well-being.Moreover, the increased consumption of prepared food can modify our eating habits in undesirable ways. We may find ourselves gravitating towards convenient, but unhealthy options, rather than taking the time to prepare balanced meals. This can lead to a decline in cooking skills, as we rely more heavily on pre-packaged meals. The more prepared food we eat, the more cooking skills we lose. This is a troubling trend, as cooking is not only a vital life skill, but also a way to express creativity and connect with others.In conclusion, while prepared food may be convenient, it is not necessarily a good thing. The negative influences of artificial ingredients, compromised nutrition, and modified eating habits can have long-term consequences for our health and culinary abilities. As we move forward, it is essential to strike a balance between convenience and nutrition, and to prioritize cooking skills and healthy eating habits. By doing so, we can ensure that the ease of prepared food does not come at the expense of our well-being.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;"The notion that providing financial aid is the best and only way to assist developing countries is a topic of debate. While some argue that financial assistance is essential, many disagree, claiming that it is not the sole solution. I partially agree with the statement, as financial aid can be beneficial, but it is not the only means to support impoverished nations.On one hand, some developed countries and organizations, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank, are providing financial assistance to developing countries. This aid is often used to develop education, which is a crucial aspect of a country's growth. By analyzing the necessity of education in these countries, it becomes clear that financial aid can be a vital tool in supporting their development. The real objective of these supporters is to empower developing countries to become self-sufficient, and education is a key factor in achieving this goal.On the other hand, it is well acknowledged that ""there is no free lunch in the world."" This proverb suggests that everything comes with a cost or a condition. Financial aid often comes with strings attached, such as conditions that may not align with the recipient country's interests or values. Moreover, the reliance on financial aid can create dependency, rather than encouraging self-sustainability. Therefore, while financial aid can be beneficial, it is not the only solution, and other forms of assistance, such as technical expertise, capacity building, and trade agreements, should also be considered.In conclusion, while financial aid can be an effective means of supporting developing countries, it is not the only way to assist them. A more comprehensive approach, incorporating education, technical assistance, and trade, would be more beneficial in the long run. Ultimately, a combination of these methods, rather than solely relying on financial aid, would be the most effective way to support the development of impoverished nations."
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The statement that society should ban all forms of advertising because it has no purpose and causes damage is a topic of debate. While I understand the concerns, I disagree with a complete ban on advertising. On one hand, certain types of advertisements, such as those for alcohol, cigarettes, and goods and services with adult content, should indeed be prohibited. These ads can have a profoundly negative effect on children, influencing their behavior and values in harmful ways. The protection of children from such inappropriate content is crucial, and regulations should be in place to ensure that advertisements are suitable for all audiences, especially the young.On the other hand, advertising plays a significant role in promoting goods and services offered by companies, firms, and individuals. It is a key tool for businesses to reach their target markets, increase brand awareness, and ultimately drive sales. Many businesses rely heavily on advertising to compete in their respective markets. Furthermore, governments also utilize advertising to inform the public about important issues, promote public health campaigns, and encourage civic engagement. Advertising revenue is also vital for the media and entertainment industries, supporting the creation of content that informs, educates, and entertains the public.Instead of a complete ban, a more balanced approach would be to implement and enforce strict regulations on what can be advertised, to whom, and how. This would allow the benefits of advertising to be realized while minimizing its potential harm. Regulatory bodies should ensure that advertisements are truthful, not misleading, and suitable for their intended audience. By doing so, society can harness the economic and informational benefits of advertising while protecting vulnerable populations, such as children, from harmful influences. In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of advertising, a total ban is not the solution. Thoughtful regulation and oversight are needed to maximize the benefits of advertising for businesses, governments, and society as a whole.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The role of women in society has undergone significant changes over the years, and nowadays, there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. While some people believe that women should focus on household chores, I strongly believe that women should have the right to work and earn money. In recent years, employment discrimination based on gender has been largely eradicated, allowing married women to take up jobs on an equal footing with men.By pursuing a career, a married woman can contribute to the family income, enhancing the overall quality of life for her loved ones. Moreover, working outside the home provides opportunities for women to interact with the outer world, which helps to strengthen their character and showcase their capabilities. This, in turn, enables them to become more confident and independent individuals. Furthermore, working mothers set a good example for their children, teaching them the value of hard work, self-reliance, and the importance of pursuing their passions.In conclusion, I firmly believe that married women should have the opportunity to work and earn money. Not only does this benefit the family financially, but it also allows women to grow as individuals, develop their skills, and become role models for their children. As we continue to strive for gender equality, it is essential that we recognize the importance of women's participation in the workforce and provide them with the support and opportunities they need to succeed. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where women can thrive and reach their full potential.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The question of who should bear the cost of education has been a topic of debate for many years. In my opinion, the government has a responsibility to provide primary and secondary education to its citizens, as this is essential for the development of a country's human resources. However, when it comes to university education, I believe that students or their parents should pay for the fees.Primary and secondary education lays the foundation for future learning and is crucial for the intellectual and social development of individuals. It is the government's duty to ensure that all citizens have access to these levels of education, regardless of their financial background. On the other hand, university education is a choice that individuals make, and it is reasonable to expect them or their parents to bear the cost. University education is often specialized and prepares students for specific careers, and the benefits of higher education are largely personal.However, it is true that some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children's university fees, which could limit access to higher education for disadvantaged groups. Nevertheless, I don't think it is fair for the government to bear the entire cost of university education, as it has already been paying a significant amount of money for primary and secondary education. The government has limited resources, and it needs to prioritize its spending. By requiring students or their parents to pay for university fees, the government can allocate its resources more efficiently and ensure that primary and secondary education remains accessible to all. Ultimately, a balance needs to be struck between making higher education accessible and ensuring that the government's resources are used effectively.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888, and since then, the number of vehicles has skyrocketed, with an estimated 29 million on the roads by the year 2000. This staggering growth has sparked a heated debate about the need for alternative forms of transport and international laws to regulate car ownership and use. In this essay, I will examine the arguments for and against this proposition, and provide my stance on the matter.A great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation in recent years. Some state that the automobile is the most convenient mode of transportation, providing individuals with the freedom to travel wherever and whenever they please. However, others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution caused by the massive number of cars on the roads. In the following passages, several reasons will be described carefully to support the notion that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use.On the one hand, the environmental impact of car emissions is a significant concern. The pollution caused by vehicles contributes to climate change, air quality deterioration, and health problems. On the other hand, alternative forms of transport such as cycling, walking, and public transportation can greatly reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, thereby decreasing pollution and promoting a healthier environment. Furthermore, international laws can be implemented to regulate car ownership and use, such as taxing car owners, limiting the number of vehicles per household, and investing in public transportation infrastructure. By taking these measures, we can reduce our reliance on cars and create a more sustainable transportation system. Overall, I agree that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use, in order to mitigate the negative impacts of car dominance on our roads.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The debate on whether rich countries should provide financial help to poor countries has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, I strongly agree that rich countries should provide financial assistance to poor countries, as the positive effects of doing so far outweigh the potential side-effects. There are several compelling reasons to support this stance. Firstly, poor countries often struggle with a shortage of basic materials and facilities, which hinders their ability to start businesses and stimulate economic growth. By providing financial aid, rich countries can help bridge this gap, enabling poor countries to establish a foundation for development and eventually become self-sufficient. Secondly, aiding poor countries through campaigns and donations gives people in rich countries a chance to demonstrate consideration and empathy towards those in need. This not only fosters a sense of global community but also raises awareness about the disparities in living standards around the world. Thirdly, the aid campaigns might include practical benefits such as infrastructure development, education, and healthcare, which are essential for the overall well-being of a nation. By investing in these areas, rich countries can help poor countries build a stronger, more resilient society that is better equipped to handle future challenges. In conclusion, while there may be arguments against rich countries providing financial help to poor countries, I firmly believe that the benefits of doing so are substantial. By providing aid, rich countries can help alleviate poverty, promote economic development, and demonstrate global solidarity. Ultimately, the positive effects of financial aid to poor countries outweigh the potential drawbacks, making it a morally and economically justifiable pursuit.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";The phenomenon of globalization has been a topic of intense debate in recent years, with some hailing it as a harbinger of economic prosperity and others lamenting its negative consequences. While it is undeniable that globalization has a profoundly positive impact on the world's economics, I firmly believe that its negative side should not be overlooked.On the one hand, globalization has undoubtedly contributed to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. It has facilitated the exchange of goods, services, and ideas across borders, leading to unprecedented economic growth and development. Moreover, globalization has enabled the transfer of technology,,assistanttechnology, knowledge, and skills, thereby enhancing the overall standard of living and quality of life for millions of people around the world. Many believe that globalization has been a driving force behind the significant reduction in poverty and inequality, and has played a crucial role in shaping the modern world into a more interconnected and interdependent community.On the other hand, some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to the ethnic and religious values of people in their country. They argue that the influx of foreign cultures, ideas, and values has led to the erosion of traditional practices and customs, and has resulted in a loss of cultural identity. Furthermore, these critics contend that globalization has created economic disparities, with multinational corporations exploiting cheap labor and natural resources in developing countries, thereby exacerbating income inequality and social injustices. In addition, the homogenization of cultures and the dominance of western values have been seen as a menace to the diversity and richness of local cultures, leading to a loss of uniqueness and distinctiveness.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the numerous benefits of globalization, I also believe that its negative consequences should not be disregarded. It is essential to strike a balance between the economic benefits of globalization and the preservation of cultural diversity and national identity. By being aware of the potential drawbacks and taking steps to mitigate them, we can ensure that the process of globalization is more equitable, sustainable, and beneficial to all nations and communities.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate surrounding the duration of compulsory education has sparked intense discussion among educators, policymakers, and the general public. Many people believe that children should study at school to gain more knowledge that will prepare them better for their future. This perspective argues that education is a fundamental right and a critical component of personal and societal development. By staying in school, students can acquire a wide range of skills, including literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking, which are essential for success in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.Others, however, think that children who are not interested in academic pursuits may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. According to this viewpoint, forcing these students to remain in school can lead to disengagement, poor behavior, and a negative impact on their peers. Proponents of this approach argue that vocational training or apprenticeships can provide a more suitable alternative for students who are not academically inclined, allowing them to develop practical skills and enter the workforce earlier.Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that students have to be forced to study at schools. Education is a powerful tool that can break cycles of poverty, promote social mobility, and foster informed and active citizenship. By completing their education, students can expand their opportunities, develop a broader understanding of the world, and make more informed decisions about their future. Furthermore, many subjects taught in school, such as mathematics, science, and languages, provide a foundation for a wide range of careers and are essential for navigating an increasingly complex and technological society. Therefore, I believe that staying in school and acquiring a comprehensive education is crucial for the future success and well-being of students.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The notion that the high sales of popular consumer goods are a reflection of the power of advertising, rather than the real needs of society, is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people believe that advertisements manipulate consumers into buying unnecessary products that only look appealing on television, I disagree with this sentiment to a certain extent.On one hand, it is true that advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, creating a false sense of need among consumers. This can lead to people purchasing products that they do not truly require, simply because they have been convinced of their importance by clever marketing. However, it is also important to acknowledge the significant role that advertising plays in the economy. Advertisements introduce new products to the market, providing consumers with a wider range of choices and driving innovation. Furthermore, advertisements are often visually enjoyable, entertaining, and informative, making them a valuable part of modern media.In addition to their economic benefits, advertisements also serve as a platform for companies to showcase their products and compete with one another. This competition can lead to better quality products, and more affordable prices, ultimately benefiting the consumer. While it is true that some advertisements can be deceptive, it is also important to recognize the positive impact that they have on the economy and society as a whole. In conclusion, while advertising can be influential in shaping consumer demand, it is not the sole driver of sales, and its benefits to the economy and society should not be overlooked. Ultimately, a balanced perspective is necessary to fully understand the role of advertising in shaping consumer behavior.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The ownership of guns is a highly debated topic in today's society. Unlike other normal goods, guns are strictly controlled in most countries due to their potential to cause harm. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce gun control, as the consequences of unregulated gun ownership can be devastating. The rise in accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates are all compelling reasons to limit gun ownership. When guns are readily available, the risk of accidents, such as unintentional shootings, increases exponentially. Moreover, the ease of access to guns can turn minor disputes into fatal confrontations, contributing to the alarming rates of violent crime. Additionally, the presence of guns in households can also lead to a higher incidence of suicide, as it provides a lethal means to act on suicidal impulses.In light of these statistics, it is clear that guns are not a kind of normal good that should be freely available to the public. The potential risks and consequences associated with gun ownership far outweigh any perceived benefits. By limiting gun ownership, we can reduce the number of accidents, violent crimes, and suicides that occur each year. This, in turn, can create a safer and more secure society for everyone.In conclusion, considering the detrimental effects of unregulated gun ownership, I firmly support the idea that guns should be strictly limited. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that our society is protected from the harmful consequences of gun violence. By enforcing stricter gun control laws, we can take a crucial step towards creating a safer and more peaceful world. Ultimately, the limitation of gun ownership is a necessary measure to prevent unnecessary loss of life and promote the well-being of our communities.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a notion that warrants consideration. I agree with this opinion to a significant extent. International sporting events have the unique ability to bring nations together, even amidst political or ideological differences, thereby playing a crucial role in easing international tensions.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way, as aptly noted by Yang. The passion and pride that come with supporting one's national team can be a powerful force. Instead of this energy being directed towards conflict or hostility, it is channeled into cheering, fanfare, and sportsmanship. This controlled environment allows for the expression of national pride without the risk of escalating into something more dangerous or divisive.The football World Cup, for instance, is a global phenomenon that captures the attention of millions, creating a shared experience that transcends geographical boundaries. The camaraderie and sportsmanship displayed during such events often highlight the common humanity that exists beyond national differences. Furthermore, the interactions between fans of different countries, the exchange of cultures, and the mutual respect for the sport itself contribute to a sense of global community and understanding.In conclusion, while there are many factors at play in international relations, international sporting events undeniably serve as a platform for safely expressing national pride and easing tensions between nations. They provide a common ground where differences are momentarily set aside for the spirit of competition and sportsmanship. Therefore, such events are indeed essential in fostering global unity and patriotism in a safe and healthy manner.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The impact of technology on the socioeconomic divide between the rich and the poor has been a subject of debate in recent years. Some people consider that the range of technology available to the public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. However, I find it hard to agree with this opinion for several reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. This makes technology more accessible and affordable for people from all walks of life, regardless of their economic background. As a result, the digital divide between the rich and the poor is bridged, enabling everyone to have equal access to information, communication, and opportunities.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in living a more meaningful life. With the aid of technology, individuals can now work more efficiently, start their own businesses, and access various online educational resources, thereby improving their socio-economic status. This, in turn, contributes to reducing the gap between the rich and the poor.In conclusion, while some may argue that technology exacerbates the gap between the rich and the poor, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh its drawbacks. By making technology more affordable and increasing productivity, it provides opportunities for people to improve their lives and bridge the socioeconomic divide. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely to play an even more significant role in promoting equality and reducing the gap between the rich and the poor.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"The investment of governments in traveling to outer space has been a topic of debate for a long time. A lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, questioning the rationale behind spending billions of dollars on space travel when there are pressing issues on Earth that require immediate attention. However, in my opinion, the investment is reasonable and justified.On the other hand, there are some compelling reasons for human beings to travel to outer space. One of the most significant advantages of space exploration is the opportunity to gain new insights about our planet. For instance, the picture of planet Earth taken from outer space, known as the ""Blue Marble,"" proved that the Earth is indeed round, not flat, dispelling a long-held myth. By observing planet Earth from outer space, people can know more about the atmosphere of the planet, including its composition, temperature, and weather patterns. This information is crucial for understanding climate change, predicting natural disasters, and managing natural resources.Moreover, space exploration has led to numerous technological innovations that have improved our daily lives. The development of satellite communications, GPS technology, and memory foam are just a few examples of the many spin-off benefits of space research. Furthermore, space travel has the potential to unlock new resources, such as minerals and energy sources, which could support human civilization in the future. In conclusion, while the investment in space travel may seem excessive to some, I firmly believe that the benefits it brings to our understanding of the planet, technological advancements, and potential resources make it a worthwhile endeavor."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. The idea of teenagers having jobs while still students has sparked a heated debate. Although in some extents, having extra jobs are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. On the one hand, having a job can provide students with a sense of responsibility and independence, which are essential life skills. On the other hand, it is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved in extra jobs. This hands-on experience can help students to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. For instance, a business student working part-time in a company can apply the concepts learned in class to actual business scenarios, thereby enhancing their understanding and retention of the material.Moreover, having a job can also help students to develop important skills such as time management, teamwork, and communication. These skills are highly valued by employers and can give students a competitive edge in the job market after graduation. Additionally, earning their own money can also teach students the value of money and help them to manage their finances effectively. In conclusion, while there may be some drawbacks to students having extra jobs, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. By working part-time, students can gain practical experience, develop important skills, and become more independent and responsible individuals. As such, I think it is a good idea for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to institutions and organizations for short periods of unpaid work has become increasingly common in recent years. The purpose of this essay is to discuss the benefits that both students and organizations can derive from this activity. On the one hand, students can gain valuable work experience and skills that are not typically taught in a classroom setting. By working in a real-world environment, students can apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems, develop teamwork and communication skills, and build their professional network. Additionally, students can also gain a competitive edge in the job market as they can include their work experience in their resumes and cover letters. On the other hand, as for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. They do not have to pay the students, which can help reduce their operational costs. Moreover, companies can also benefit from the fresh perspectives and ideas that students can bring to the organization. Students are often more familiar with the latest technologies and trends, which can help companies stay up-to-date and competitive. Furthermore, hosting interns can also enhance a company's reputation and contribute to its corporate social responsibility, as it is seen as investing in the development of future professionals.In conclusion, the practice of sending students to work for companies without salaries can be beneficial to both students and organizations. While students can gain valuable work experience and skills, companies can save money, gain fresh perspectives, and enhance their reputation. Overall, this practice can be a win-win situation for both parties involved, and it is likely to continue and even expand in the future.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The notion that paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and increase their productivity has been a topic of debate among business leaders and human resource experts. The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In my opinion,A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places, as it gives employees a sense of recognition and appreciation for their hard work. When employees feel valued,However, I do not entirely agree that paying more money is the only possible motivation. There are other factors that can motivate employees to work harder and be more productive. For instance, a positive work environment, opportunities for growth and development, and a sense of purpose and autonomy can also drive employees to perform better. Moreover,In conclusion, while paying more money can be a significant motivator for employees, it is not the only possible way to increase productivity and hard work. Employers should consider a combination of financial and non-financial incentives to motivate their employees and create a positive and productive work environment. By doing so, employers can reap the benefits of a motivated and dedicated workforce, which can lead to increased job satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and ultimately, improved business performance.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;The statement that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is one that I strongly agree with. Large scale sports games have the unique ability to make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them be proud of their nation. This shift in focus can significantly contribute to easing tensions between nations, as people's attention is diverted from conflicts and directed towards the excitement and competition of the sporting event.Moreover, this can be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to peace. Sports have a way of transcending borders and linguistic barriers, bringing people from different nations together in a shared experience of excitement and suspense. For instance, during the World Cup, it is common to see fans from different countries gathered together, cheering and supporting their teams, momentarily forgetting about their differences. This shared passion for sports encourages people to display their national symbols, such as flags and jerseys, in a show of pride and unity. The display of national symbols in a sporting context is a safe and positive outlet for patriotic emotions, allowing people to express their national pride without it escalating into aggression or hostility. In conclusion, international sporting events play a vital role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions. By bringing people together and shifting their focus away from disputes, these events contribute to global peace and understanding, making them an essential part of our international calendar.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;I strongly agree with the opinion that government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. The major source of energy today is water, which is ironic given the widespread water shortages that plague many regions. Despite these shortages, many countries still rely heavily on water to generate electricity, often at the expense of other, more sustainable options. The sources most widely used currently to generate power, such as fossil fuels, release an extensive amount of harmful gases into the atmosphere, significantly contributing to global warming. This has severe consequences, including rising sea levels, melting of polar ice caps, and extreme weather events. It is imperative that governments take immediate action to mitigate these effects by promoting and investing in alternative sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and geothermal power. These alternative sources are not only more environmentally friendly but also have the potential to create new job opportunities and stimulate local economies. Moreover, they can reduce a country's reliance on finite resources, thereby enhancing energy security. Governments can encourage the adoption of these alternatives through incentives, subsidies, and regulatory frameworks that favor sustainable energy production. In conclusion, given the alarming rate of global warming and the limitations of traditional energy sources, it is crucial that governments prioritize the promotion of alternative energy sources. By doing so, they can ensure a more sustainable future, reduce the environmental footprint of energy production, and create economic benefits for their citizens. It is time for a paradigm shift in how we generate and consume energy, and governments must take the lead in this transition.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The issue of whether the government should provide direct financial help to unemployed individuals has sparked intense debate in recent years. Unemployment is clearly a global problem, affecting both developed and developing countries, and its consequences can be devastating for those who are struggling to make ends meet. However, the question remains as to who should bear the responsibility of supporting these individuals - the government or the individuals themselves.In my opinion, I tend to disagree with the statement that the government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. While it is undeniable that unemployment can be a crushing burden, I believe that it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help themselves out. This may seem like a harsh stance, but I firmly believe that individuals should take proactive steps to improve their own circumstances, such as acquiring new skills, seeking job training, or even starting their own businesses.Moreover, government handouts can often create a culture of dependency, where individuals rely solely on government support rather than taking initiative to improve their own lives. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a sense of entitlement, which can be detrimental to the individual's long-term prospects. Instead, governments could focus on creating an environment that fosters job creation, entrepreneurship, and innovation, thereby empowering individuals to take control of their own economic destinies. Ultimately, while the government has a role to play in supporting its citizens, I believe that the onus of responsibility lies with the individual to help themselves out of unemployment.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The role of a university has been a topic of debate among scholars and educators. Some argue that universities should focus on providing graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace, while others believe that the primary function of a university is to offer access to knowledge for its own sake. In my opinion, the main function of a university should be to provide access to knowledge, regardless of its practical applications.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to students. Instead, these must be made available when needed. This approach allows students to explore various fields of study and acquire knowledge without the pressure of meeting specific job requirements. By doing so, universities can foster a love for learning, encourage intellectual curiosity, and promote personal growth.Furthermore, a university's primary goal should be to educate students, not just to train them for a specific job. By focusing on providing access to knowledge, universities can help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, which are essential for success in any field. Additionally, this approach enables students to make informed decisions about their career paths and pursue their passions, rather than being limited to a specific profession.In conclusion, the main function of a university should be to provide access to knowledge, rather than solely focusing on preparing students for the workplace. By adopting this approach, universities can promote a culture of learning, intellectual freedom, and personal development, ultimately leading to a more well-rounded and educated society.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;I disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. While some critics argue that zoos are more likely to be a killer than a protector in protecting wild lives, the role of zoos in conservation and education cannot be overstated. One such critic argues that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in their natural habitat, thereby making zoos redundant. However, this perspective overlooks the fact that zoos play a crucial role in protecting endangered species and promoting awareness about the importance of conservation.Zoos provide a safe haven for animals that are threatened or endangered in their natural habitats. They also offer a platform for research and breeding programs, which are essential for the survival of many species. Moreover, zoos serve as educational institutions, providing people with an opportunity to learn about wildlife and the importance of conservation. By showcasing various species, zoos inspire visitors to take an interest in wildlife conservation and promote a culture of sustainability.Furthermore, zoos often collaborate with wildlife conservation organizations to develop and implement conservation strategies. They also participate in rehabilitation programs for injured or orphaned animals, which are later released back into their natural habitats. In addition, many zoos are involved in ex-situ conservation efforts, such as captive breeding programs, which help to increase the population of endangered species. Therefore, while the argument that strict laws can protect animals in their natural habitat is valid, it is not a substitute for the important work that zoos do in protecting and preserving wildlife. In conclusion, zoos do have a useful purpose and play a vital role in promoting conservation and protecting wildlife.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way we approach education, and while some argue that they cannot replace the traditional college or university experience, the benefits of online learning far outweigh the drawbacks. In my opinion, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities as it offers unparalleled convenience and accessibility.Distance-learning brings significant convenience for students worldwide, allowing them to access courses and degree programs that may not be available in their geographical location. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for working professionals, students with family commitments, or those living in remote areas. With the rise of online learning, students can now balance their academic pursuits with other responsibilities,Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing technology allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students, transcending geographical boundaries. This not only increases the reach of educational institutions but also enables students to interact with peers and instructors from diverse backgrounds, fostering a richer learning experience. Online platforms can also offer personalized learning experiences, with interactive modules and virtual labs, making complex concepts more engaging and easier to understand.In conclusion, while some may argue that distance-learning programs lack the interpersonal interactions of traditional classroom settings, overall, the advantages of online learning make it an indispensable tool in modern education. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that online learning will become even more sophisticated, offering students an increasingly immersive and effective learning experience. Therefore, I firmly believe that distance-learning programs are a valuable addition to traditional education and should be embraced by colleges and universities worldwide. By leveraging online-teaching, educational institutions can expand their reach, improve accessibility, and provide students with a flexible and high-quality learning experience.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technologies, such as mobile phones, e-mails, and internet chat programs like MSN Messenger, has brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. While some individuals have undoubtedly benefited from these innovations, others have not. In my opinion, the benefits of modern communication technology are not evenly distributed, and I partially agree that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits.On the one hand, modern communication technologies have opened up new avenues for social interaction, access to information, and economic opportunities. For instance, people can now stay connected with friends and family across geographical distances, access a vast array of information, and participate in global commerce. These benefits have been particularly pronounced for those with the means to afford and utilize these technologies effectively.On the other hand, opponents of modern communications claim that the benefits are limited to the more privileged segments of society. I agree with this assertion to a certain extent. In many parts of the world, particularly in rural or underdeveloped areas, access to modern communication technologies is limited due to infrastructural constraints or economic barriers. As a result, a significant portion of the global population remains disconnected from the benefits of modern communication, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have undoubtedly improved the lives of many, there remains a notable disparity in who benefits from these innovations. It is crucial to address the issues of access and equity to ensure that the benefits of modern communication technology are more universally accessible. Only then can we truly harness the full potential of these technologies to bridge gaps and foster a more connected and equitable world.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate surrounding the incorporation of music lessons in high school education has sparked intense discussion. While some people claim that music should be taught as a main subject in high schools, most people argue that it is essential to include music as a core part of the curriculum. On the other hand, others contend that music is an unnecessary subject and should, at the very least, be optional. To my mind, students are in high school to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects that will ultimately prepare them for their future careers. In this sense, making music a mandatory subject may seem like a diversion from the primary goal of education, which is to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary for their chosen professions. However, music education offers numerous benefits that can enhance a student's academic and personal development. Music lessons can improve cognitive skills, boost memory, and foster creativity and discipline. Moreover, music education can provide students with an outlet for self-expression and a means to develop their emotional intelligence. It can also broaden their cultural understanding and appreciation, which are essential components of a well-rounded education. In conclusion, while the importance of professional skills development cannot be overstated, I believe that music lessons can play a vital role in a student's overall development. Rather than being seen as a waste of time, music education should be viewed as a complementary subject that can enhance students' academic performance, personal growth, and future success. A balanced approach that incorporates both occupational subjects and music education can provide students with a comprehensive education that prepares them for both their professional and personal lives.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;The statement that universities should allocate equal funds to sports activities and libraries has sparked a heated debate. While both libraries and sports activities play crucial roles in a university's success, I strongly disagree with this assertion. In my opinion, universities should prioritize investing in libraries over other areas, including sports activities.First and foremost, a library is a vital and strategic part of a university. It serves as a hub for academic research, learning, and intellectual growth, providing students with access to a vast array of resources, including books, journals, and online databases. A well-equipped library is essential for students to excel in their studies, conduct research, and achieve academic success. By investing in libraries, universities can ensure that their students have the necessary tools to succeed in their academic pursuits.Second, unlike sports activities, libraries usually do not have alternative sources of income. Sports teams can generate revenue through ticket sales, sponsorships, and merchandise, whereas libraries rely heavily on university funding to operate and maintain their collections. This financial disparity makes it even more crucial for universities to allocate a larger share of their budget to libraries, ensuring that they can continue to provide essential services to students.In conclusion, while sports activities are important for student well-being and university spirit, I firmly believe that libraries should be the priority when it comes to funding. By investing more in libraries, universities can guarantee that their students have access to the resources they need to succeed academically, ultimately contributing to the university's overall success.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";"The widespread use of English as a global language has sparked a heated debate about its impact on lesser-known languages. Some people claim that the prevalence of English brings a great number of benefits for people, including improved communication, economic opportunities, and access to knowledge. With English as a common language, it is easier for people from different countries to interact, conduct business, and share ideas. This has undoubtedly facilitated global understanding and cooperation.However, opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed cultural diversity and led to the extinction of many less-used languages. As English becomes the primary language of international communication, native languages and dialects are being abandoned, especially among younger generations. This loss of linguistic heritage is a significant disadvantage, as languages are often closely tied to a community's history, culture, and identity.Moreover, even English, a sophisticated language, does not express every detail of life, especially in Asian countries, which have totally different linguistic systems. For instance, the nuances of Asian cultures, such as the concept of ""saving face"" or the subtleties of nonverbal communication, cannot be fully conveyed through English. The reliance on English may lead to the loss of these unique cultural expressions and the homogenization of local customs. In conclusion, while the advantages of English as a global language are undeniable, the disadvantages, including the loss of cultural diversity and linguistic heritage, cannot be ignored. It is essential to strike a balance between the use of English and the preservation of native languages to ensure that the world's rich cultural tapestry is maintained."
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The debate over the use of animals for human benefit has sparked intense discussion, with some advocating for the exploitation of animals for personal gain, while others champion the protection of animal rights. On one hand, many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, such as transportation, companionship, and labor. This perspective is often driven by convenience and economic interests. However, on the other hand, there are those who are concerned that animals should not be misused or exploited, recognizing the inherent value and dignity of these creatures.Unfortunately, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits, subjecting them to inhumane conditions, overwork, and neglect. This blatant disregard for animal welfare underscores the need for a shift in human attitude towards animals. Rather than viewing ourselves as the lords or masters of animals, it is essential that human beings behave as guardians to animals. This entails recognizing the intrinsic rights and interests of animals, and taking steps to ensure their well-being and protection.By adopting a guardian-like approach, humans can work to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of animals, and instead, foster a relationship built on mutual respect and care. This not only aligns with moral and ethical principles but also acknowledges the interconnectedness of human and animal well-being. Ultimately, it is crucial that we reevaluate our relationship with animals and strive to create a world where their rights are protected, and their dignity is respected. By doing so, we can work towards a more compassionate and sustainable coexistence with the animal kingdom.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The advent of modern technology has led to a surge in virtual exhibitions, sparking debates about the potential demise of museums and art galleries. Some people think that with the ability to view exhibitions from the comfort of their own homes, museums and art galleries will soon become obsolete. However, I strongly disagree with this notion.The importance of museums and art galleries extends far beyond mere visual display. They serve as institutions of education and culture, providing a tangible and immersive experience that cannot be replicated by modern technology. Authentic exhibits, in particular, cannot be completely displayed solely through images and videos. The texture, the scale, and the intricate details of artworks and artifacts are often lost in digital translations, making physical interaction with them invaluable.Moreover, museums and art galleries offer a communal experience, allowing people to gather, discuss, and learn from one another. The social aspect of visiting these institutions is an integral part of their appeal, fostering a sense of community and shared cultural appreciation. While technology can provide access to a wider audience, it lacks the personal, human element that makes museums and galleries so enriching.In conclusion, despite the advancements in technology, museums and art galleries will continue to thrive. Their role in preserving history, promoting cultural understanding, and providing unique educational experiences ensures their relevance in the modern world. Rather than viewing technology as a replacement, it should be seen as a complementary tool, enhancing the museum and gallery experience, and making their contents more accessible and engaging for a broader audience. Ultimately, the value of museums and art galleries lies not just in what they display, but in the comprehensive and personal experience they offer, which technology, no matter how advanced, cannot fully replace.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate about whether teenagers should learn all school subjects or focus on specific ones has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. Public opinion retains differing views on this matter, with some advocating for a comprehensive education and others supporting a more specialized approach.On one hand, some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children, believing that learning all subjects provides a well-rounded education. This approach allows students to develop a broad range of skills and knowledge, making them more versatile and adaptable in an ever-changing world. By studying various subjects, including mathematics, science, literature, and history, students can discover their strengths and weaknesses, and make informed decisions about their future careers. Moreover, learning multiple subjects helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for success in any field.On the other hand, others claim that studying only one subject or a select few is more effective, as it enables students to delve deeper into areas that genuinely interest them. This approach can foster a greater sense of passion and motivation, leading to better academic performance and a stronger sense of purpose. By focusing on specific subjects, students can also develop specialized skills and expertise, making them more competitive in their chosen fields.In my opinion, a balanced approach is the most beneficial. While it is essential to provide students with a broad foundation in various subjects, it is also crucial to allow them to explore and specialize in areas that they are passionate about. By doing so, students can develop a comprehensive education while also pursuing their interests and strengths. Ultimately, a combination of both approaches can lead to a more engaging, effective, and successful learning experience for teenagers.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The increasing dominance of English as a global language has sparked concerns about the decline of lesser-known languages. While it is true that the prevalence of English may contribute to the demise of some languages, I firmly believe that the advantages of English as a lingua franca far outweigh the disadvantages.In spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. For instance, in my country, English is a required course from elementary school, which has opened up numerous opportunities for young people. Studying abroad, for example, has become relatively easy and has become a popular trend among youngsters. This not only broadens their cultural horizons but also enhances their career prospects.Moreover, the importance of English extends beyond the realm of education. Researchers, especially those who work on high-tech fields, would have a wider range of references if they are good at English. This is because most cutting-edge research and academic papers are published in English, making it an essential tool for scholars to stay updated with the latest developments in their fields. Furthermore, English facilitates international collaboration, allowing experts from diverse backgrounds to share knowledge and work together to tackle complex global challenges.In conclusion, while the rise of English may pose a threat to some minority languages, its benefits to individuals, communities, and nations cannot be overstated. By providing a common language for international communication, English has bridged cultural and geographical divides, fostering global understanding, cooperation, and progress. As English continues to spread, it is likely to remain a vital component of modern life, facilitating exchange, innovation, and advancement across the world.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The question of whether creative artists should be given the freedom to express their own ideas without government restrictions is a contentious issue. In my opinion, I largely agree that artists should be allowed to express themselves freely, as creativity originates in a free mind. When artists are given the liberty to think and create without constraints, they are able to produce their most innovative and meaningful work.Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions, as this allows them to tap into their full potential and bring forth new and original ideas. This freedom is essential for the development of art, music, film, and literature, as it enables artists to push boundaries, challenge societal norms, and inspire new perspectives. Moreover, a free and unrestricted artistic environment fosters a culture of experimentation and innovation, leading to the creation of groundbreaking and iconic works.However, like the media, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. While freedom of expression is essential, it is equally important for artists to be responsible and considerate of their audience. Artists should be mindful of the impact their work may have on different communities and individuals, and strive to create work that is respectful and inclusive. By doing so, artists can maintain their creative freedom while also being socially responsible and respectful of the diverse perspectives and values of their audience. Ultimately, finding a balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility is crucial for the creation of meaningful and impactful art.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The debate surrounding the promotion of competition versus cooperation in children has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. On one hand, some argue that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential for their development, as it prepares them for the realities of the adult world. On the other hand, others believe that teaching children to cooperate rather than compete is more beneficial, as it enables them to become more useful and harmonious adults.In reality, co-operation and competition go hand in hand, and these two concepts are two sides of the same coin which cannot be separated. Competition has undoubtedly driven human progress, particularly in the fields of science and technology. The desire to outdo others has led to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations that have transformed our world. However,,erto, it is crucial to recognize that not all forms of competition are beneficial. The 'your loss, my gain' kind of competition, which prioritizes individual success over collective well-being, can never be fruitful in the long run. This approach can lead to an unhealthy and isolating environment, where individuals are pitted against each other, and ultimately, everyone loses.In my opinion, a balanced approach that incorporates both cooperation and competition is the most effective way to raise children. By teaching children to work together towards a common goal, while also encouraging them to strive for excellence, we can foster a sense of community and mutual respect. This approach will enable children to develop essential skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are vital for success in all areas of life. Ultimately, by embracing both cooperation and competition, we can raise a generation of well-rounded, empathetic, and achievment-oriented individuals who will make valuable contributions to society.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"The notion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society is a widely debated topic. While some argue that it is necessary to ensure security and deter crimes, others claim that it is an inhumane practice that does not effectively reduce crime rates. In my opinion,Crime is always punishable, and retribution is a method for countering criminals. The primary objective of punishment is to make the offender understand the severity of their actions and to serve as a deterrent to potential criminals. Capital punishment, is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases, where the crime is so heinous that it shocks the collective conscience of society. In such instances, the punishment serves as a means of retribution, When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. The knowledge of the severity of the punishment can act as a deterrent, preventing individuals from engaging in violent and heinous crimes. This, in turn, can lead to a safer society where lives are more secure. However, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks of capital punishment, In conclusion, while there are valid arguments both for and against capital punishment, I believe that it can be an effective means of controlling violence in society, particularly when used in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. The fear of severe punishment can act as a deterrent, making our lives more secure and reducing the incidence of violent crimes. Ultimately, the key to a safer society lies in striking a balance between punishment and rehabilitation, ensuring that justice is served while also addressing the root causes of crime."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;In many countries, students are encouraged to take a break from their academic pursuits between completing high school and embarking on university studies. This gap year, as it is commonly known, allows young people to work or travel, and can have both advantages and disadvantages. While some countries view this break as a waste of time, others recognize its benefits in providing a much-needed respite for young minds.Typically, a child's education journey is a continuous process, spanning from the age of 5 to 16 years. After over a decade of constant learning, a relaxation of one year can be quintessential in rejuvenating their minds and broadening their perspectives. Working or traveling during this period can be particularly beneficial, as it gives young individuals the opportunity to explore their interests and passions, potentially discovering their field of interest. This, in turn, can help them make more informed decisions about their future academic and career paths.On the other hand, taking a year off from studies can lead to a loss of momentum, making it challenging for some students to get back into the academic mindset. Moreover, the pressure to make the most of this break can be overwhelming, leading to stress and uncertainty about the future. Nevertheless, for many young people, the benefits of a gap year far outweigh the drawbacks. It provides a unique chance to gain practical experience, develop valuable life skills, and cultivate independence, all of which are essential for success in university and beyond. Ultimately, whether or not to take a gap year is a personal decision, but for those who do, it can be a life-enriching experience that sets them up for success in their future endeavors.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The computer is a device which has given a whole new dimension to human life. With its widespread application in various sectors, the whole world is now dependent on computers. Without these machines, the world would go back hundreds of years, losing the progress and advancements made in various fields. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient, and lightning fast, revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact.In the future, computers will be used for even more complex and innovative tasks. They will be employed in advanced medical research, space exploration, and sustainable energy solutions. Moreover, computers will continue to play a vital role in transportation, education, and entertainment, making our lives even more comfortable and enjoyable. The potential applications of computers are endless, and it is likely that they will become even more integrated into our daily lives.However, everything has pros and cons. While computers have numerous benefits, our increasing dependence on them also raises concerns. The risk of cyber attacks, data breaches, and job losses due to automation are some of the negative consequences of our reliance on computers. Furthermore, excessive screen time and decreased human interaction are also potential drawbacks of our computer-dominated world. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of these risks and take steps to mitigate them.In conclusion, while computers have transformed human life for the better, it is crucial to be mindful of their limitations and potential downsides. By acknowledging both the benefits and drawbacks of computers, we can harness their power to create a more efficient, convenient, and connected world, while also promoting responsible and sustainable use of technology. Ultimately, a balanced approach to computer dependence will enable us to maximize their advantages while minimizing their negative impacts.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The topic of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked a significant debate. While some argue that this approach is essential for promoting gender equality, others believe that it may not be practical or beneficial. In my opinion, I agree that universities should strive to achieve a balanced ratio of male and female students in every subject.Co-education, where both males and females study together, helps both genders to gel well with each other, fostering a sense of mutual respect and understanding. This, in turn, prepares students for the real world, where they will be working together with people of different genders. Moreover, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender-biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society, as it restricts talented individuals from contributing to these fields solely based on their gender.By accepting equal numbers of male and female students, universities can help break down these stereotypes and provide opportunities for women to excel in traditionally male-dominated fields. This not only promotes gender equality but also enriches the academic environment with diverse perspectives and ideas. Furthermore, it enables women to pursue careers in fields where they were previously underrepresented, leading to a more balanced and equitable society.In conclusion, I strongly believe that universities should strive to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. This approach will not only promote gender equality but also foster a more inclusive and diverse academic environment, ultimately benefiting the development of our society. By doing so, we can empower women to pursue their dreams and aspirations, unrestricted by outdated gender biases.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The role of games in children's development has been a topic of interest for many years. It is undeniable that games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities and social skills. In my opinion, traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills, and I strongly agree with this statement. For me, parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games, as they offer a wide range of benefits for children. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster communication skills, as children are required to interact with each other, share ideas, and work together as a team. This social interaction helps children develop essential life skills such as cooperation, empathy, and conflict resolution. Additionally, traditional games promote physical activity, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for a child's overall development.On the other hand, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits, and their primary focus is on individual entertainment rather than social interaction. While modern games may have some educational value, they often lack the social and physical elements that are present in traditional games. Moreover, excessive exposure to modern games can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, social isolation, and decreased attention span. In conclusion, traditional games are more effective in developing children's skills than modern games. They provide a unique opportunity for children to develop social, physical, and cognitive skills, which are essential for their overall growth and development. Therefore, it is crucial for parents and educators to encourage children to engage in traditional games, and to create an environment that supports and promotes healthy play. By doing so, we can help children develop into well-rounded, socially conscious, and physically active individuals.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funds is a topic of ongoing debate, with some people arguing that the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education over building theaters or sports stadiums. I strongly agree with this stance. Providing education and medical care is more essential and should be prioritized by the government, as these two sectors have a direct and significant impact on the well-being and quality of life of citizens.Investing in medical care ensures that citizens have access to quality healthcare, which is a fundamental right. Similarly, investing in education empowers future generations with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute to the economy and society. In contrast, building theaters or sports stadiums, while beneficial for entertainment and leisure, are not as crucial to the basic needs and development of a nation.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money into building theaters or sports stadiums can be seen as unfair to those who cannot use them. Not everyone may have the means or interest to attend events at these facilities, yet they still contribute to the taxes that fund these projects. This raises questions about the equitable distribution of public funds and the prioritization of needs over wants.In conclusion, providing education and medical care should undoubtedly be the government's priority when allocating funds. These sectors are fundamental to the health, education, and overall development of a society, making them more deserving of investment than entertainment or sports facilities. By prioritizing medical care and education, the government can ensure that it is meeting the essential needs of its citizens, which is its primary responsibility.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The notion that a country's technological development inevitably leads to the demise of traditional skills and ways of life is a common concern. Some people are worried that modern technological advancements are probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I disagree with the opinion that it is pointless to try and keep them alive. On the contrary, I believe that technology plays a key role in promoting traditional skills and ways of life.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote traditional skills. For instance, social media platforms and online tutorials can be used to showcase and teach traditional crafts, such as weaving, pottery, and woodcarving, to a global audience. This not only helps to preserve these skills but also provides a platform for artisans to sell their products and connect with potential customers. Moreover, digital archives and museums can be created to document and preserve traditional ways of life, making them accessible to people all over the world.Furthermore, technology can also help to innovate and adapt traditional skills to modern needs, making them more relevant and sustainable. For example, traditional farming practices can be combined with modern technology, such as precision agriculture and vertical farming, to increase crop yields and reduce environmental impact. By embracing technology, we can breathe new life into traditional skills and ways of life, rather than letting them die out. In conclusion, I firmly believe that technology and traditional skills are not mutually exclusive, and that technology can be a powerful tool in preserving and promoting our cultural heritage.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The debate surrounding the freedom of creative artists to express their ideas has sparked intense discussion. Some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government, as they believe this unrestricted freedom can lead to undesirable consequences. However, it is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized, as it is the foundation of a progressive and enlightened society.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading, which would destabilize the society. Critics argue that unregulated artistic expression can lead to the dissemination of harmful or offensive content, potentially influencing people's perceptions and behaviors in a negative way. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that such concerns can be addressed through education and critical thinking,Rather than imposing restrictions, artistic expression should be encouraged and celebrated. By allowing artists to freely express themselves, we foster a culture of innovation, diversity, and intellectual curiosity. Art has always been a powerful tool for social commentary, criticism, and change, and stifling it would only hinder progress and creativity. Ultimately, the benefits of artistic freedom far outweigh the perceived risks, and governments should prioritize protecting and promoting this fundamental right. By doing so, we can ensure that artists continue to inspire, challenge, and enrich our society, without fear of censorship or reprisal.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The issue of government control over violence in the media has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that the government should intervene to reduce violent crimes, others claim that such control would infringe upon freedom of expression. In my opinion, I agree to a certain extent that the government should control the amount of violence in the media.On one hand, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences, which can desensitize viewers to the harsh realities of violence. This can lead to a distorted perception of violence, making it seem more acceptable and glorified. As a result, excessive violence in the media can exert detrimental influence on society, particularly on children and young adults who may be more impressionable. By controlling the amount of violence in the media, the government can help to mitigate the potential harm caused by such portrayals.On the other hand, violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. News outlets have a responsibility to inform the public about important events, including those involving violence. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public, creating an inaccurate perception of the world. A balanced approach is necessary, where the government can regulate the media to ensure that violence is not sensationalized or glorified, while still allowing for factual reporting of important events.In conclusion, while the government should not completely ban violence in the media, some level of control is necessary to prevent the glorification and desensitization of violence. By striking a balance between freedom of expression and social responsibility, the government can help to reduce the potential negative impacts of violence in the media and promote a more informed and responsible public discourse.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. This shift has led to a significant increase in opportunities for women, and some people argue that this development has created more problems than it has solved. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. From my point of view, the empowerment of women is a positive progress in human society.In a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males, it would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles. For instance, the participation of women in the workforce has led to a more diverse and skilled labor market. Women bring unique perspectives and ideas to the table, which can lead to innovation and economic growth. Furthermore, the education and career advancement of women have a positive impact on their families and communities. Educated women are more likely to make informed decisions about their health, education, and financial security, which can lead to a healthier and more prosperous society.Moreover, the equality of opportunities for women has also led to a more balanced distribution of power and decision-making in society. Women are no longer confined to traditional roles and are free to pursue their passions and interests. This has led to a more vibrant and dynamic society where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and thrive. While there may be some challenges associated with the increasing opportunities for women, such as balancing work and family life, I believe that these can be addressed through supportive policies and social structures.In conclusion, the increase in opportunities for women is a welcome development that has brought numerous benefits to society. It is essential to continue promoting and supporting the empowerment of women to create a more equitable and prosperous world for all. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of women and create a brighter future for generations to come.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The proposition that increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems is a contentious issue. While it is true that higher petrol prices might reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thereby alleviating traffic congestion and decreasing air pollution, I only partially agree with this stance. Price control institutions have been utilized in various social areas, such as farming products and real estate, to regulate supply and demand. However, whether this mechanism can effectively mitigate traffic and pollution pressures is questionable. On one hand, increasing petrol prices could lead to a reduction in vehicle usage, as individuals might opt for alternative modes of transportation or consolidate their trips. This, in turn, could decrease emissions from petrol combustion.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that pollution is a multifaceted issue, not solely caused by the burning of oil. Other significant contributors to pollution include chemical pollutants and excessive lighting. These factors also constitute a considerable amount of pollution and cannot be ignored. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to addressing pollution and traffic congestion must consider these factors as well.In addition to price control, other measures could be effective in tackling traffic and pollution. For instance, investing in public transportation systems, promoting the use of electric or hybrid vehicles, and implementing stricter emissions standards for industries could significantly reduce pollution levels. Moreover, urban planning strategies that encourage dense, walkable neighborhoods and reduce the need for personal vehicles could also play a crucial role. In conclusion, while increasing petrol prices might offer some benefits, it is only one piece of the puzzle. A holistic approach, incorporating a variety of strategies, is necessary to effectively address the intertwined issues of traffic and pollution.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The question of whether advertisements should be banned is a contentious issue that sparks debate among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While some argue that advertisements are a necessary tool for businesses to reach their target audience,On the one hand, I agree that advertisements can have negative consequences, such as promoting materialism and manipulating consumers into buying unnecessary products. However, I also believe that not all advertisements are created equal. Public service advertisements, for instance, serve a greater good by disseminating valued culture, promoting good moral traits, and raising awareness about important social issues, such as calling for help for the disabled and the poor. These types of advertisements play a vital role in shaping public opinion and promoting social responsibility, and therefore, should be exempt from any potential ban.On the other hand, it is undeniable that commercial advertisements can have a significant impact on businesses. Publicizing a brand image or a particular product through mass media can boost sales and increase revenue for companies. This, in turn, can stimulate economic growth and create jobs. Moreover, advertisements can also inform consumers about new products and services, allowing them to make informed decisions about their purchases.In conclusion, while I understand the concerns surrounding advertisements, I do not entirely agree that they should be banned. A more nuanced approach would be to regulate advertisements to ensure that they are truthful, transparent, and respectful of consumers' rights. By allowing public service advertisements and regulating commercial ones, we can strike a balance between promoting economic growth and protecting the well-being of society. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize the value of advertisements in promoting social good and driving economic progress, while also acknowledging the need for responsible and ethical advertising practices.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. The pressure to meet deadlines,succeed in their careers, and maintain a work-life balance can be overwhelming, leading to increased levels of anxiety and depression. To cope with these challenges, individuals employ various strategies to reduce stress and improve their overall well-being. I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise.Exercise can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions. Engaging in physical activities such as running, swimming, or yoga can help alleviate stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, also known as ""feel-good"" hormones. These natural chemicals promote a sense of happiness and relaxation, enabling individuals to better manage the pressures of modern life. For instance, a study found that regular exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression by up to s 47%. Furthermore, exercise provides an opportunity for social interaction, whether it's joining a sports team, taking a fitness class, or simply exercising with a friend. This social aspect of exercise can help individuals build supportive networks, further enhancing their mental health.In addition to its mental health benefits, exercise can also improve physical health, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Regular physical activity can boost the immune system, increase energy levels, and enhance sleep quality, all of which are essential for maintaining overall health and resilience in the face of modern life's challenges. In conclusion, exercise is a highly effective way to reduce stress and improve mental and physical well-being in modern society. By incorporating different kinds of exercise into their daily routines, individuals can better cope with the difficulties of modern life and lead healthier, happier lives."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"The notion that images are becoming a more powerful means of communication than the written word has sparked a heated debate in recent years. The phrase ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that has been used for a very long time, highlighting the impact and effectiveness of visual communication. I agree to a certain degree that in today's world, images serve as a more effective means of communication.Images have the ability to convey complex ideas and emotions in a split second, making them a powerful tool for communication. With the rise of social media, images and videos are being shared and consumed at an unprecedented rate, allowing messages to be spread quickly and efficiently. Moreover, images can transcend language barriers, making them a universal means of communication. For instance, a photograph of a natural disaster can evoke emotions and convey the severity of the situation, regardless of the viewer's language or cultural background.However, the importance of the written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication commonly used. Written communication provides a level of detail and nuance that images often cannot match. It allows for the expression of complex ideas, arguments, and narratives that require a deeper level of understanding. Moreover, written words can be revisited and re-read, allowing the reader to absorb and reflect on the information at their own pace. In conclusion, while images are undoubtedly a powerful means of communication, I believe that they complement, rather than replace, the written word. A balance between the two is necessary for effective communication, as each has its own unique strengths and advantages."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The issue of language extinction has sparked a heated debate about whether governments should allocate public funds to preserve minority languages. Some people believe that governments should preserve minority languages by spending some budgets on them. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly, and this essay will discuss this issue.On the one hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Firstly, the cost of preserving a language can be substantial, and the funds allocated to this cause could be better spent on other pressing issues such as education, healthcare, or infrastructure. Additionally, the number of speakers of these minority languages is often very small, which raises questions about the practicality of investing in their preservation. Moreover, in a rapidly globalizing world, the importance of languages like English, Mandarin, or Spanish is increasing, making the preservation of minority languages seem less relevant.On the other hand, there are also valid arguments in favor of preserving minority languages. Language is a crucial part of a culture's identity and heritage, and its loss can lead to the erasure of a community's history and traditions. Furthermore, linguistic diversity has been proven to have numerous cognitive and social benefits, and preserving minority languages can contribute to a richer and more diverse cultural landscape. By spending public money on saving these languages, governments can help to promote cultural diversity and preserve the unique characteristics of different communities.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that preserving minority languages is essential for maintaining cultural diversity and promoting the unique characteristics of different communities. However, it is crucial to approach this issue with a thoughtful and balanced perspective, considering both the benefits and drawbacks of such an investment.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The notion that arts and music do not contribute to the improvement of the quality of life has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the government should allocate its resources to other sectors, I strongly agree that the government should prioritize investing in basic social welfares, such as education and housing, over the arts.In my opinion, art is not the key determinant of quality of life. Instead, education plays a vital role in enhancing the lives of individuals and fostering a well-rounded social system. Knowledge and wisdom, acquired through education, are the guarantees of a better life, enabling people to make informed decisions, think critically, and innovate. Education lays the foundation for personal and societal growth, and its importance cannot be overstated. By prioritizing education, the government can ensure that its citizens are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in an increasingly complex world.In contrast, while arts and music can provide entertainment and cultural enrichment, they are not as crucial to the overall well-being of a society. The government's primary responsibility is to provide for the basic needs of its citizens, including access to quality education, housing, and healthcare. By allocating its resources to these essential areas, the government can create a more equitable and prosperous society. Therefore, I firmly believe that the government should give priority to investing in education and other basic social welfares, rather than the arts, to ensure a better quality of life for its citizens. By doing so, the government can build a strong foundation for a thriving and harmonious society, where knowledge, wisdom, and innovation can flourish.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The debate on whether the government should pay for healthcare and education has sparked intense discussion among citizens. Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the healthcare and education for citizens, as these are basic necessities that everyone deserves access to. They believe that by providing these essential services, the government can ensure a healthier and more educated population, which can contribute to the overall development of the country.On the other hand, some people oppose this argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize the health and education of each citizen. They argue that individuals should take responsibility for their own healthcare and education, and that government intervention would only lead to inefficiency and abuse of resources. According to them, the government has more pressing priorities that require funding, such as infrastructure and national security.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their healthcare. It is unfair that those who are less fortunate are denied access to quality healthcare due to financial constraints. By providing healthcare to the underprivileged, the government can help reduce poverty and inequality, and create a more just society. Furthermore, a healthy population is more productive and can contribute to the economic growth of the country. While it is true that the government has limited resources, I believe that prioritizing the healthcare of the deprived is a necessary investment in the well-being of its citizens. Education is also important, but I think that the government should focus on providing subsidies to those who cannot afford it, rather than making it completely free for everyone. Overall, I believe that the government has a crucial role to play in ensuring that all citizens have access to quality healthcare and education.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The existence of zoos in the 21st century has been a topic of debate among many people. Animal-right activists strongly recommend that wildlife belongs to their natural environment and that zoos should be banned. However, I would not go along with their viewpoint. While it is true that wild animals are meant to roam free in their natural habitats, I believe that a well-designed, man-made environment can provide a better alternative for the survival and well-being of these animals.A good man-made environment can prolong the life span of wild animals, which may not be possible in their natural habitats due to various threats such as poaching, habitat destruction, and climate change. Moreover, zoos can play a crucial role in cultivating the notion of protecting animals and promoting conservation efforts. By providing a safe and controlled environment, zoos can help to breed endangered species, which can eventually be released back into the wild. Additionally, zoos can serve as educational centers, where people, especially children, can learn about the importance of conservation and the need to protect wildlife.Furthermore, many modern zoos have evolved to prioritize animal welfare and provide naturalistic habitats that mimic the animals' natural environments. These zoos also engage in research and conservation efforts, which can have a positive impact on the protection of wildlife. In conclusion, while I understand the concerns of animal-right activists, I believe that zoos can still play a vital role in the 21st century. By providing a safe and controlled environment, promoting conservation efforts, and educating the public, zoos can contribute to the protection and preservation of wild animals, making them a valuable institution in modern society.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The notion that environmental degradation is an inevitable consequence of improving living standards in industrialized countries is a topic of debate. While some people are worried that the economic targets in these countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems, I disagree with this statement. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.It is true that some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. The pursuit of rapid growth and profit can lead to the exploitation of natural resources, resulting in pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. However, this does not have to be the case. With careful planning, innovative technologies, and sustainable practices, it is possible for countries to achieve economic prosperity while preserving the environment.In fact, many industrialized countries have demonstrated that economic growth and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive. For instance, countries like Sweden and Denmark have implemented policies that prioritize renewable energy, reduce waste, and promote eco-friendly industries. These initiatives not only mitigate environmental harm but also create new job opportunities and stimulate innovation. By adopting a sustainable approach to development, countries can ensure that their economic progress is environmentally conscious and responsible.In conclusion, while some countries may prioritize economic development over environmental protection, it is not an inevitable trade-off. With foresight and commitment, industrialized countries can balance their economic targets with environmental preservation, creating a more sustainable future for generations to come.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The allocation of government funds has always been a topic of debate, with some arguing that the budget should prioritize public services and facilities over the arts. Proponents of this view suggest that tax money should be allocated to publicly beneficial services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, rather than being spent on what they perceive as non-essential artistic pursuits. However, from my perspective, I strongly disagree with this stance.I believe that arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well. The arts play a vital role in the development and enrichment of society, fostering creativity, innovation, and cultural diversity. Government funding for the arts can help support local artists, museums, and cultural events, which in turn can boost tourism and stimulate local economies. Moreover, the arts have been proven to have a positive impact on mental health, social cohesion, and education, making them a worthwhile investment for the government.Furthermore, a society without art would be devoid of creativity, imagination, and self-expression. The arts provide a platform for people to express their thoughts, opinions, and emotions, promoting freedom of speech and intellectual curiosity. By investing in the arts, the government can promote a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the world, encouraging citizens to think critically and challenge the status quo.In conclusion, while some people may argue that government funds should be solely allocated to public services and facilities, I firmly believe that the arts should also be included in the government's investment portfolio. The benefits of arts funding, from promoting cultural diversity to stimulating local economies, make it an essential aspect of a well-rounded and thriving society. By supporting the arts, the government can create a more vibrant, creative, and enlightened community, which is essential for the well-being and progress of its citizens.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The debate about whether animals should be kept in zoos has sparked intense discussion among critics and advocators of zoology. Critics argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because they should be considered non-human persons with the right to freedom. They believe that animals have inherent rights and interests that should be respected, and that confinement in zoos is a violation of these rights. For instance, animals like elephants and chimpanzees have complex social and emotional needs that cannot be met in a zoo environment, and are often subjected to stress and boredom.On the other hand, advocators of zoos believe that they provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of ecology. They argue that zoos play a crucial role in conservation efforts, as they provide a safe haven for endangered species and participate in breeding programs to increase population numbers. Additionally, zoos offer educational programs and raise awareness about the importance of conservation and wildlife preservation. For example, the San Diego Zoo has a successful breeding program for giant pandas, which has helped to increase the population of this endangered species.However, I tend to agree with the critics that animals should be free and not kept in zoos. While zoos may provide entertainment and contribute to conservation efforts, their benefits do not outweigh the harm caused to the animals. Keeping animals in captivity can lead to physical and psychological harm, and it is our responsibility to prioritize their welfare and well-being. Instead of keeping animals in zoos, we should focus on protecting and preserving their natural habitats, which would allow them to thrive in their natural environment.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;"The presence of advertising is ubiquitous in our daily lives, and opinions about its impact vary greatly. On one hand, many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to our lives, therefore it should be considered a positive activity. It informs consumers about new products, services, and ideas, which can improve their quality of life. For instance, advertising has been instrumental in promoting public health campaigns, raising awareness about social issues, and supporting local businesses. These contributions suggest that advertising plays a vital role in shaping our consumption habits and cultural norms.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. A huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, leading to a phenomenon known as ""advertising pollution."" This not only invades individuals' privacy but also contributes to the overwhelming amount of information people are exposed to daily, potentially causing stress and confusion. Furthermore, advertising often perpetuates unrealistic beauty standards, manipulates consumer preferences, and encourages excessive consumption, which can have detrimental effects on mental and environmental health.In my opinion, while acknowledging the benefits advertising brings, its negative aspects cannot be overlooked. It is essential for advertisers to adopt responsible and ethical practices, ensuring that their messages are respectful, truthful, and environmentally conscious. Moreover, regulatory measures should be implemented to curb the invasive and excessive dissemination of advertisements, particularly in personal and private spaces. By striking a balance between the informative role of advertising and the need to protect individual well-being and privacy, we can harness its positive potential while mitigating its adverse effects. Ultimately, a thoughtful and regulated approach to advertising can foster a healthier and more informed consumer culture."
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate, with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy. They argue that nuclear power plants can produce a significant amount of electricity with minimal environmental impact, as they do not release greenhouse gases or other pollutants into the atmosphere. Additionally, proponents claim that nuclear energy is a cheap and reliable source of power, which can help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change.However, as far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usage of nuclear power. While it is true that nuclear power plants do not release greenhouse gases during operation, they do produce radioactive waste, which can have devastating environmental and health consequences if not disposed of properly. Furthermore, the risk of nuclear accidents, such as those that occurred at Chernobyl and Fukushima, is a constant concern, and the consequences of such accidents can be catastrophic.Moreover, the cost of building and maintaining nuclear power plants is often underestimated, and the financial burden of decommissioning them at the end of their lifespan can be substantial. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with nuclear energy and do not carry the same environmental and health risks. Therefore, I disagree that the advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Instead, I believe that we should prioritize investment in renewable energy sources and phase out our reliance on nuclear power in favor of cleaner, safer, and more sustainable alternatives. Ultimately, the risks associated with nuclear power outweigh any potential benefits, and I firmly believe that we should explore alternative energy sources to meet our power needs.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has been ongoing for years. While some argue that the countryside provides a more peaceful and natural environment for children to grow, I disagree and believe that big cities are a better place for bringing up children.One of the main advantages of big cities is the access to better education. Schools in cities are generally well-equipped and staffed with experienced teachers, providing children with a higher quality of education compared to those in the countryside. Additionally, big cities offer a wide range of educational resources, such as libraries, museums, and cultural centers, which can enrich a child's learning experience.Big cities also offer a variety of recreational facilities, such as parks, playgrounds, and sports centers, where children can engage in physical activities and develop their social skills. These facilities provide children with a safe and supervised environment to play and interact with other children, which is essential for their physical and emotional development. In contrast, children who live in the countryside often spend most of their free time on farms, which can be limiting in terms of access to educational and recreational resources.In conclusion, while the countryside may have its advantages, I believe that big cities provide a more comprehensive and stimulating environment for children to grow and develop. With better education, a wide range of recreational facilities, and greater access to cultural and educational resources, big cities are a better place for bringing up children. Overall, the benefits of city life far outweigh those of country life when it comes to raising children.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The debate about whether to work for a company or to be one's own boss has been ongoing for years. In society, there are numerous kinds of jobs, ranging from those in government-related companies to those in private companies. Each type of company has its advantages and disadvantages. Government-related companies often offer job security and stability, while private companies may provide more opportunities for career advancement and higher salaries. However, after weighing the pros and cons, I firmly believe that going into business for oneself is the better option.Working for a company can be restrictive, as one has to follow the rules and regulations set by the organization. On the other hand, being one's own boss provides the freedom to make decisions and take risks. Having my own business would allow me to pursue my passions and interests, and to create something that I can truly call my own. Moreover, being an entrepreneur would give me the opportunity to be innovative and creative, to experiment with new ideas, and to learn from my mistakes.Furthermore, having my own business would provide me with the potential for unlimited earnings, as my success would depend solely on my hard work and dedication. In a company, one's salary is often fixed, and career advancement may be limited. In contrast, as an entrepreneur, I would have the freedom to set my own goals and to strive for excellence. In conclusion, while both working for a company and being one's own boss have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe that going into business for oneself is the better option, as it provides freedom, creativity, and unlimited potential for growth and success.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" is a profound mantra that resonates with the idea of perseverance and determination. It means to keep trying and never stop working towards one's goal, regardless of the obstacles or setbacks that may arise. I firmly agree with this statement, as I believe that giving up in the face of failure is not a viable solution to overcoming adversity.Many individuals throughout their life face at least one failure in different areas, such as education, love, and economy. It is natural to feel discouraged and disheartened when faced with defeat. Some people believe that when a defeated person faces failure, the best way to cope is to forget about it and move on. However, I strongly disagree with this approach. Forgetting or releasing one's failures without learning from them can lead to a lack of personal growth and development.In contrast, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face failure. Instead, they should use it as an opportunity to learn and improve. Every failure provides a chance to reflect on what went wrong and to make adjustments for the future. By persisting and persevering, the chances of success increase, and the sense of accomplishment is more fulfilling. Moreover, giving up can lead to a pattern of behavior that can be detrimental to one's self-esteem and confidence. On the other hand, never giving up fosters a growth mindset, resilience, and determination, which are essential qualities for achieving success in any area of life. Therefore, I strongly believe that the expression ""Never, never give up"" is a valuable motto that can inspire individuals to push through challenges and strive for their goals, even in the face of adversity."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The debate over whether human needs or saving land for endangered animals is more important has sparked intense discussion. While endangered animals are crucial for maintaining the ecosystem's balance, I agree that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry should be prioritized.Firstly, the world's population is increasing day by day, which leads to a surge in demand for food. To cater to this growing need, farmland is essential for crop cultivation and livestock breeding. If we allocate more land for endangered animals, we risk compromising food security, which is a fundamental human necessity. The need for sustenance outweighs the requirement for preserving habitats for endangered species.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from the elements and harsh weather conditions. Land is required to build houses, providing a safe haven for humans. The provision of housing is a basic human need, and allocating land for this purpose takes precedence over conserving land for animals. Human safety and well-being should be the top priority, and housing is an indispensable aspect of this.Lastly, human comfort and convenience are significantly enhanced with the help of industry. Industrial development provides employment opportunities, manufactures goods, and contributes to the overall economic growth. To facilitate industrial expansion, land is necessary, and it is essential to allocate land for this purpose. The benefits of industry to human society are multifaceted, making it a vital aspect of human needs.In conclusion, while endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more pressing. The increasing population, need for housing, and requirement for industrial development all necessitate the allocation of land for human purposes. Therefore, I firmly believe that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry should take precedence over saving land for endangered animals.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"The age-old adage ""don't judge a book by its cover"" still holds true today. The statement ""one should never judge a person by external appearance"" is a notion that I wholeheartedly agree with. Individuals have two distinct features: appearance and personality. While appearance is undoubtedly important, I firmly believe that personality is the most crucial aspect of a person.Appearance, which encompasses physical characteristics such as facial features, body shape, and style, is often the first thing we notice about someone. However, it is superficial and can be deceiving. A person may have a stunning exterior, but lack substance and character. On the other hand, personality refers to the unique traits, values, and attitudes that define an individual. It is the essence of who they are, shaping their thoughts, feelings, and actions.From my point of view, although appearance is important, personality is the most important. A person's character, values, and behavior are what truly matter. A beautiful person with a ugly personality can be off-putting, whereas someone with a less-than-stunning appearance but a beautiful personality can be incredibly attractive. It is the personality that determines how a person interacts with others, builds relationships, and contributes to society.In conclusion, judging someone solely based on their external appearance is misguided and unfair. It is the personality that truly defines an individual, and it is essential to look beyond the surface level to appreciate the real value of a person. By doing so, we can foster deeper connections, build stronger relationships, and create a more harmonious and inclusive community. Ultimately, it is the personality that shines brighter than physical appearance, and it is what truly matters in the end."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The debate about whether there should be a single international language has sparked intense discussion among scholars and linguists. On one hand, I firmly believe that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation, facilitating trade and commerce across borders. A universal language would enable nations to communicate effectively, fostering collaboration and understanding in the business world. It would also simplify international transactions, making it easier for companies to operate globally. Moreover, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions, allowing people from diverse backgrounds to connect and exchange ideas.On the other hand, I also acknowledge that a single international language could potentially threaten the preservation of cultural heritage. Every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage, including their language, customs, and traditions. Language is a vital aspect of cultural identity, and its loss could lead to the erosion of a nation's unique character. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between promoting a universal language for global communication and preserving the linguistic diversity that makes each culture unique.In conclusion, while a single international language has its advantages in promoting global economic cooperation and cultural exchange, it is crucial to recognize the importance of preserving cultural heritage. Rather than adopting a single language, it might be more beneficial to encourage language learning and cultural exchange programs, allowing people to appreciate and respect the diversity of languages and cultures that exist worldwide. By doing so, we can promote global understanding and cooperation while preserving the richness of cultural diversity.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The notion that fashion trends are merely a marketing ploy to sell clothes has sparked a debate about their relevance in our lives. While some people argue that we should ditch these trends and dress in what we like, I partially disagree with this sentiment. Some individuals think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends, as it allows for self-expression and individuality. However,From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles. This is because following trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations. Fashion trends often reflect the cultural, social, and economic shifts of the time, and being aware of them can help individuals stay connected to the world around them. Moreover, fashion trends can also serve as a means of self-expression, just like personal style. By incorporating trendy pieces into their wardrobe, people can showcase their personality and creativity while still being part of a larger cultural narrative.Furthermore, following fashion trends can also have practical benefits, such as providing inspiration for outfit ideas and helping people to update their wardrobes in a way that is relevant to the current time. In conclusion, while personal style is important, I believe that fashion trends play a significant role in people's lives, and following them can be a fun and creative way to engage with the world around us. Rather than seeing them as mutually exclusive, we can embrace both personal style and fashion trends to create a unique and expressive approach to fashion.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate on whether wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer nations has sparked intense discussion in recent years. In my opinion, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor. It is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty, as it goes against the principles of humanity and compassion. The stark contrast between the opulence of wealthy nations and the desperation of poorer ones is a stark reminder of the need for global solidarity.Providing aid in the form of food and education can be a powerful tool in alleviating poverty and promoting development. By sharing their wealth, wealthy nations can help poorer nations build the foundations for sustainable growth and prosperity. Moreover, economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. By investing in the development of poorer nations, wealthy nations can create new markets, stimulate trade, and foster economic cooperation. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic growth, job creation, and improved living standards for all.Rather than solely relying on the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves, it is the responsibility of the global community to come together and address the pressing issues of poverty and inequality. Wealthy nations have a moral obligation to assist those in need, and by doing so, they can help create a more equitable and just world. Ultimately, sharing wealth and providing aid is not only a humanitarian imperative but also a sound economic strategy that can benefit both the giver and the receiver. By working together, we can create a brighter future for all, where everyone has access to the basic necessities of life, including food and education.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;I strongly agree with the statement that a large proportion of our country's health budget should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures. This reallocation of funds is crucial for promoting a healthier society and reducing the economic burden of healthcare.Health education is a vital investment in the well-being of future generations. By educating people about healthy habits, nutrition, and disease prevention, we can cause long-term positive effects on our next generations. This knowledge will empower individuals to make informed decisions about their lifestyle, enabling them to protect themselves from the risks of diseases. Moreover, health education will prepare people with the necessary knowledge to adopt preventive behaviors, such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and screenings, which can help detect diseases at an early stage.Preventative measures, such as immunization programs, public health campaigns, and community-based initiatives, will help improve the general health state of all citizens. By focusing on prevention, we can reduce the incidence of diseases, which in turn, will decrease the demand for costly treatments. The cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, and by diverting funds towards preventative measures, we can avoid expensive medical interventions and hospitalizations.In conclusion, diverting a large proportion of our country's health budget from treatment to health education and preventative measures is a wise decision. It will have a lasting impact on the health and well-being of our citizens, while also reducing the financial burden of healthcare on our economy. By investing in health education and prevention, we can create a healthier, more informed, and more resilient society for generations to come.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The rise of news media has undoubtedly become a pervasive aspect of modern life, with its influence extending into various facets of society. While many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits, citing concerns such as misinformation and sensationalism, I firmly believe that the benefits of news media far surpass its negative consequences.On one hand, critics argue that the proliferation of news media has led to a decline in the quality of information, with many outlets prioritizing ratings over factual reporting. This can indeed have detrimental effects, such as shaping public opinion with biased or inaccurate information. However, it is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people's knowledge, keeping them informed about current events, global issues, and cultural trends.News media plays a vital role in educating the public, fostering critical thinking, and promoting civic engagement. Through in-depth reporting and analysis, news media provides a platform for nuanced discussions, allowing individuals to form informed opinions and engage in meaningful conversations. Furthermore, the diversity of news sources enables people to access a wide range of perspectives, broadening their understanding of complex issues and encouraging empathy.Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that the popularity of news media is a positive development. While acknowledging the potential pitfalls, it is essential to recognize the significant contributions news media makes to societal awareness, education, and cultural enrichment. By promoting media literacy and critical consumption, we can harness the benefits of news media, ultimately leading to a more informed, engaged, and enlightened public. In conclusion, the influence of news media on people's lives is a multifaceted phenomenon, and its merits, in my opinion, outweigh its drawbacks.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;The advent of international sporting occasions,I strongly agree that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. These events have the unique ability to bring nations together,International sporting occasions like the football World Cup can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely. The spirit of healthiness, honesty, and fairness that pervades these events fosters an atmosphere of mutual respect and camaraderie among participating nations. As athletes from different countries compete with one another,Sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. Furthermore, these occasions provide a platform for people from diverse backgrounds to come together and celebrate their shared love of sports. Sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. The display of national flags, anthems, and jerseys evokes a sense of national pride and belonging, allowing individuals to express their patriotism in a safe and controlled environment.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are indeed vital in easing international tensions and providing a healthy outlet for patriotic emotions. By promoting cross-cultural understanding, respect and friendship, these events contribute significantly to global harmony and peace. As the world continues to grapple with conflicts and divisions, the importance of such occasions cannot be overstated. They serve as a powerful reminder of the unifying power of sports and its ability to bring people together in a shared celebration of human achievement and excellence.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;The debate about children engaging in paid work has sparked intense discussions globally. In many countries, children are educated from a young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. This approach is reflected in their participation in paid work, which is seen as a means to foster responsibility and independence. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure, arguing that it may hinder their physical, emotional, and educational development.From my point of view, the benefits of children's engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks. By engaging in paid work, children can gain valuable work experience, develop a strong work ethic, and understand the importance of earning a living. This early exposure to the workforce can also help them develop essential life skills such as time management, budgeting, and communication. Furthermore, it can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and self-worth, boosting their confidence and motivation to pursue their goals.Moreover, paid work can serve as a supplement to their education, teaching them practical skills that may not be covered in their school curriculum. It can also help them develop a sense of responsibility, as they learn to balance their work and academic obligations. While it is essential to ensure that the work does not interfere with their education or pose any health risks, moderate engagement in paid work can be a valuable learning experience for children. In conclusion, when properly managed, children's engagement in paid work can be a beneficial and empowering experience, preparing them for their future careers and personal growth.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, it has become an increasingly common trend for young people to take a break between finishing high school and starting university studies. This gap year, as it is often referred to, allows students to step away from the academic environment and engage in other activities that can be highly beneficial for their personal and professional growth. Some students choose to travel all around the world during this time, exploring different cultures and meeting new people, while others opt to take up a job to gain practical experience.The advantages of taking a gap year are numerous. The experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people, and even working at a job goes a long way in shaping a young individual's personality and skills. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent, teaching them valuable life skills such as budgeting, time management, and self-reliance. Moreover, the real-world experience obtained during this period can be a significant addition to a student's resume, making them more attractive to potential employers and universities.On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Taking a gap year can lead to a disruption in the momentum of a student's academic career, potentially making it difficult for them to adjust to university life after a year of not studying. Additionally, the financial burden of traveling or living independently can be significant, and not all students may have the means to support themselves during this time.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments both for and against taking a gap year, the benefits of this experience often outweigh the drawbacks. By traveling, working, or engaging in other activities, young people can gain invaluable experience, build their confidence, and develop into independent and capable individuals, ready to take on the challenges of university studies and beyond.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. The statement that the qualities a person needs to become successful cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution is a topic of debate. I do agree with that opinion to a certain degree. While universities provide a solid foundation of knowledge and skills, However, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports, where talent, dedication, and hard work are the primary requisites for success. Many successful individuals in these fields have achieved greatness without formal education,Moreover, qualities such as creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, which are essential for success, can be developed through real-world experiences, internships and mentorship.  Universities can provide a good starting point, but it is ultimately up to the individual to apply and hone their skills in a practical setting. In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of academic institutions in providing a foundation for success, I believe that they are not the only path to achieving greatness. Other factors, such as passion, perseverance, and opportunity, also play a significant role in determining an individual's success.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The advent of technology has led to the emergence of a notion that public museums and art galleries may soon become obsolete. Proponents of this idea argue that with the ability to view historical objects and artworks online, people will no longer need to physically visit these institutions. However, I strongly disagree with this assertion. While it is true that the internet has made it possible for people to access and view artworks and historical objects from the comfort of their own homes, Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for artwork because the Internet really brings them convenience. They can browse through numerous collections and exhibits with just a few clicks, saving them time and effort. Nevertheless, I still believe that public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online. The reason behind this is that viewing artworks and historical objects online can never replace the experience of seeing them in person. Pictures online are only limited to a screen size, and people may not get a spiritual experience when viewing them. In contrast, physical museums and galleries offer a unique and immersive experience that allows visitors to connect with the artworks and objects on a deeper level. The sheer scale, texture, and detail of the pieces can only be truly appreciated in person. Moreover, museums and galleries provide a space for community and social interaction, where people can come together to learn, discuss, and appreciate art and history. Therefore, while the internet may provide convenience, it can never replace the value and experience of visiting public museums and art galleries. As such, these institutions will continue to play a vital role in preserving and showcasing our cultural heritage.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;The practice of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in British and Australian courts has sparked debate among lawyers. While some argue that juries should have access to all past facts, it is essential to consider the potential implications of such a change. In contrast to the UK and Australia, courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, which can influence their decision.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines future actions, suggesting that a defendant's previous crimes can indicate their likelihood of committing another offence. However, this perspective can lead to biased decision-making, where the jury's verdict is swayed by irrelevant information. The primary goal of a jury is to reach an objective decision based on the evidence presented in the particular case.To achieve this objective, it is crucial that the court only provides the jury with details relevant to the case at hand. Introducing a defendant's past criminal record can distract from the facts of the current case and lead to an unfair trial. The jury's role is to assess the evidence presented, not to make judgments based on a defendant's previous actions. By maintaining the current practice, British and Australian courts ensure that defendants receive a fair trial, where the jury's decision is based solely on the evidence relevant to the case. Ultimately, the integrity of the justice system relies on the ability of juries to make impartial decisions, and withholding a defendant's past record is essential to achieving this goal.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. With the advent of technology, university lecturers can now upload their lectures online, making it possible for students to access them remotely. This has led to a reduction in the importance of attending face-to-face lectures,. However, I firmly believe that the use of the Internet in formal education is a good idea,.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. The Internet provides students with a vast array of educational resources, including e-books, online tutorials, and educational videos. It also enables students to collaborate with their peers and lecturers from all over the world, fostering a global learning community. Furthermore, online lectures allow students to learn at their own pace, revisiting complex topics as many times as they need, thereby improving their understanding and retention of the material.Critics may argue that the Internet has several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively. For instance, the ease of access to information online can lead to plagiarism and academic dishonesty. Moreover, excessive use of the Internet can be a distraction, hindering students' ability to focus and engage with their studies. Nevertheless, I believe that these drawbacks can be mitigated through proper guidance and regulation. Ultimately, the benefits of the Internet in formal education far outweigh the drawbacks, and its use will continue to revolutionize the way we learn and teach. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential that we harness its power to enhance academic study, rather than resisting the change.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The issue of inaccessible medication in undeveloped countries is a pressing concern, as a large number of patients in these regions are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than the diseases themselves. It is a tragic reality that many people are dying from curable diseases simply because they cannot afford the necessary treatment. In light of this, it is suggested that pharmaceutical companies in developed countries ought to reduce the price of their medicines to make them more accessible to those in need.Proponents of this approach argue that drug companies have a moral obligation to make their products available at reduced prices in undeveloped countries, as it would help prevent unnecessary deaths. However, there is another side to this argument. The current cost of medicines is, in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. The research, development, and production of medicines require significant investment, and companies need to recoup these costs to sustain their operations.Furthermore, reducing prices without considering the underlying costs could have unintended consequences, such as compromising the quality of the medicines or limiting the companies' ability to invest in research and development of new treatments. A more nuanced approach might involve a combination of reduced prices, government subsidies, and international aid to make medicines more accessible to those in need. Ultimately, finding a solution to this complex issue will require a collaborative effort from pharmaceutical companies, governments, and international organizations to ensure that medicines are accessible to all, regardless of geographical location or economic means.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The issue of smoking in public places and offices has been a topic of debate in recent years. With the increasing awareness of the harmful effects of smoking among the general public, there has been significant pressure on governments and private sectors to take action. As a result, some businesses have prohibited smoking in their premises, and some governments have even banned smoking in all public places. I firmly agree with these measures, as they have numerous benefits for the health and image of a nation in the long run.The awareness of the harmful effects of smoking has put immense pressure on governments and private sectors to take measures to reduce smoking in public areas. As a result, many businesses have prohibited smoking in their offices, and some governments have restricted smoking in public areas. This move is a step in the right direction, as it helps to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke and discourages smokers from smoking in public.In the long run, this move will do more good by improving the quality of health and image of a nation. By restricting smoking in public places, governments can reduce the incidence of smoking-related illnesses, as well as the economic burden of healthcare costs associated with smoking. Moreover, a smoke-free nation projects a positive image, which can attract tourists, investors, and talent from around the world. This, in turn, can boost the economy and enhance the overall well-being of the nation.In conclusion, the measures taken by businesses and governments to prohibit smoking in offices and public places are a welcome step. The awareness of the harmful effects of smoking among the general public has led to this move, which will have numerous benefits for the health and image of a nation in the long run. I strongly agree with these measures and believe that they will contribute to a healthier and more prosperous nation.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"The debate about the impact of human activities on the Earth has been ongoing for years. While some argue that we are improving the quality of life on our planet, I firmly believe that our actions are causing harm to the Earth. The phrase ""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world, and for good reason. Concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons, and it is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the damage.One of the primary concerns is the large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners, which have depleted the ozone layer. This has severe consequences, including increased risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and disruption of ecosystems. Moreover, the excessive use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and pollution have all taken a toll on the health of our planet. The evidence is clear: human activities are having a devastating impact on the Earth's ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate.In contrast, the argument that we are improving the quality of life on Earth is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is true that human innovations and technologies have improved our standard of living, these advancements have come at a significant environmental cost. The damage caused by our actions will have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences, affecting not just our generation, but also future ones. Therefore, it is essential that we prioritize the health of our planet and take concrete steps to reduce our carbon footprint, invest in renewable energy, and protect natural habitats. The time to act is now, and it is our responsibility to save the planet Earth for future generations."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The notion that companies should encourage high-level employees older than 55 to retire to give opportunities to new generations has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach would pave the way for younger workers, I strongly disagree with this perspective. Sacrificing senior members to save young workers poses several negative influences that can have far-reaching consequences.From a personal level, this approach fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. Older employees who have dedicated their lives to the company feel undervalued and unappreciated, leading to a loss of dignity and self-respect. This can also create resentment among older workers, who may feel that their experience and knowledge are being discarded. Moreover, it can lead to a breakdown in intergenerational relationships, where younger workers may view older employees as obstacles to their progress, rather than as mentors and role models.Massively forcing early retirement would also be a significant financial burden to the local government. As a result, the government would have to provide financial support to these retirees, which could lead to an increased strain on the social security system. This could have long-term implications for the economy, as the government may struggle to provide adequate support to the growing number of retirees. Furthermore, it would also mean that the company would lose the valuable experience and expertise of older employees, which could negatively impact their operations and productivity.In conclusion, while the intention of giving opportunities to new generations may be noble, the approach of encouraging older employees to retire is misguided. It is essential to find alternative solutions that value and respect the contributions of all employees, regardless of age, and provide opportunities for growth and development for all generations.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The question of whether the media, including the press, TV, and internet, should be more strictly controlled has sparked a heated debate. A controversial issue related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions, and websites. In my opinion, I agree that controls should be implemented to some extent. One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content that is often broadcast or published. This is crucial in protecting the moral and psychological well-being of younger audiences who may be exposed to such content.Another supporting reason for media control is that television companies often import foreign programmes, which can sometimes promote ideas and values that may not align with the local culture. If left unregulated, audiences might accept these ideas without critically evaluating them, potentially leading to a loss of cultural identity. Furthermore, stricter controls can help prevent the spread of misinformation and propaganda, ensuring that citizens have access to reliable and trustworthy sources of information.On the other hand, one of the major opposing arguments is that controls can compromise the safety of citizens by limiting their access to information. However, I believe that with responsible regulation, the media can still provide citizens with the information they need while protecting them from harmful content. In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that some level of control is necessary to maintain a balance between freedom of information and protection of citizens. By implementing reasonable controls, we can ensure that the media serves the best interests of society as a whole.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The debate about the responsibilities of citizens has sparked a heated discussion among individuals. Some people believe that paying taxes is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities. In my opinion, I agree with the latter group, as I believe that being a citizen entails a wide range of duties beyond just paying taxes.In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. These laws are designed to maintain social order, protect individual rights, and ensure the overall well-being of the community. By obeying these laws, citizens demonstrate their respect for the system and contribute to the stability and security of the society. Furthermore, citizens should also protect the country's culture and history, which are essential components of a nation's identity. This can be achieved by preserving historical sites, participating in cultural events, and passing down traditional values to future generations.In addition to these responsibilities, citizens should also engage in community activities, such as volunteering, participating in local politics, and taking care of the environment. These actions not only benefit the individual but also contribute to the betterment of the society as a whole. In conclusion, paying taxes is just one aspect of being a responsible citizen. It is crucial for individuals to recognize that their responsibilities extend far beyond just financial contributions, and that active participation in maintaining law and order, preserving culture and history, and engaging in community activities are all essential to the development and prosperity of a country.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The debate on whether animal testing should be made illegal has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some argue that animal testing has led to numerous medical breakthroughs, including the discovery of cancer and HIV drugs, I firmly believe that testing on animals should be made illegal.On one hand, it is undeniable that animal testing has contributed significantly to medical advancements. Many life-saving treatments have been developed as a result of experiments conducted on animals. For instance, the development of cancer and HIV drugs has greatly improved the quality of life for millions of people worldwide. However, despite these benefits, there are several compelling reasons why animal testing should be banned.One of the primary concerns is the inhumane treatment of animals in laboratories. Animals are often kept in unnatural conditions, subjected to pain and distress, often without any form of pain relief. Moreover, the costs of animal testing far outweigh the benefits. The financial resources spent on animal testing could be better allocated to alternative methods of research, such as in vitro testing or computer simulations, which are not only more humane but also more reliable and efficient.Furthermore, the use of animal testing raises serious ethical concerns. Animals are sentient beings with the capacity to feel pain, joy, and suffering, and it is our moral obligation to treat them with respect and kindness. By banning animal testing, we would not only be upholding the principles of animal welfare but also promoting a more compassionate and humane society. In conclusion, while animal testing has contributed to medical advancements, the inhumane treatment of animals, the inefficiency of the practice, and the availability of alternative methods make a strong case for banning animal testing.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"The role of formal ""pen and paper"" examinations in assessing educational achievement has been a topic of debate among educators and scholars. Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. They have been used for centuries to evaluate students' knowledge and understanding of various subjects. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered, as they may not be the most effective way to assess learning.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates, allowing for a standardized evaluation of their knowledge. This ensures that all students are held to the same standards, and that the assessment is unbiased. Additionally, exams provide a clear and measurable outcome, which can be used to determine a student's academic progress and potential. They also encourage students to prepare thoroughly, as they know that their performance will be evaluated, which can motivate them to work harder and strive for excellence.Despite these advantages, there are also limitations to the use of examinations as a sole method of assessment. They can be stressful and intimidating for some students, which can affect their performance and lead to an inaccurate reflection of their abilities. Furthermore, exams may not be the best way to assess certain skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving, which are essential in the real world. Therefore, it is essential to reconsider the role of examinations and explore alternative methods of assessment that can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of students' learning and abilities. By doing so, we can ensure that our education system is fair, effective, and prepares students for success in their future endeavors."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of poorer nations is a pressing global issue that requires collective efforts from both richer and poorer countries. Improvements in health, education, and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations, as they provide the foundation for economic growth, social stability, and human well-being. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.In the health sector, richer nations can contribute significantly by delegating doctors and nurses to these poorer nations, as well as donating money to build hospitals and provide medical equipment. This can help to combat diseases, improve healthcare systems, and increase access to medical services. Furthermore, richer nations can also provide training and capacity-building programs for local healthcare professionals, enabling them to provide quality healthcare services to their communities.In the education sector, richer countries can offer scholarships and loans to qualified students from poorer nations, enabling them to pursue higher education and acquire skills that can contribute to the development of their countries. Additionally, richer nations can also provide educational resources, such as textbooks, computers, and other learning materials, to support the education system in poorer nations. This can help to improve literacy rates, increase access to education, and develop a skilled workforce that can drive economic growth and development.Ultimately, the development of poorer nations requires a collaborative effort from both richer and poorer countries. Richer nations have a moral and economic responsibility to support the development of poorer nations, and by doing so, they can help to create a more equitable and prosperous global community. By improving health, education, and trade, poorer nations can break the cycle of poverty and achieve sustainable development, and richer nations can play a critical role in supporting this process.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;The increasing use of computers in education has sparked a debate about the role of teachers in the classroom. While some may argue that computers will eventually replace teachers, I strongly disagree. Teachers are not just educators, they are also friends, confidants, and counselors who play a vital role in the emotional and social development of their students.A computer, no matter how advanced, can never replicate the human interaction and emotional connection that a teacher provides. Teachers are able to communicate with pupils on a personal level, understanding their individual needs, concerns, and motivations. They are able to offer guidance, support, and encouragement, which are essential for a student's academic and personal growth. Moreover, teachers are role models who inspire and motivate their students to strive for excellence, and their presence in the classroom is a crucial factor in shaping a student's values, attitudes, and behavior.In contrast, a computer is a mere machine that lacks the emotional intelligence, empathy, and compassion that a human teacher possesses. While computers can provide access to a wealth of information and educational resources, they are incapable of building relationships, providing emotional support, or offering personalized guidance. Furthermore, computers cannot replace the nuances of human communication, such as tone, facial expressions, and body language, which are essential for effective communication and learning.In conclusion, while computers are a valuable tool in education, they will never replace the role of teachers in the classroom. Teachers are not just dispensers of knowledge, but also friends, counselors, and mentors who provide a unique and indispensable support system that is essential for a student's overall development. As such, I firmly believe that teachers will continue to play a vital role in education, and computers will only serve as a complementary tool to enhance the learning experience.
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The production of food has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with the introduction of improved fertilisers and better machinery. Advanced plant foods, which incorporate with newly developed devices, have significantly reduced the cost of producing farm products. This has made food more affordable and accessible to a wider population. However, in my opinion, the benefits of cheaper food production come with a price that may not be worth paying.High-tech fertilizers, while effective in increasing crop yields, pose a potential threat to individuals' health and well-being. The chemicals used in these fertilizers can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to long-term health problems for those who consume the produce. Furthermore, excessive reliance on electronic equipment for harvesting and processing can cause several negative impacts on the society. Local communities may be displaced or marginalized as large-scale industrial farming takes over, leading to loss of traditional farming practices and cultural heritage.Moreover, the over-reliance on machinery and technology can also lead to unemployment and economic instability in rural areas. The benefits of cheaper food production are outweighed by the potential risks to human health and the negative effects on local communities. Therefore, I believe that a balanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account both the economic benefits of advanced farming techniques and the potential risks to human health and the environment. By adopting sustainable and responsible farming practices, we can ensure that food production is not only efficient and cost-effective but also safe and beneficial for both individuals and society as a whole.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The notion that governments should allocate their budget to other pressing matters rather than supporting artists has sparked a heated debate. There is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund artists, in favor of channeling resources into other areas. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.First and foremost, art plays a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of our lives. It serves as a medium of self-expression, allowing individuals to convey their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. By funding artists, governments enable them to create works that inspire, educate, and entertain the masses. Moreover, the preservation and promotion of art help to foster a sense of community and cultural identity, which are essential for the well-being of society.Another significant reason to support artists is the economic benefits they bring. Art attractions, such as museums, galleries, and festivals, are major draws for tourists. These events not only showcase local talent but also generate revenue for the local economy. By investing in artists, governments can promote tourism, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth. The influx of tourists also helps to preserve cultural heritage sites, which are often restored and maintained using funds generated from art-related tourism.In conclusion, the role of art in society is multifaceted, and its benefits extend beyond the artistic community. By continuing to fund artists, governments can improve the quality of life, promote cultural heritage, and boost local economies. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the suggestion that governments should cease funding artists, and instead, advocate for continued support to nurture and celebrate the creative talents that enrich our lives.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The development in technology has led to a plethora of environmental problems, ranging from pollution to climate change. In response to these issues, two distinct viewpoints have emerged. On one hand, some people argue that the solution lies in embracing a simpler way of life, where humans relinquish their reliance on technology and adopt more primitive methods of living. According to this perspective, if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life, then only can we save the environment. Proponents of this view believe that a return to basics will reduce our carbon footprint, minimize waste, and allow the natural world to heal.On the other hand, there are people who firmly believe that technology alone could solve the world's environmental problems. They argue that technological advancements can provide innovative solutions to the environmental challenges we face. In fact, we are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. For instance, renewable energy sources, sustainable architecture, and eco-friendly manufacturing processes are all examples of how technology can be harnessed to mitigate environmental damage.In my opinion, the latter viewpoint is more pragmatic and promising. While a simpler way of life may have its benefits, it is unrealistic to expect the global population to abandon technology entirely. Instead, we should focus on leveraging technology to develop sustainable solutions that can be implemented on a large scale. By doing so, we can reduce our environmental impact while still reaping the benefits of technological progress. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the best of technology with a commitment to sustainability is the most effective way to address the environmental problems we face.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The debate surrounding the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers has sparked intense discussion in recent years. Some people believe that these individuals are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, a closer examination of their contributions to society reveals that their pay may be excessive. While it is true that athletes and singers possess exceptional abilities that set them apart from others, it is debatable whether these talents warrant such astronomical salaries.On one hand, some argue that athletes and singers deserve their current salaries due to their unique skills and the immense entertainment value they provide to the public. For instance, a football star like Cristiano Ronaldo or a singer like Beyoncé can draw in millions of fans and generate significant revenue through merchandise, ticket sales, and endorsements. Their exceptional abilities and dedication to their craft have earned them a massive following, and their salaries reflect their market value.On the other hand, others claim that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of society. Compared to essential professions like doctors, teachers, or scientists, who work tirelessly to improve healthcare, education, and innovation, the contributions of athletes and singers may seem trivial. While they may bring joy and entertainment to people's lives, their work does not have a direct, tangible impact on the well-being of society as a whole. Furthermore, the disparity between their salaries and those of more crucial professions is staggering, with some athletes and singers earning more in a single year than a doctor or teacher might earn in a lifetime. Ultimately, the question remains whether the astronomical salaries of professional athletes and entertainers are justified, given their relatively limited contributions to the greater good of society.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The role of computers and the Internet in a child's education has sparked a heated debate in recent years. Some people think that these technological advancements are more important for a child's education than traditional schooling, while others believe that schools and teachers are essential for effective learning. On the one hand, it is generally believed that the Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in the not too distant future. The central argument supporting this view is that the global online network is an inexhaustible source of information, providing children with unparalleled access to knowledge and educational resources.Proponents of this idea argue that the Internet offers a more interactive and engaging learning experience, allowing children to explore and discover new concepts at their own pace. Moreover, the Internet's vast array of educational materials and online courses can cater to different learning styles and abilities, making it an attractive alternative to traditional classroom instruction. However, on the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. For instance, the lack of human interaction, guidance, and discipline that a traditional school setting provides can hinder a child's social and emotional development.In my opinion, while the Internet and computers are invaluable tools for learning, they should complement, rather than replace, the role of teachers and schools. The structured environment and personalized attention that schools offer are essential for children to learn effectively and develop important life skills. Therefore, a balanced approach that combines the benefits of technology with the guidance and support of teachers is likely to yield the best educational outcomes.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";"The implementation of capital punishment, the death penalty, has long been a controversial debate in many countries. The argument that it is necessary to control the amount of violent crimes in society is a complex one. On one hand, in a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, the death penalty may be seen as an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. The idea is that the severity of the punishment will serve as a deterrent, preventing individuals from committing heinous crimes. This perspective is grounded in the belief that the ultimate price for taking a life is the forfeiture of one's own.However, as society grows and evolves, human rights become more highly respected and valued. In this light, ""murdering"" criminals, even those who have committed the most atrocious acts, is therefore considered immoral and hard to accept. The sanctity of human life is a fundamental principle that underpins human rights, making the death penalty a violation of these rights. Furthermore, there is also the concern about the potential for wrongful convictions, where innocent lives could be lost due to judicial errors.In conclusion, while the death penalty may serve as a deterrent for violent crimes, its implementation raises significant moral and ethical concerns. As societies advance and place greater emphasis on human rights, the acceptability of capital punishment diminishes. It is crucial for nations to weigh these considerations carefully, potentially exploring alternative punishments that maintain public safety without compromising on the value of human life. Ultimately, the decision to implement or abolish the death penalty is a nuanced one, reflecting a society's values and its approach to justice, morality, and human rights."
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;"The statement ""businesses should do anything they can to make a profit"" is a highly debated topic. On one hand, there is no doubt that companies, factories, and businesses are established to provide products that meet people's needs and generate profits for their owners and managers. The primary goal of any business is to make a profit, and it is what drives innovation, investment, and economic growth.However, I strongly disagree with the statement. If there is no control or regulation on businesses, they may prioritize profits over the well-being of the environment and society. Without accountability, businesses may threaten the lives of humans, animals, and plants by engaging in unethical practices such as pollution, deforestation, and exploitation of natural resources. The consequences of unchecked business practices can be devastating, leading to environmental degradation, health problems, and social injustices.Furthermore, if businesses are allowed to do anything they can to make a profit, they may compromise on product quality and safety. They might produce low-quality products with high prices, taking advantage of consumers and putting their health and well-being at risk. This can lead to a loss of trust in businesses and damage to their reputation. In conclusion, while making a profit is essential for businesses, it should not come at the expense of social and environmental responsibility. Governments and regulatory bodies must establish and enforce laws and regulations to ensure that businesses operate in a way that is sustainable, ethical, and responsible. By doing so, we can promote a healthy and balanced economy that benefits both businesses and society as a whole."
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The recent announcement of a new high school potentially being built in our neighborhood has sparked a heated debate among community members. As a student, I wholeheartedly support this plan. Our current high school, which serves our district, is outdated and lacking in necessities that students need to thrive. The infrastructure is old, and the facilities are not equipped to provide students with the resources they require to succeed. This has led to an inferior learning environment, which can hinder students' academic and personal growth.On the other hand, the proposed new high school offers a plethora of benefits. Not only will it provide a modern and well-equipped learning environment, but it will also serve as a hub for new connections between students from different communities and districts of the city. This will foster a sense of unity and diversity, allowing students to interact and learn from one another. The new high school will be a melting pot of cultures, experiences, and perspectives, enriching the educational experience for all students.By attending a school with students from diverse backgrounds, we will gain invaluable insights into different ways of life, broaden our understanding of the world, and develop essential social skills. This, in turn, will prepare us to be active and engaged members of our community, capable of making a positive impact. Furthermore, the new high school will provide equal opportunities for students from all districts, bridging the gap between different communities and promoting social cohesion.In conclusion, I strongly support the plan to build a new high school in our neighborhood. It will not only address the inadequacies of our current school but also provide a unique opportunity for students to connect, learn, and grow together. I believe that this new high school will be a valuable asset to our community, and I look forward to being a part of it.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;As teenagers transition into young adulthood, the question of whether parents or adult relatives should make important decisions for them arises. In my opinion, I agree with the statement that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15-18 year old) teenage children. Teenagers, especially those between the ages of 15 and 18, are at a critical stage of development where they need more attention and help in comparison to older individuals. During this phase, they are still learning to navigate the world and make sense of their surroundings. As a result, they often require guidance and support to ensure they make informed decisions. There is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced and knowledgeable than their teenage children. Having lived through various life experiences, they have gained valuable insights and wisdom that can help their children avoid potential pitfalls. As such, they are the best advisors for their children, providing them with sage counsel and direction. Furthermore, by making important decisions, parents and adult relatives can also help their teenage children save valuable resources such as time and money. With their expertise, they can help their children prioritize their goals, manage their finances effectively, and make smart choices that will benefit them in the long run. This, in turn, can prevent unnecessary mistakes and regrets that may arise from impulsive decisions made by inexperienced teenagers. In conclusion, given the vulnerability and inexperience of teenagers, it is reasonable to argue that parents or other adult relatives should play a significant role in making important decisions for their older teenage children. By doing so, they can provide their children with the necessary support, guidance, and expertise to navigate this critical stage of development and set them up for success in life.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;"The statement ""Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" has sparked a heated debate among people. While some argue that adulthood brings more joy and fulfillment, others claim that childhood is the most carefree and joyful stage of life. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of a person's life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free to do whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitations are really rare. They can play, imagine, and explore without the burden of responsibilities, allowing them to express themselves freely and live in the moment. This unrestricted freedom enables them to experience life with an unbridled sense of wonder and curiosity, making their childhood years truly unforgettable.In addition, in this age, they do not have to educate and to work, so they have a lot of time in their hands to enjoy this stage of their life. Without the pressure of exams, assignments, and deadlines, children can focus on playing, learning, and growing at their own pace. They can also spend quality time with family and friends, creating lasting bonds and memories that will stay with them forever. The absence of adult worries and concerns allows children to live a life filled with laughter, excitement, and joy, making childhood a truly happy and carefree experience.Overall, childhood is a time of innocence, curiosity, and wonder, where children can live life to the fullest without the burdens and responsibilities of adulthood. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life, and believe that it is a stage that should be cherished and nurtured."
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;People attend college and university for a multitude of reasons, ranging from personal growth to career advancement. In my opinion, the primary motivations for pursuing higher education are to develop a deeper understanding of the world, prepare for a career, and acquire essential life skills. University is an ideal place for people to develop their understanding of various subjects, expand their knowledge, and nurture their critical thinking abilities. Through academic courses, seminars, and workshops, students are exposed to diverse perspectives, fostering a more informed and open-minded individual.Preparing for a career is an essential function of university education. Many students enroll in college with the primary goal of securing a well-paying job after graduation. Universities offer specialized programs, as well as resources such as career counseling and job fairs, to facilitate this process. Moreover, the university experience equips students with skills that are highly valued by employers, including teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.However, the university experience extends beyond the classroom. Students are not only expected to complete homework, assignments, and attend classes, but also to participate in extracurricular activities such as volunteer work and internships. These experiences provide students with practical skills, networking opportunities, and a chance to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world settings. For instance, volunteer work helps students develop empathy and social responsibility, while internships offer a glimpse into their chosen profession, allowing them to make informed decisions about their career paths. In conclusion, attending college and university is a multifaceted decision, driven by the desire for knowledge, career preparation, and personal growth. By offering a comprehensive education, universities play a pivotal role in shaping individuals who are not only academically proficient but also socially conscious and professionally capable.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The age-old debate about the importance of friendship has sparked a intriguing question: is it better to have one or two close friends or a large number of casual acquaintances? In my opinion, I firmly agree that having one or two close friends is more valuable than having a large number of casual acquaintances.A friend is a person you care about, a person with whom you share a deep and meaningful connection. Close friends provide emotional support, a sense of belonging, and a feeling of being understood. They are the ones who will be there for you through thick and thin, offering a listening ear, a comforting word, or a helping hand. In contrast, casual acquaintances may provide fleeting moments of social interaction, but they often lack the depth and intimacy that close friendships offer.Having one or two close friends allows for a more profound and lasting relationship. You can invest time and energy into nurturing these relationships, fostering trust, empathy, and mutual understanding. With close friends, you can share your thoughts, feelings, and experiences without fear of judgment, creating a safe and supportive environment. Furthermore, having a small circle of close friends encourages meaningful communication, conflict resolution, and personal growth.In conclusion, while having a large number of casual acquaintances may have its benefits, I believe that having one or two close friends is ultimately more rewarding. A friend is a person you care about, and investing in a few, meaningful relationships can lead to a more fulfilling and happier life. By prioritizing close friendships, we can cultivate a sense of belonging, emotional support, and lasting connections that bring joy and purpose to our lives.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";I disagree with the statement that life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents were children. In fact, life today is totally different from half a century before, and in my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is that life is simple in the past. Without the burden of modern technology and social media, people had more time to focus on their relationships, hobbies, and personal growth. They had a stronger sense of community and connection with nature, which contributed to their overall well-being. In contrast, today's fast-paced and complex lifestyle can be overwhelming and stressful.Second, the environment today is seriously damaged. The rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to pollution, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. Our grandparents grew up in a cleaner and healthier environment, where they could breathe fresh air, drink clean water, and enjoy the beauty of nature. The degradation of the environment has significant impacts on our physical and mental health, making life today more challenging than it was in the past.Third, the pace of life is another factor that contributes to the decrease in happiness. The modern world is characterized by a frenetic pace, where people are constantly connected to their devices and feel pressured to be productive. In contrast, life in the old days was more relaxed, and people had time to enjoy the simple pleasures of life, such as spending time with family and friends, or engaging in leisure activities. The slower pace of life allowed people to appreciate the beauty of the world around them and find joy in everyday moments.In conclusion, while life today may have its advantages, I believe that life in the old days was more conducive to happiness due to its simplicity, cleaner environment, and slower pace. These factors allowed people to live a more balanced, connected, and fulfilling life, which is essential for true happiness.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;The debate about whether high school students should be allowed to study the courses they want has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that high school should permit students to choose courses they want. High school is a critical period when students decide their future career and the particular field they want to concentrate on. It is a time when students start to explore their interests and aptitudes, and allowing them to choose their courses can have a significant impact on their academic and professional lives.There are several reasons why I believe high school should allow students to choose their courses. Firstly, it provides students with the freedom of choice, which is essential for their academic and personal growth. When students are allowed to choose courses that align with their interests, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their studies. Secondly, it can lead to progress in students' grades and knowledge. When students are studying courses they are passionate about, they tend to perform better and retain more information. Finally, allowing students to choose their courses can help them explore their aptitude and discover their strengths and weaknesses. This can be invaluable in helping students make informed decisions about their future careers and fields of study.By permitting students to choose their courses, high schools can provide students with a more personalized and effective learning experience. This can lead to better academic outcomes, increased student motivation, and a more successful transition to higher education and the workforce. In conclusion, I firmly believe that high school should allow students to study the courses they want, as it provides them with the freedom of choice, leads to progress in their grades and knowledge, and helps them explore their aptitude.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The debate about whether to rush through life or take it easy has sparked a longstanding discussion. Some people tend to be in a hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position, adopting a slower pace. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also developed my own perspective. As a firm believer in the importance of time management, I prefer to be in a hurry to go places and get things done.The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks. In today's fast-paced world, where deadlines are tight and responsibilities are numerous, being quick and efficient is essential. By hurrying to complete tasks, I can manage my time effectively, free up space for other activities, and ultimately achieve more in less time. For instance, when working on a project, hurrying to finish the initial stages allows me to have ample time for revisions and improvements, thereby ensuring a better outcome.Another equally important aspect is that keeping in a high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. When I'm in a hurry, I stay focused and motivated, which enables me to push through challenges and maintain productivity. This, in turn, helps me develop a strong work ethic and build momentum, making it easier to tackle subsequent tasks. Furthermore, being in a hurry encourages me to prioritize tasks, make smart decisions, and avoid procrastination, all of which are valuable skills for success in both personal and professional spheres. In conclusion, I firmly believe that being in a hurry to go places and get things done is the better approach, as it allows me to make the most of my time, stay motivated, and achieve my goals efficiently.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism industry has become a significant contributor to the global economy, with billions of dollars being generated annually. In my opinion, tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region, creating a ripple effect that benefits the local community. One of the most notable advantages of tourism is the creation of jobs, both direct and indirect. The industry provides employment opportunities in various sectors, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and the service industry. This not only improves the standard of living for individuals but also contributes to the overall economic growth of the region.However, some people may oppose tourism, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by the influx of tourists. It is true that unregulated tourism can lead to pollution, destruction of natural habitats, and erosion of cultural heritage. Over-tourism can also put a strain on local resources, leading to issues such as overcrowding, traffic congestion, and strain on infrastructure. Nevertheless, I believe that these negative impacts can be mitigated with proper planning, management, and regulation.Many countries and regions have successfully implemented sustainable tourism practices, which prioritize environmental conservation and cultural preservation. By adopting such practices, tourism can become a tool for economic development while also protecting the local environment and culture. In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of tourism, I firmly believe that its benefits outweigh the drawbacks. With responsible management and planning, tourism can be a powerful driver of economic growth, job creation, and community development, ultimately improving the lives of people in the region.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. Some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is a waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services. However, I contend that this investment in the field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.Allocating funds to the arts, such as music, painting, and other creative pursuits, may seem frivolous to some, but it has numerous benefits that can have a positive impact on the community. For instance, art programs can provide a platform for social commentary, fostering critical thinking and sparking conversations about important issues. Moreover, art can also play a significant role in promoting cultural diversity and preserving national heritage. By investing in the arts, the government can promote tourism, create jobs, and stimulate local economies.Furthermore, the arts have been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and education. Studies have shown that exposure to art can improve cognitive function, boost self-esteem, and enhance academic performance. Additionally, the arts can provide a healthy outlet for emotional expression and stress relief, contributing to a more well-rounded and balanced society.In conclusion, while some may view the allocation of funds to the arts as a waste of resources, I firmly believe that it is a vital investment in the well-being and development of a society. Rather than diverting funds from public services, the government should strive to find a balance between supporting essential services and nurturing the creative sector. By doing so, they can create a more vibrant, diverse, and prosperous community that benefits from the numerous advantages that the arts have to offer.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The notion of having a single career is rapidly becoming a relic of the past. In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving job market, the trend is shifting towards having multiple careers or sources of income. This shift is particularly evident among the new generation, who are more inclined to explore diverse career paths and pursue multiple higher educational certificates. The primary motivation behind this trend is the desire to earn a higher income and achieve financial security.In the past, a full-time job with a steady income was sufficient for an individual to support themselves and their family. However, the recent recession has led to a significant economic downturn worldwide, rendering this traditional approach insufficient. The economic instability has prompted individuals to rethink their career strategies and seek alternative sources of income. As a result, many are now opting for multiple careers, which can provide a safety net and increased financial stability.Furthermore, the pursuit of multiple higher educational certificates has become a norm among the new generation. This approach not only enhances one's skill set and knowledge but also opens up new career opportunities. The concept of lifelong learning has gained prominence, with many individuals choosing to continue their education throughout their lives. This ongoing pursuit of knowledge and skills enables them to stay adaptable and competitive in the job market, ultimately leading to greater financial security and stability. In conclusion, the idea of having a single career is indeed becoming outdated, and the new trend of pursuing multiple careers and continuous education is likely to dominate the future of employment.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The impact of computers on society has been a topic of debate in recent years. Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. They argue that computers have led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, resulting in social isolation and decreased human relationships. Moreover, they claim that the over-reliance on computers has made people lazy and dependent on technology, hindering their ability to think critically and solve problems independently.However, I strongly believe that computers can have a profoundly positive influence on society, and people's lives have already been significantly controlled by these devices. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and perform various tasks. They have enabled global connectivity, facilitating instant communication and collaboration across geographical boundaries. Additionally, computers have improved efficiency and productivity in various industries, such as healthcare, education, and finance, leading to better services and outcomes.Furthermore, computers have opened up new avenues for entertainment, education, and personal development. They provide access to a vast array of educational resources, enabling people to acquire new skills and knowledge. Computers have also enabled people to work remotely, offering flexibility and convenience. In conclusion, while some people may view computers as a hindrance, I firmly believe that they are an indispensable tool that has transformed and will continue to shape our lives and society for the better. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential to harness its potential to improve our lives and create a more connected and productive world.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The debate about what makes a suitable candidate for a job has been ongoing, with some employers emphasizing the importance of social skills, while others still prioritize qualifications. In recent years, there has been a growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications, such as social skills, in their employee selection process. This shift in focus is driven by the realization that social skills, including communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, are essential for effective collaboration and productivity in the workplace.On one hand, qualifications are undoubtedly important, as they demonstrate a candidate's knowledge and expertise in a particular field. Employers who prioritize qualifications argue that they provide a clear indication of a candidate's ability to perform specific tasks and duties. Moreover, qualifications are often seen as a reliable measure of a candidate's commitment to their profession and their willingness to invest time and effort in acquiring the necessary skills.On the other hand, social skills are becoming increasingly valued by employers, as they recognize that a candidate's ability to work with others, communicate effectively, and adapt to new situations is crucial for success in today's fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Employers who prioritize social skills argue that these skills are essential for building strong relationships with colleagues, clients, and customers, and for driving business results through effective teamwork and collaboration.In my opinion, while qualifications provide a foundation for a candidate's technical abilities, social skills are equally important in determining a candidate's potential for success in the workplace. I believe that employers should strike a balance between the two, considering both qualifications and social skills in their selection process. By doing so, employers can ensure that they hire candidates who not only possess the necessary technical skills but also the social skills required to thrive in a team-based work environment. Ultimately, this balanced approach will lead to more effective and productive teams, driving business success and growth.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The debate on whether charities should prioritize aid to those in need globally or focus on their own countries has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some argue that charities should provide aid to those who need it most, regardless of their geographical location. International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems that require immediate attention. For instance, many people, especially in some African countries, are living below the basic standards of living, lacking access to fundamental necessities like clean water, food, and shelter. In such cases, providing aid can be a matter of life and death.On the other hand, some people believe that charity organizations would be better off concentrating on people in their own countries. This perspective is also understandable, as there are often significant needs within one's own nation that require attention. Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens who may be struggling with poverty, homelessness, or other socio-economic challenges. By supporting local communities, charities can foster a sense of unity and contribute to the overall well-being of their country.In my opinion, a balanced approach is the most effective way forward. Charities should not have to choose between helping those abroad and those at home. Instead, they can allocate their resources in a way that addresses both international and domestic needs. This could involve partnering with international organizations to provide global aid while also maintaining local programs that support community development and welfare. By adopting such a dual-focus strategy, charities can make a positive impact both at home and abroad, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and compassionate world.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations. The increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change, making it easier for students to access a wide range of information from various sources. While some may argue that students learn more from lessons with teachers than from other sources, I partially disagree with this statement.On one hand, teachers play a vital role in providing guidance, support, and feedback to students, which are essential for their academic and personal development. Face-to-face interaction with educators allows students to ask questions, clarify doubts, and engage in discussions, promoting a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Furthermore, teachers can tailor their teaching methods to meet the needs of individual students, making learning more effective.On the other hand, alternative sources such as the internet and television also offer a wealth of information that can supplement traditional teaching methods. The internet, in particular, provides access to a vast array of educational resources, including online tutorials, educational videos, and interactive learning materials. These alternative sources can be especially useful for students who prefer self-paced learning or need to review material outside of the classroom.In conclusion, both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge. Rather than relying solely on one or the other, a balanced approach that combines the strengths of both is likely to yield the best results. By leveraging the benefits of modern technology and the guidance of teachers, students can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in today's rapidly changing world.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";The notion that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions play a crucial role in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. I agree to a certain extent with this opinion. On one hand, the football World Cup, for instance, is a world sportive competition event that is watched by almost every country around the world. This global event provides a social stimulus, bringing people together and fostering a sense of community and camaraderie. The excitement and pride associated with watching one's national team compete can be a powerful catalyst for patriotic emotions, which can be released in a safe and controlled environment.Moreover, these events have the potential to transcend cultural and linguistic barriers, promoting international unity and understanding. The sheer scale of these events, with millions of people gathering to watch and celebrate, creates a shared experience that can help to break down national and cultural divides. However, while many people view these sportive events as vital in releasing international problems and easing tensions, others think that they are just entertainment, designed to distract people from more pressing global issues. Some critics argue that the euphoria and national pride generated by these events can also be a source of division and conflict, rather than unity and cooperation.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the football World Cup have the potential to ease international tensions and release patriotic emotions in a safe way, their impact should not be overstated. They can be a powerful tool for promoting international unity and understanding, but they should not be seen as a substitute for meaningful diplomatic efforts to address the complex problems that face the global community. Ultimately, the value of these events lies in their ability to bring people together and foster a sense of shared humanity, rather than as a means of distracting from or resolving deeper international conflicts.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way people access education, with many opting to study from the comfort of their homes. While some argue that this method of learning cannot compare to the traditional college or university experience, I strongly disagree. In fact, distance-learning programs offer a multitude of benefits that make them an attractive alternative to conventional education.One of the most significant advantages of distance learning is the ability to cut down on unnecessary expenses. With just an internet connection, students can access study materials, thereby eliminating the need for commuting, which in turn reduces costs associated with transportation, tuition fees, and textbook fees. This makes quality education more accessible and affordable to a wider range of people, including those who may be financially constrained or have mobility issues.Moreover, long-distance education provides students with the unparalleled opportunity to access immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches that might not be available locally. The internet is replete with educational resources, including online lectures, e-books, and interactive learning platforms, which cater to different learning styles and preferences. This diversity in educational content ensures that students can engage with materials in a way that is most effective for them, potentially leading to better learning outcomes.In conclusion, distance-learning programs are not only a viable alternative but also a beneficial one, offering flexibility, cost savings, and unparalleled access to educational resources. As technology continues to advance, the quality and accessibility of distance learning will only improve, making it an increasingly attractive option for those seeking to further their education. Therefore, I firmly believe that distance learning can indeed bring as many benefits as attending a college or university, if not more.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The issue of extinct species has sparked a heated debate about whether we should prioritize protecting animals from dying out or focus on human problems. On one hand, animal protectionists argue that safeguarding endangered species is crucial for maintaining the balance of our ecosystem. They base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to preserve the delicate harmony of nature. By protecting animals, we ensure that the ecosystem remains intact, which in turn supports human life and well-being. For instance, the loss of pollinators like bees can have devastating effects on our food supply, highlighting the interconnectedness of species and ecosystems.On the other hand, some people contend that we should concentrate more on problems affecting human beings, such as poverty, disease, and inequality. They point out that extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution, where species adapt and evolve or face extinction. Moreover, the environment on Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being, with natural events like climate change and geological upheavals leading to the demise of certain species. From this perspective, human issues take precedence over animal conservation.In my opinion, while human problems are undoubtedly pressing, I believe that animal protection and conservation are equally important. The loss of species can have unforeseen and far-reaching consequences for the health of our planet. Furthermore, many human problems, such as poverty and disease, are intricately linked to environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity. Therefore, I think that we should strive to find a balance between addressing human issues and protecting endangered species, recognizing that the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants are inextricably linked. By preserving biodiversity, we ultimately ensure the long-term survival and prosperity of human societies.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. With this in mind, the question of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is a contentious issue. In my personal opinion, there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university course. This stance is grounded in the principle of equality and fairness, which are essential for fostering a just and progressive society.There appear to be various reasons that often strike in my mind in support of this position. Firstly, accepting equal numbers of male and female students promotes diversity and inclusivity, which are crucial for a rich and vibrant academic environment. When both genders are represented equally, it encourages a broader range of perspectives, leading to more comprehensive and balanced discussions. Furthermore, equal representation helps to break down gender stereotypes and biases that may exist in certain subjects, thereby promoting a more level playing field for all students.Moreover, ensuring equal numbers of male and female students in every subject can help address historical imbalances and promote gender equality in fields where one gender has traditionally been underrepresented. This is particularly significant in subjects like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where women have often been minority. By actively working towards parity, universities can play a pivotal role in challenging and changing these dynamics, contributing to a more equitable society.In conclusion, the principle of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject aligns with the values of equality, fairness, and progress. It is not only a matter of social justice but also a strategy to enrich academic environments and prepare students for a world where collaboration and mutual respect between genders are paramount. Therefore, I strongly agree that universities should strive for this balance, as it reflects a commitment to providing equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The significant advancement in medical care has led to a substantial increase in life expectancy. Advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy, allowing people to live longer and healthier lives. The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care of, resulting in good health and a higher quality of life. This development has numerous benefits, outweighing the disadvantages.A community with a significant number of healthy elderly individuals has a major role to play in the sustainable development of a society. The experience and wisdom that older generations possess can be invaluable assets to the community. They can share their knowledge, provide guidance, and contribute to the social and economic development of the society. Furthermore, a healthy elderly population can also reduce the burden on the healthcare system, as they require less medical attention and care.In conclusion, the improvement in life expectancy due to advanced medical care is a positive development that has numerous benefits for individuals and society as a whole. While there may be some disadvantages, such as increased pressure on pension and social security systems, the advantages of a healthy and experienced elderly population far outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, it is essential to continue investing in advanced medical care to ensure that people can live long, healthy, and productive lives, contributing to the sustainable development of our society. By doing so, we can create a brighter future for generations to come.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, with differing opinions on who should have access to higher education. While some argue that college or university education should be available to all students, others believe that it should be reserved for good students. In my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.Focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. When universities accept only good students, they can ensure that their programs are being utilized effectively, and that students are able to fully grasp and apply the knowledge and skills being taught. This, in turn, enables academic institutions to produce high-caliber graduates who are well-equipped to contribute to their respective fields.Furthermore, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. By selectively admitting top students, universities can cultivate a pool of talented and dedicated individuals who are capable of driving innovation, innovation, and progress in various industries. This selective approach to admission not only benefits the students themselves but also society as a whole, as it ensures that the most talented and motivated individuals are being educated and trained to tackle complex challenges and make meaningful contributions.In conclusion, while making higher education available to all students may seem like an equitable approach, I firmly believe that reserving it for good students is the more effective and beneficial strategy. By doing so, academic institutions can maintain their standards, produce high-quality graduates, and ultimately provide society with the skilled and knowledgeable human resources it needs to thrive.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The debate about how universities should allocate their resources has sparked a longstanding discussion. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, such as laboratories and general infrastructure, while others seem to believe that hiring famous teachers is more conducive to students' learning experiences. In my opinion, I agree that universities spend money on improving facilities better than hiring famous teachers.On one hand, hiring renowned educators can undoubtedly bring prestige and intellectual stimulation to a university. Famous teachers can share their valuable insights and experiences, offering students a unique opportunity to learn from the best in their field. However, the benefits of hiring famous teachers are somewhat limited. Once the teacher leaves, the university is left with the same outdated facilities, which can hinder the learning process and stifle innovation.On the other hand, improving facilities provides a more sustainable and far-reaching impact on students' educational experience. State-of-the-art laboratories, advanced technology, and well-maintained infrastructure can enhance the overall learning environment, fostering a more engaging and effective learning experience. Modern facilities can also attract more students, faculty, and research grants, ultimately leading to a more vibrant academic community. Moreover, improved facilities can accommodate a larger number of students, providing equal opportunities for learning and growth.Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for schools because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. By investing in facilities, universities can create a conducive learning environment that benefits all students, regardless of the teachers they have. In conclusion, while hiring famous teachers has its merits, I firmly believe that improving facilities is a more prudent and beneficial investment for universities, leading to a better educational experience for students.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;The statement that high schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study is one that I strongly agree with. Allowing students to explore their interests and passions can have a profound impact on their academic and personal growth. It is essential for students to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested, as this can foster a sense of excitement and motivation towards learning.Moreover, students should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects. By exploring various fields, such as science, math, humanities, or languages, they can gain a deeper understanding of what truly captivates them. For instance, a student may think they are interested in pursuing a career in engineering, but after taking a course in psychology, they may discover a new passion. By allowing students to study the courses they want, they can make informed decisions about their future academic and career paths.Additionally, tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. High school is a critical period for students to lay the foundation for their future studies. By permitting students to study the courses they are interested in, high schools can help them develop a strong foundation in their desired field, and better prepare them for the specialization that will occur at the university level. This, in turn, can lead to greater academic success and a more fulfilling university experience.In conclusion, allowing high school students to study the courses they want is crucial for their academic and personal development. It enables them to discover their true interests, make informed decisions about their future, and prepare for specialization at the university level. By giving students the autonomy to choose their courses, high schools can empower them to take ownership of their learning and set them up for success in their future academic pursuits.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;The statement that games are as important for adults as they are for children has sparked a heated debate. While some people think that adults need playing games as children do, providing them with essential skills such as problem-solving and teamwork, I disagree. In my opinion, games are no longer too important for adults for several reasons.Firstly, the pressure of work and family commitments force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, including playing games. Adults have numerous responsibilities, such as providing for their families, paying bills, and managing their careers, which leave them with little time for leisure activities like gaming. As a result, they often have to prioritize their obligations over their personal interests.Moreover, adults' physical and mental needs are different from those of children. While games can be beneficial for children's cognitive and motor skills development, adults require more practical and relevant activities to maintain their well-being. For instance, exercise, reading, or spending time with family and friends are more essential for adults' physical and mental health.Additionally, the nature of games has changed significantly over the years, with many games now being designed specifically for children or younger audiences. The complexity and content of these games may not appeal to adults, who may find them immature or uninteresting. In contrast, adults may prefer more mature and intellectually stimulating activities, such as puzzles, strategy games, or educational programs.In conclusion, while games can be beneficial for adults, I believe that they are not as important for them as they are for children. The demands of adulthood, combined with the different needs and preferences of adults, make games a less significant part of their lives.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";The advent of modern technology has led to a significant impact on cultures around the world, and I agree that it is creating a single world culture. The widespread use of technology has bridged geographical gaps, allowing people from different cultures to connect and share ideas. As a result, we can observe many similarities emerging across cultures. For instance, students in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or give presentations as their counterparts in Canada. This homogenization of technological tools is a clear indicator that a single modern culture is being created.A single modern culture is being created by modern technology for several reasons. Firstly, the internet and social media platforms have made it possible for people to access and share information from anywhere in the world. This has led to a globalization of ideas, values, and beliefs, which are being adopted by people across different cultures. Secondly, the use of similar technological tools and platforms has created a sense of uniformity, where people from different cultures are using the same language, symbols, and imagery to communicate and express themselves.Furthermore, modern technology has also led to the emergence of global trends and fashions, which are being followed by people across different cultures. For example, the use of smartphones, online shopping, and streaming services are becoming increasingly popular across the world, transcending cultural boundaries. In conclusion, the impact of modern technology on cultures is undeniable, and it is clear that a single modern culture is being created. As technology continues to advance and spread, we can expect to see even more similarities emerging across cultures, ultimately leading to a more homogenized and interconnected world.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The statement that nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what it was before has sparked a heated debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assistance from family is quite an essential factor in one's success. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursue success. There are a couple of reasons that support this view.Firstly, the financial support provided by family can greatly alleviate the burden of achieving success. With the rising costs of education and living expenses, it is becoming increasingly difficult for individuals to make ends meet, let alone pursue their goals. Family assistance, whether it be financial or emotional, can provide a safety net, allowing individuals to take risks and focus on their passions. For instance, many entrepreneurs rely on family loans or investments to get their businesses off the ground.Secondly, the emotional support and guidance provided by family can be just as valuable as financial assistance. Having a supportive family can provide a sense of security and motivation, driving individuals to work harder and push through challenges. Additionally, family members can offer valuable advice and mentorship, helping individuals navigate the complexities of their chosen path. For example, a parent who has experience in a particular field can provide invaluable guidance and connections to their child.In conclusion, while some may argue that success is solely dependent on individual effort, I firmly believe that family plays a significant role in helping one achieve success. The financial and emotional support provided by family can be a crucial factor in overcoming obstacles and staying motivated. As such, I agree that nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what it was before.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";The statement that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies has sparked a debate among book lovers and movie enthusiasts. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement. Reading fiction, such as novels and short stories, is more enjoyable than watching movies for several compelling reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the world created by the author. Unlike movies, which are limited by time and visuals, novels can delve deeper into the characters' thoughts, feelings, and backstories, providing a richer and more engaging experience. This level of detail enables readers to develop a more profound connection with the story and its characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient than watching a movie. Many novels have around 100 pages or less, making them easily consumable in short periods. In contrast, movies typically require a significant time commitment, often exceeding two hours. This makes it challenging for individuals with busy schedules, like students, to watch a complete movie. For instance, I often find myself with only 15 minutes of free time before I need to study, which is insufficient to watch a movie, but perfect for reading a few chapters of a book.In conclusion, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies due to its attention to detail and convenience. The ability to fully engage with a story, combined with the flexibility to read at one's own pace, makes reading fiction a more enjoyable and practical option for many people. As a student, I can attest that reading fiction provides a welcome escape from the demands of academic life, and I believe that others will find it equally rewarding.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The phenomenon of language death has sparked a heated debate about its implications on the world. Several languages die every year, and many people believe that a world with fewer languages promotes harmony and understanding between people. On one hand, some people argue that using a single language throughout the world is a positive change, which is helping the world to become a better place to live. They contend that a world with fewer languages will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities, such as ordering food in a restaurant or navigating unfamiliar places. For instance, a traveler who only speaks English can easily communicate with locals in countries where English is widely spoken, making their experience more enjoyable and hassle-free.Moreover, a single language also reduces misunderstandings between people, facilitating global communication and fostering international relationships. In a world where everyone speaks the same language, conflicts and miscommunications caused by language barriers can be minimized, leading to greater cooperation and understanding among nations. On the other hand, however, I believe that the loss of languages is a cultural tragedy, as each language represents a unique perspective and way of life. The homogenization of languages can lead to a loss of cultural diversity and identity, making the world a less rich and interesting place. In conclusion, while a single language may have its advantages, I think that the importance of preserving linguistic diversity and cultural heritage outweighs the benefits of a single global language. Efforts should be made to document and preserve endangered languages, rather than promoting a single language at the expense of others.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The notion that elderly people often hold, that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today, is a topic of debate. While some may agree with this sentiment, I firmly disagree. In my opinion, the advancements of modern society have greatly improved the quality of life, making it more convenient, healthier, and happier.We live in an era where technology is developing at the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. With just a few clicks, we can access a vast amount of information, communicate with people across the globe, and perform various tasks with ease. This has opened up numerous opportunities for people to connect, learn, and grow. For instance, online shopping and food delivery services have made it possible for elderly people to access essential goods and services from the comfort of their own homes, reducing their need to venture out and exert themselves.Furthermore, the phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human beings, making the world a healthier and thus, a happier place to live in. Advances in medical technology have led to the development of new treatments, medicines, and diagnostic tools, significantly improving life expectancy and quality of life. For example, diseases that were once considered incurable are now being treated and managed effectively, thanks to the relentless efforts of medical scientists and researchers. This progress has greatly benefited elderly people, enabling them to live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.In conclusion, while the past may have had its charms, I believe that the present day offers numerous advantages that make life simpler, healthier, and happier. The rapid development of technology and medical science has been instrumental in shaping a better world, and I firmly disagree with the notion that the past was better.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;The notion of teaching financial management to secondary and higher school students has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that introducing money math to juveniles may have adverse effects, others believe that it is an essential life skill that should be imparted to students at a young age. In my opinion, I strongly agree that higher school students should be educated on how to manage money effectively.Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate, with some people feeling that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. They argue that it may lead to an overemphasis on materialism and a lack of focus on academic pursuits. However, I disagree with this perspective. I believe that teaching financial literacy to higher school students can have numerous benefits, such as promoting responsible spending habits,In my view, I agree to the fact that higher school students should be made aware of money management. At this stage, students are on the cusp of adulthood and are likely to be making independent financial decisions soon. By educating them on how to budget, save, and invest, we can empower them to make informed choices about their financial future. Moreover, it can also help them avoid common pitfalls such as debt and financial fraud. By incorporating financial management into the school curriculum, we can equip students with a vital life skill that will benefit them throughout their lives. Ultimately, I firmly believe that teaching financial management to higher school students is a prudent decision that can have long-term benefits for their financial well-being.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and that state laws prohibiting it should be upheld. One of the primary reasons for this stance is the discomfort it causes to non-smokers. When smoking is allowed in restaurants, it forces non-smokers to breathe in second-hand smoke, making their dining experience uncomfortable and potentially hazardous to their health.Restaurants are establishments where people go to enjoy their meals and pay for a pleasant experience. Allowing smoking in these places undermines the purpose of dining out, which is to relax and savor good food in a comfortable environment. Moreover, smoking in restaurants sets a bad example for children, grandparents, and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoke. It is especially concerning for these groups as they may not have the ability to remove themselves from the smoking environment.Furthermore, it is fundamentally unfair to passive smokers who, despite not smoking themselves, are exposed to the same health risks as active smokers due to second-hand smoke inhalation. The risks associated with passive smoking, including respiratory problems and increased risk of cancer, make it a significant public health concern. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we can protect the health and well-being of all patrons, ensuring that everyone can enjoy their meals without compromising their health. In conclusion, upholding state laws that prohibit smoking in restaurants is not only reasonable but necessary to protect public health and ensure a comfortable dining experience for all.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The statement that growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way is one that I strongly agree with. Over the past 20 years, there has been a noticeable increase in violent behavior depicted in films. This trend has been exploited by the film industry as a means to advertise and promote movies, with the aim of attracting larger audiences and generating more revenue. However, from my point of view, the inclusion of violence in movies has profound negative effects on youngsters, particularly in terms of their behavior, emotional well-being, and academic performance.The depiction of violence in films can desensitize youngsters to the consequences of aggressive behavior, leading them to view it as a normal or acceptable way to resolve conflicts. This can result in an increase in violent behavior among young people, as they may mimic the actions they see on screen. Furthermore, exposure to violent content can also affect youngsters' emotional stability, causing them to become more anxious, fearful, or aggressive. The constant bombardment of violent images can shape their perceptions of the world, making them more prone to violence and less empathetic towards others.Additionally, the glorification of violence in films can distract youngsters from their studies, as they may become more interested in the thrilling and often unrealistic portrayals of violence rather than focusing on their academic pursuits. This can lead to a decline in their academic performance and a lack of interest in more positive and constructive activities. In conclusion, the growing violence in films has indeed affected youngsters in a negative way, influencing their behavior, emotions, and study habits. It is essential for filmmakers, parents, and society as a whole to be mindful of the content youngsters are exposed to and to promote more positive and uplifting role models in the media.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"The statement that in order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources is one that I strongly agree with. In today's world, where access to information is unparalleled, the importance of being well-informed cannot be overstated. Some people aptly say, ""information is power,"" underscoring the significance of staying abreast with current events, news, and developments. Being well-informed is crucial for making informed decisions, engaging in meaningful discussions, and contributing to societal debates.One of the primary reasons for consulting multiple news sources is to guarantee the reliability of the information. Relying on a single source can lead to a biased or incomplete understanding of issues. Different news sources often present unique perspectives, coverage, and analysis of the same event or problem. By cross-referencing information from various sources, individuals can verify facts, identify discrepancies, and form a more comprehensive view of the world.Knowing facts about events or problems, rather than just estimations, is very important. Estimations and opinions, while valuable, do not replace factual information. Facts provide a solid foundation for understanding and addressing issues. For instance, in the context of political decisions or health crises, having accurate, factual information is crucial for making informed choices and taking appropriate actions. Using different sources of information helps to distinguish between speculation and hard evidence, ensuring that decisions and opinions are grounded in reality.In conclusion, being well-informed is a cornerstone of active citizenship and personal empowerment. Given the diversity of news sources available, from traditional print and broadcast media to digital news platforms and social media, it is both feasible and necessary to consult multiple sources to ensure a well-rounded understanding of the world. By doing so, individuals not only enhance their knowledge but also contribute to a more informed and engaged society."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The preservation of old buildings is a contentious issue that sparks debate among individuals with differing opinions. On one hand, some people argue that old buildings are a hindrance to urban development, as the land they occupy could be utilized for more practical purposes, such as constructing modern housing and infrastructure to cater to the growing population. They contend that the value of land in cities is too high to be wasted on outdated structures that no longer serve a functional purpose.On the other hand, there are those who firmly believe that old buildings are an integral part of our cultural heritage and should be preserved at all costs. These individuals argue that these structures hold significant historical and sentimental value, providing a glimpse into the past and serving as a reminder of our cultural roots. The preservation of old buildings allows future generations to appreciate and learn from the accomplishments and traditions of their ancestors.In my opinion, the preservation of old buildings that contribute to our sense of culture and heritage is essential. The preservation of such buildings always poses a large question for governments, as it creates a conflict between the issues of providing housing for citizens and protecting our cultural legacy. However, I believe that the importance of preserving our cultural heritage outweighs the need for urban development. By conserving old buildings, we can maintain a connection to our past, promote cultural awareness, and provide a sense of continuity and identity. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the preservation of old buildings that hold cultural significance, as they are an irreplaceable part of our shared history and heritage.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way young people communicate, access information, and navigate their daily lives. Many young people consider mobile phones as the most important thing in their lives,, and it's not hard to see why. With a mobile phone, one can stay connected with friends and family,,assistantThe advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way young people communicate, access information, and navigate their daily lives. Many young people consider mobile phones as the most important thing in their lives, and it's not hard to see why. With a mobile phone, one can stay connected with friends and family, access a wealth of information, and capture memories with ease. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.Firstly, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. The constant notifications, social media updates, and text messages can be a significant distraction, leading to decreased attention span and poor academic performance. For instance, I have seen many of my friends constantly checking their phones during class, missing out on important lessons and instructions. This distraction can have long-term consequences, affecting their future career prospects and overall development.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. The constant exposure to advertisements, celebrity lifestyles, and consumerist culture can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of entitlement. Young people may start to prioritize material possessions and physical appearance over personal growth, relationships, and experiences. From my own experience, I have noticed that many young people are more concerned with showcasing their luxurious lifestyle on social media rather than engaging in meaningful activities or pursuing their passions.In conclusion, while mobile phones have many benefits, their popularity among young people is a bad development due to the distractions and materialistic tendencies they foster. It is essential for young people to maintain a balance between their mobile phone usage and other aspects of their lives, ensuring that they do not compromise their academic, personal, and social growth.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The debate over whether fixed punishments should be imposed for each type of crime has sparked intense discussion among scholars and policymakers. While some argue that fixed punishments provide clarity and efficiency, others believe that considering the circumstances and motivations behind a crime is essential for justice. On one hand, fixed punishments would undoubtedly reduce the time taken by judges to deliver their verdicts, thereby increasing the speed of the judicial process. This,ishment approach would also be economically effective for the government, as it would minimize the resources spent on lengthy court proceedings. Additionally, fixed punishments would provide a sense of consistency and fairness, as each crime would be met with a predetermined punishment, regardless of the perpetrator's background or motivations.On the other hand, having fixed punishments for each type of crime could potentially lead to an increase in crime rates, particularly among professional criminals. If the punishment for a specific crime is clear and well-known, professional criminals may be more likely to take the risk, as they would be fully aware of the consequences. This could embolden them to continue committing crimes, knowing exactly what to expect if caught. Furthermore, not taking into account the circumstances and motivations behind a crime could lead to unjust punishments, as each case is unique and deserves individual consideration.In conclusion, while fixed punishments may offer efficiency and consistency, they also pose significant drawbacks. It is crucial to consider the complexities of each case, including the motivations and circumstances, to ensure just and effective punishments. A balanced approach, taking into account both the need for efficiency and the importance of individualized justice, is likely the most effective way to address crime and promote a safer society.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has revolutionized the way people explore the world, granting ordinary individuals the freedom to travel further and experience diverse cultures. Specifically, cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group, who can now afford to travel for leisure or visit distant relatives. This increased accessibility has had a profound impact on societal connectivity, and has opened up new economic opportunities for many.However, on the other hand, the proliferation of cheap air travel has significant environmental drawbacks. More flights could mean bigger and busier airports, which may lead to a substantial increase in air pollution for people who live and work close to these hubs. The burning of plane fuel releases carbon dioxide into the environment, which is a major contributor to global warming, causing the Earth to heat up. This has severe implications for climate change, and the long-term effects on our planet's ecosystem are alarming.In my opinion, the benefits of cheap air travel do not outweigh the environmental costs. While it is essential to provide people with the freedom to travel, it is equally crucial to consider the planet's well-being. Governments and airlines should work together to implement sustainable practices, such as investing in cleaner fuels and reducing waste. Additionally, a balanced approach could be adopted, where air travel is made slightly more expensive to discourage excessive flying, while still keeping fares affordable for those who need to travel. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that the wonders of air travel are preserved for future generations, without compromising the health of our planet.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, people often find themselves torn between the charm of small towns and the hustle and bustle of big cities. Despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons. On the one hand, if I have always wanted to find a job, a place to live that is not too far from my workplace is a must. Big cities offer a wide range of job opportunities across various industries, making it more likely to find employment that matches my skills and interests.Furthermore, living in a big city allows me to enjoy modern life and have more access to advanced facilities. From state-of-the-art hospitals to world-class museums, big cities are equipped with amenities that enhance the quality of life. For instance, I can easily access a variety of restaurants, cinemas, and shopping malls, which provide endless entertainment options. Additionally, big cities typically have well-developed public transportation systems, making it convenient to get around without the need for a car.Living in big cities also means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. With a diverse population, I am surrounded by people from different backgrounds, cultures, and professions, which fosters a unique and dynamic environment. This exposure can broaden my perspectives, encourage creativity, and provide opportunities for personal growth. For example, attending lectures, seminars, and workshops in a big city can keep me updated on the latest trends and advancements in my field of interest. Overall, while small towns have their appeal, the benefits of living in a big city, including job opportunities, access to modern amenities, and exposure to diverse stimulation, make it my preferred choice.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are undoubtedly the most common ways to reward employees for good work. These traditional methods have been widely used by organizations to motivate their staff and encourage them to perform at their best. However, from my point of view, there are other rewards for good work that can be just as effective, if not more so, in encouraging further good work.Besides the traditional methods of salary increases and promotions, providing professional training can be a highly effective way to reward employees for their hard work. By offering training and development opportunities, employees can acquire new skills and enhance their existing ones, making them more competent and confident in their roles. This not only benefits the individual but also the organization as a whole, as a more skilled workforce can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. For instance, a company like Google offers its employees access to various training programs and workshops, allowing them to develop their skills and expertise, which in turn motivates them to continue delivering high-quality work.Additionally, other non-monetary rewards such as recognition, flexible working hours, and additional benefits like health insurance or gym memberships can also be effective in encouraging good work. For example, a company like Facebook offers its employees on-site childcare, free meals, and gym facilities, which creates a positive work environment and motivates employees to perform at their best. These rewards demonstrate that the organization values and appreciates its employees' hard work and is willing to invest in their well-being and growth. By adopting a more holistic approach to rewarding employees, organizations can create a motivated and engaged workforce that is driven to deliver exceptional results.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The debate on whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has sparked intense discussion. While some people believe that attending classes is essential, some argue that it should be optional. I strongly agree with the latter view, that attending classes in the university should be optional for students.In today's digital age, students have access to a plethora of learning resources outside the classroom. They can learn better from other sources such as online lectures, educational videos, and e-books. These alternative learning materials can provide a more engaging and personalized learning experience, allowing students to learn at their own pace. Moreover, online resources can often provide more up-to-date information than traditional classroom teaching, making them a valuable supplement to university education.Furthermore, students can also study by themselves in the library and focus on the topics they do not understand. This self-directed learning approach enables students to take ownership of their learning, identify areas where they need improvement, and work on them independently. The library provides a quiet and conducive environment, where students can concentrate on their studies without distractions. By allowing students to attend classes optionally, universities can promote autonomy, responsibility, and self-motivation among students.In conclusion, making attending classes optional for university students is a forward-thinking approach that acknowledges the diversity of learning styles and needs. By providing students with the flexibility to choose how they learn, universities can empower them to take charge of their education and make the most of the resources available to them. Ultimately, this approach can lead to more effective learning outcomes and better preparedness for the demands of the modern workforce.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;As I near the end of my university studies, I will soon be faced with a crucial decision: whether to reside in a small town or a big city. Both options have their unique charms, but for me, the allure of the big city is undeniable. In a few years, I will finish my studying and embark on my professional journey, and I firmly believe that a big city is where I want to be.Big city life provides many opportunities that align with my career aspirations and personal preferences. Firstly, it will be significantly easier for me to find an engineering job in the city, given the high concentration of industries and companies that require skilled professionals in my field. The job market in big cities is not only more extensive but also more competitive, pushing me to grow professionally.Secondly, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis, making it an ideal place for someone who values an active social life. The numerous bars, cafes, and restaurants offer endless options for socializing with friends, exploring different cuisines, and enjoying cultural events. This vibrant social scene is a big part of what attracts me to city living, as it promises a lifestyle that is engaging and dynamic.Lastly, cities have better medical facilities compared to those in the countryside, which is an important consideration for anyone looking to settle down. The access to advanced healthcare services provides peace of mind, knowing that quality medical care is readily available should it ever be needed.In conclusion, while small towns have their own set of advantages, such as a closer-knit community and a more relaxed pace of life, the benefits of living in a big city outweigh them for me. The combination of professional opportunities, rich social life, and superior amenities makes the big city the perfect place for me to start my post-university life.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The advent of the computer is one of the significant results of the development of advanced technology. In my point of view, computers have undoubtedly brought convenience and easiness to our life. This is primarily because they have enabled easier access to information and increased the quality of communication.With the internet at our fingertips, we can now access a vast array of information with just a few clicks. This has made research and learning much more efficient, allowing us to acquire knowledge and skills at an unprecedented pace. For instance, students can now access online libraries, libraries and educational resources, making it easier for them to complete their assignments and projects. Moreover, computers have also facilitated communication, enabling us to connect with people from all over the world instantly. Email, social media, and video conferencing tools have made it possible to stay in touch with friends and family, as well as conduct business meetings and collaborations remotely.Furthermore, computers have also automated many tasks, freeing up time for more creative and intellectual pursuits. For example, online banking and shopping have reduced the need for physical trips to the bank or store, allowing us to manage our finances and purchase goods with greater ease. In addition, computers have also enabled us to work remotely, providing greater flexibility and work-life balance.In conclusion, while some people may argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful, I firmly believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. By providing easier access to information, increasing the quality of communication, and automating tasks, computers have undoubtedly made life easier and more convenient. As technology continues to advance, I am excited to see the new ways in which computers will improve our lives and make the world a more connected and efficient place.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The advent of computers and modems has revolutionized the way office workers operate, enabling them to perform their tasks from the comfort of their own homes. This phenomenon has sparked a debate about whether working from home should be encouraged. While some people argue that working at home brings too much convenience, I disagree. In my opinion, working from home is beneficial, but it is not without its drawbacks.Some people think that working at home brings too much convenience, but I don't. They believe that the absence of a structured office environment and the lack of supervision can lead to procrastination and decreased productivity. However, I think that this convenience can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows workers to have more flexibility and autonomy, which can boost their motivation and job satisfaction. On the other hand, it can also lead to distractions and isolation, which can negatively impact their performance.Moreover, the best conditions for working from home are sometimes not as ideal as people expect. For instance, working without pressure and interaction can be detrimental to one's work quality and overall well-being. Human interaction and collaboration are essential components of a healthy work environment, and their absence can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Additionally, working without pressure can result in a lack of accountability and motivation, which can hinder one's professional growth and development.In conclusion, while working from home has its advantages, it is not without its disadvantages. The lack of pressure and interaction can be significant drawbacks, and the convenience it offers can be a double-edged sword. Nevertheless, with the right mindset and self-discipline, working from home can be a highly productive and satisfying experience. Therefore, I believe that working from home should be encouraged, but with caution and careful consideration of its potential pitfalls.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that their primary focus should be on research, while others believe that their main responsibility is to educate students. In my opinion, I firmly believe that professors should prioritize preparing courses for students over conducting research. If professors are preoccupied with research and neglect to prepare suitable courses for their students, it would ultimately tarnish the reputation of universities. Universities are institutions where students go to learn and gain knowledge, and it is the professors' responsibility to provide them with a well-structured and engaging educational experience. When professors focus more on research, they may not have the time or energy to devote to creating comprehensive and effective lesson plans, which can lead to a decline in the quality of education provided.However, this does not mean that research and education are mutually exclusive. In fact, professors can effectively teach students through research and projects, allowing them to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. By involving students in their research, professors can create a unique learning experience that not only enhances students' understanding of the subject matter but also fosters critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. This approach enables professors to balance their research responsibilities with their educational duties, ultimately benefiting both the students and the university as a whole. In conclusion, while research is an essential aspect of a professor's role, I believe that preparing courses for students should be their priority. By doing so, professors can ensure that students receive a high-quality education, and universities can maintain their reputation and academic excellence.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The past century has witnessed tremendous technological progress, which has had a profound impact on various aspects of our lives. While I acknowledge the remarkable contributions of technological advancements, I also agree that they have negative effects, despite their benefits.On the one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. The advent of automation, artificial intelligence, and the internet has created new industries, jobs, and opportunities, leading to increased economic activity and higher standards of living. Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. For instance, medical advancements have led to the discovery of new treatments and cures for diseases, while telecommunications have made it possible for people to access information and services from anywhere in the world.On the other hand, technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. The increased use of technology has led to a rise in pollution, e-waste, and energy consumption, which have severe environmental consequences. Moreover, the over-reliance on technology has also led to social issues such as isolation, decreased attention span, and decreased face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, the unequal access to technology has also created a digital divide, where some individuals are left behind, exacerbating social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, while technological progress has undoubtedly improved our lives, it is crucial to acknowledge its negative effects on the environment and society. It is essential to strike a balance between harnessing the benefits of technology and mitigating its adverse consequences. By doing so, we can ensure that technological advancements continue to enhance our lives while minimizing their harmful impacts.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The statement ""Prevention is better than cure"" has become a guiding principle in the realm of healthcare. In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. This implies that a significant portion of a country's health budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures, rather than solely focusing on treatment. I strongly agree with this assertion, as it is more cost-effective and beneficial in the long run to prevent illnesses than to treat them.Diverting a large proportion of the health budget towards health education and preventative measures can have numerous benefits. For instance, educational campaigns can raise awareness about the risks associated with certain lifestyle choices, such as smoking and poor diet, and encourage individuals to adopt healthier habits. Moreover, preventative measures like vaccinations and regular check-ups can help identify and manage health issues before they escalate into more severe problems. By investing in these areas, governments can reduce the burden on healthcare systems and alleviate the financial strain of treating chronic diseases.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. This approach not only saves lives but also reduces healthcare costs in the long term. By prioritizing prevention and education, governments can create a healthier and more sustainable society, where citizens are empowered to take control of their well-being and make informed decisions about their health. Ultimately, this strategy is essential for building a robust and efficient healthcare system that benefits the nation as a whole."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;The decision of where to live while attending university is a significant one, as it can greatly impact a student's overall experience. Many students prefer to live in university dormitories, while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages, making the choice a difficult one.On the one hand, living in university dormitories offers a sense of community and convenience. Dorms are often located on or near campus, making it easy to attend classes and participate in university events. Additionally, dorms provide a built-in social network, allowing students to easily make friends and connect with peers. However, dorms can also be noisy and lacking in privacy, which may hinder studying and relaxation.On the other hand, living in an apartment in the city offers a greater level of freedom and independence. Students can come and go as they please, without the restrictions of dormitory rules and regulations. Apartments also provide more space and privacy, allowing students to focus on their studies and pursue their own interests. Furthermore, living in the city can provide a more immersive and diverse experience, with access to a wide range of cultural, entertainment, and employment opportunities.After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions, and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer living in an apartment. While dorms offer a sense of community, I value the independence and flexibility that comes with living in an apartment. I believe that having my own space would allow me to focus better on my studies and pursue my own interests, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling university experience. Additionally, living in the city would provide me with a wider range of opportunities and experiences, which I believe are essential for personal growth and development.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"When it comes to choosing between serious and entertaining movies, I have to say that I prefer a mix of both. On one hand, serious movies are designed to make the audience think and often tackle complex issues such as love, humaneness, and social problems. These movies usually encourage viewers to reflect on their own values and morals, and may even inspire them to make positive changes in their lives. For instance, serious movies may point out the dark sides of society, such as poverty, inequality, and injustice, prompting viewers to think critically about these issues.On the other hand, entertaining movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. One example of a movie that successfully balances entertainment with a serious message is ""Click"". This comedy film takes a humorous approach to highlighting the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The main character's journey serves as a reminder to prioritize what truly matters in life, making it a very interesting and thought-provoking watch. I prefer this type of movie because it manages to convey a meaningful message without being too preachy or boring.Overall, while I appreciate the thought-provoking nature of serious movies, I believe that entertaining movies with a serious approach, like ""Click"", are more effective in conveying important messages to a wider audience. By presenting serious issues in an engaging and humorous way, these movies can inspire viewers to think critically and make positive changes in their lives, all while being thoroughly entertained."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;I strongly agree with the statement that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people, such as public figures and celebrities. In my point of view, the disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The media often sensationalize and distort the personal lives of celebrities, creating a false narrative that can be damaging to their reputation and mental health. This not only invades their privacy but also sets a bad example for the younger generation, who may idolize these celebrities and try to emulate their behavior.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems that require attention and discussion. Instead of focusing on pressing issues like poverty, inequality, and climate change, the media prioritizes celebrity scandals and gossip. This can lead to a lack of awareness and engagement on critical issues that affect the community, ultimately hindering progress and positive change.The media has a significant influence on shaping public opinion and agenda, and it is their responsibility to use this power wisely. By overemphasizing on the personal lives of famous people, the media is not only doing a disservice to the celebrities themselves but also to the public, who are being denied the opportunity to engage with meaningful and impactful stories. Therefore, I firmly believe that the media should strike a balance between reporting on celebrity news and focusing on more substantial and socially relevant issues.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;As a lover of travel, I firmly believe that visiting museums is an essential part of exploring a new destination. For many travelers, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum would be the best part of a tour. There are several reasons why people visit museums when they travel to new places. Primary among these reasons is the ease with which one can learn about the history and customs of the new place. Museums offer a concise and comprehensive overview of a region's past, making it easier for visitors to understand the context and significance of the landmarks and cultural practices they encounter.Secondary to this, visiting a well-known museum can also broaden our horizon by exposing us to different perspectives, ideas, and artistic expressions. For instance, a visit to the Louvre in Paris or the Met in New York can be a transformative experience, introducing viewers to some of the most iconic works of art in human history. Such encounters not only deepen our understanding of the local culture but also encourage us to think critically about our own cultural assumptions and biases. Furthermore, museums often host temporary exhibitions that showcase contemporary issues and innovations, providing visitors with insights into the latest scientific, technological, and social developments.In conclusion, visiting museums is a vital component of traveling, as it allows us to engage with the local history, customs, and ideas. Whether it is to gain a deeper understanding of a place's past or to expand our knowledge of the world, museums have something to offer every kind of traveler. As a traveler, I can attest that the experience of visiting an excellent museum is indeed a highlight of any tour, leaving a lasting impression and a newfound appreciation for the richness and diversity of human culture.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The advent of technology has led to a significant shift in the way we approach education. In the future, students may have the option to study at home using technology such as computers or televisions, or they can opt for traditional schooling. While studying at home using technology may seem convenient, as it allows students to learn at their own pace and comfort, I believe that traditional schooling is still the better option.Studying at home by using technology may be convenient, but it may also be difficult to complete a course at home without the guidance and support of teachers and peers. Distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates who can provide immediate feedback and help. Moreover, the lack of human interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from the learning community.On the other hand, traditional schooling offers an advantage that technology cannot replicate - socialization. Being in a classroom with fellow students allows us to establish relationships, learn how to work in teams, and develop essential communication skills. Computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people, resolve conflicts, or build meaningful friendships. These social skills are crucial for success in all areas of life, and traditional schooling provides the perfect environment to develop them.In conclusion, while technology has made significant strides in education, I believe that traditional schooling is still the preferred option. The benefits of socialization, human interaction, and immediate feedback outweigh the convenience of studying at home using technology. Traditional schooling provides a well-rounded education that goes beyond academic knowledge, teaching us essential life skills that are necessary for success.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The recent announcement of a large shopping center being built in our neighborhood has sparked a heated debate among residents. As for me, I strongly support this plan. The establishment of a large shopping center will undoubtedly provide us with a more convenient place to go shopping. No longer will we have to travel to distant areas to find a wide range of products, which will not only save us time but also reduce the hassle of commuting.Moreover, the shopping center is likely to offer goods at lower prices, which will be a significant advantage for us residents. With multiple stores and shops under one roof, there will be increased competition among sellers, which will drive prices down. This will enable us to purchase our daily necessities and other goods at affordable prices, making our lives easier and more economical. Additionally, the shopping center will provide a one-stop solution for all our shopping needs, saving us time and effort that would otherwise be spent traveling to different stores.On the other hand, the shopping center will also create new job opportunities for the local community, which will contribute to the overall economic growth of our neighborhood. Furthermore, the increased foot traffic will also boost the sales of local businesses, such as restaurants and cafes, which will benefit from the increased customer base. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the construction of a large shopping center in our neighborhood will have numerous benefits, including convenience, affordability, and time-saving. I wholeheartedly support this plan and look forward to enjoying the advantages it will bring to our community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";In today's fast-paced and frenetic world, a very important skill a person should learn to be successful is stress management. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. However, if not managed properly, it can lead to depression and anxiety, which are common predicaments that people of all ages face. With the constant pressure to perform and achieve, it is essential to learn how to cope with stress to maintain mental and physical well-being.Effective stress management enables individuals to handle pressure and adversity, leading to increased productivity, better relationships, and a stronger sense of self-control. For instance, a person who can manage stress is more likely to approach challenges with a clear mind, leading to creative problem-solving and innovation. Moreover, good stress management skills help individuals to prioritize tasks, set realistic goals, and maintain a healthy work-life balance, ultimately leading to greater success and happiness.Furthermore, in a world where depression and anxiety are on the rise, learning stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and exercise can be a lifesaver. By incorporating these techniques into daily life, individuals can reduce their stress levels, leading to improved mental health and a reduced risk of depression. In conclusion, learning stress management skills is crucial for success in today's world. By prioritizing mental well-being and learning to cope with pressure, individuals can achieve their goals, maintain strong relationships, and live a happy and healthy life. As such, it is essential that people of all ages learn and practice stress management techniques to navigate the challenges of modern life.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Groups or organizations play a vital role in the lives of many individuals, and their importance cannot be overstated. These collectives provide a platform for people to gain valuable experiences, achieve personal and professional goals, and foster socialization from a young age. For instance, groups and organizations offer a conducive environment where individuals can develop new skills, pursue their passions, and work collaboratively towards a common objective. This not only enhances their skill set but also boosts their confidence and self-esteem.Moreover, groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. They provide a space for people to interact with like-minded individuals, form meaningful relationships, and develop a sense of belonging. For example, schools and universities are groups that facilitate socialization among students, while professional organizations and networking groups serve the same purpose for working adults. These interactions are crucial in shaping an individual's personality, values, and worldview.A solid group can be a suited environment that provides people with the opportunity to improve themselves and broaden their horizons. By surrounding themselves with motivated and like-minded individuals, people can challenge themselves, set ambitious goals, and strive for excellence. Furthermore, groups often provide access to resources, mentorship, and guidance, which can be instrumental in helping individuals overcome obstacles and achieve their objectives. Overall, groups and organizations are essential for personal and professional growth, socialization, and self-improvement, making them an integral part of many people's lives. By participating in these collectives, individuals can unlock their full potential, develop meaningful relationships, and lead more fulfilling lives.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The government's plan to build a new university in our community has sparked a heated debate among residents. On one hand, there are numerous advantages to establishing a university in our area. One of the most significant benefits is that it would provide more opportunities for people in the community to pursue higher education. This would not only enhance their career prospects but also contribute to the overall development of the community. The university would also attract highly qualified professors and researchers, which would lead to an exchange of ideas and knowledge, thereby enriching the community's intellectual landscape.Furthermore, the presence of a university would likely boost the local economy, as students and faculty would require accommodation, food, and other services, creating new job opportunities and stimulating economic growth. Additionally, the university could also serve as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship, providing resources and support for startups and small businesses. For instance, the university could offer courses and workshops on entrepreneurship, and provide access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, enabling students and local entrepreneurs to develop and launch their own businesses.However, there are also some disadvantages to consider. One of the main concerns is that the university could lead to social problems, such as increased noise, traffic, and strain on local resources. The influx of students could also lead to a rise in housing costs, making it difficult for long-time residents to afford living in the area. Moreover, the university's infrastructure and facilities might put a strain on the community's existing resources, such as water and energy supply. For example, the university's energy consumption could lead to an increase in the community's carbon footprint, which could have negative environmental impacts.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of establishing a university in our community, the benefits of increased access to education, economic growth, and innovation make it an attractive proposition. With careful planning and management, the government and community leaders can work together to mitigate the negative impacts and ensure that the university becomes a valuable and integrated part of our community.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The debate about who should bear the cost of college education has sparked intense discussion among individuals. While some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to attend, I firmly disagree with this notion. In my opinion, individuals should pay their own college tuition, as it would be excessively costly for the government to undertake this responsibility.One of the primary concerns is that providing free college education would lead to a significant increase in taxes. The government would need to allocate a substantial amount of funds to cover the tuition fees and expenses of all citizens who wish to attend college. This would result in a repetitive hike in taxes, which would ultimately burden the taxpayers. I believe that it is unfair to expect taxpayers to bear the cost of individual choices, especially when it comes to something as personal as education.Furthermore, I believe that college education is a personal choice. Individuals who wish to pursue higher education should take responsibility for financing their own education. This not only fosters a sense of personal responsibility but also allows individuals to make informed decisions about their own educational pursuits. By paying for their own education, individuals are more likely to appreciate the value of their education and make the most out of the opportunities available to them.In conclusion, while the idea of free college education may seem appealing, I firmly believe that individuals should pay their own college tuition. The cost of providing free education would be too high, and it would be unfair to expect taxpayers to foot the bill. Ultimately, college education is a personal choice, and individuals should take responsibility for financing their own educational pursuits.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";"The statement that ""television has destroyed communication among friends and family"" is a topic of debate. While some argue that television has hindered face-to-face interaction, I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, television provides us with many benefits that outweigh its potential drawbacks. For instance, it helps people relax after a long day, keeps us up-to-date with current news and events, and broadens our minds by exposing us to different cultures and perspectives.However, it is undeniable that excessive television watching can have negative effects on communication among friends and family. Children, in particular, are vulnerable to learning behaviors from what they see on TV, rather than from their parents or caregivers. This can lead to a decline in meaningful interactions and a lack of social skills. For example, a child who spends most of their time watching TV may learn aggressive behavior from violent TV shows, rather than learning empathy and kindness from their parents.Despite this, I believe that television can also bring people together. Many families watch TV shows or movies together, using this as an opportunity to bond and discuss what they are watching. Additionally, TV can provide common topics of conversation, helping to facilitate communication among friends and family. In conclusion, while television may have some negative effects on communication, I do not agree that it has destroyed communication among friends and family. When used in moderation, television can be a valuable tool for relaxation, education, and socialization."
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";I strongly agree with the statement that attending a live performance is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. As a huge football fan, I can attest that attending a live match of my home team is an exhilarating experience that surpasses watching it on TV. There's something special about being part of a massive crowd, cheering and chanting alongside fellow fans, that creates an electric atmosphere. Staying at home and watching the match alone simply cannot replicate this excitement.First and foremost, attending a live football match is a truly fulfilling experience. Being able to watch football stars play the game with my own eyes, surrounded by approximately 40,000 people who share my passion, is an unparalleled thrill. The collective energy of the crowd, the roar of the stadium, and the sense of community all combine to create an unforgettable experience. While the tickets to get into the stadium may be a bit pricey, I firmly believe that the entertainment value I gain from the game far outweighs the cost.Moreover, the live atmosphere allows for a deeper connection with the game and the team. I can feel the tension, the suspense, and the euphoria of scoring a goal, all of which are muted when watching on TV. The sense of camaraderie and shared experience with fellow fans is also lost when watching alone at home. In conclusion, attending a live football match is an experience like no other, offering a unique and captivating experience that cannot be replicated by watching on television. The thrill of being part of a live crowd, the excitement of watching football stars in action, and the sense of community all make attending a live performance a far more enjoyable experience than watching it on TV.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The shift towards renewable resources of energy, including sun, wind, and water, has been a significant aspect of the current and future energy strategy. These new forms of energy are being hailed as the potential replacements for fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. However, as far as I'm concerned, I disagree that renewable resources of energy will soon replace fossil fuels.The main reason for this disagreement is the limitation of technology. Despite the advancements made in the field of renewable energy, the technology is still not advanced enough to make it a viable replacement for fossil fuels. Additionally, renewable resources are relatively expensive compared to fossil fuels, which makes them less attractive to consumers and industries. The cost of investment in renewable energy infrastructure, such as solar panels and wind turbines, is still high, making it a significant barrier to widespread adoption.Furthermore, the intermittency of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, makes them unreliable as a primary source of energy. The storage technology for renewable energy is still in its infancy, making it difficult to store excess energy generated during peak production periods. Until these technological limitations are addressed, I believe that fossil fuels will continue to be the primary source of energy.In conclusion, while renewable resources of energy are an essential part of our current and future energy strategy, I do not think they will soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. The limitations of technology and the relatively high cost of renewable energy make it challenging to adopt them as a primary source of energy. However, continued investment in research and development may eventually make renewable energy a viable alternative to fossil fuels.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;The notion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry take precedence over saving land for endangered animals is a prevailing opinion. The reasoning behind this viewpoint is multifaceted. Firstly, land utilized for agriculture, real estate, and industry can benefit the whole society to a greater extent. For instance, the production of food, the construction of homes, and the manufacturing of goods are all crucial to sustaining and improving human lives. These sectors are fundamental to the economy, providing essential goods and services that directly impact the quality of life for a large number of people.Secondly, the expansion of farmlands and industries can significantly contribute to job creation, which in turn can lead to a decrease in the unemployment rate and, by extension, the crime rate. When people are employed, they are more likely to contribute positively to society, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This ripple effect underscores the importance of prioritizing human needs over the conservation of land for endangered species. Proponents of this view argue that the immediate needs of humans, such as food, shelter, and employment, cannot be compromised for the sake of conservation, especially in areas where human development is scarce or underdeveloped.However, it's also important to consider the long-term consequences of prioritizing human needs over conservation. The loss of biodiversity and ecosystems can have irreversible effects on the planet, potentially threatening human survival and well-being in the long run. Nonetheless, from a utilitarian perspective, the needs of the many often outweigh the needs of the few, or in this case, the endangered species. Therefore, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals is understandable, given the immediate and tangible benefits these sectors provide to society.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The debate about the most effective way to learn a foreign language has sparked intense discussion among language learners and educators. Some people argue that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning it in a country with another language. I agree with this statement, as I believe that immersion in the language and culture of the country provides a unique learning experience.People who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills, such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing, than those who learn the same language in their own countries. This is because they are constantly exposed to the language in their daily lives, allowing them to pick up nuances and expressions that may not be taught in a classroom. Moreover, they have the opportunity to interact with native speakers, which enhances their pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.On the other hand, person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method, where the language is broken down into manageable parts and taught in a structured manner. However, this method lacks the authenticity and spontaneity of learning a language in its original country. The learner may struggle to apply their language skills in real-life situations, as they are not exposed to the same level of language immersion.In conclusion, learning a foreign language in its original country provides a more comprehensive and immersive learning experience. The benefits of cultural immersion, authentic language practice, and nuanced understanding of language skills make it a more effective way to learn a foreign language. While step-by-step teaching methods have their advantages, they cannot replace the richness and depth of language learning that comes from being surrounded by the language and culture.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The debate about whether physical exercise should be a mandatory part of every school day or not has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that students should focus solely on academic studies, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be a required component of each school day. Exercise is not only beneficial for maintaining a healthy body, but it also has a profound impact on mental well-being. Regular physical activity has been proven to improve cognitive function, boost mood, and reduce stress levels.Moreover, daily exercise plays a crucial role in developing children's brain function. Research has shown that physical activity enhances blood flow to the brain, thereby improving concentration, memory, and overall academic performance. By incorporating exercise into their daily routine, students can experience these benefits firsthand, leading to better academic outcomes. Additionally, introducing children to a daily exercise routine from an early age will instill in them the importance of physical activity as a vital part of their daily lives. This habit will likely stay with them throughout their lives, promoting a lifelong commitment to health and wellness.Incorporating physical exercise into the school day can take many forms, such as sports classes, dance sessions, or simply outdoor playtime. By making exercise a non-negotiable part of the school day, schools can help shape the next generation into active, healthy, and mentally agile individuals. In conclusion, I strongly agree that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day, as it offers a wide range of benefits that extend far beyond the physical realm, positively impacting both body and mind.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In some countries, it is common for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students. However, in my opinion, it is not a good idea for teenagers to have a job while they are still students. Having a job at a young age can interfere with their life in various ways, ultimately affecting their overall well-being and academic performance.One of the primary concerns is that working can affect the health of the student. Teenagers who work long hours may not get enough sleep, exercise, or eat a balanced diet, which can lead to physical and mental health problems. Moreover, the added stress of managing work and school responsibilities can be overwhelming, leading to anxiety and depression. This can have long-term consequences on their physical and mental health, hindering their ability to reach their full potential.Furthermore, having a job can divert their mind from studies, making it challenging to focus on academic goals. Teenagers with jobs may have to miss classes, assignments, and study sessions, ultimately affecting their grades and academic performance. This can limit their future opportunities, as a good education is essential for career advancement and personal growth.Lastly, having a job at a young age can take away their childhood phase from their life. Teenage years are a critical period for socialization, exploration, and personal development. Working can deprive them of the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, sports, and social events, which are essential for building relationships, skills, and character. By not having a job, teenagers can enjoy their childhood, focus on their studies, and develop into well-rounded individuals. In conclusion, while having a job can provide teenagers with valuable work experience and financial independence, the potential risks and drawbacks outweigh the benefits, making it not a good idea for teenagers to have a job while they are still students.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The debate about the usefulness of zoos has been ongoing for a long time. On one hand, zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment and education. Many people visit zoos to learn about different species of animals and to appreciate their beauty. Zoos provide a platform for people to gain knowledge about wildlife and the importance of conservation. Additionally, zoos offer entertainment for people of all ages,. They provide a unique opportunity for people to see animals up close and personal, which can be both exciting and educational.On the other hand, there are also people who think that zoos are cruel and wrong to keep animals in such prisons. These people argue that animals are meant to be free and roam in their natural habitats, not be confined to small enclosures for human entertainment. They believe that keeping animals in zoos is a form of exploitation and can cause stress and harm to the animals. I agree with this point of view. While zoos may provide some benefits, such as education and conservation, the harm caused to the animals outweighs these benefits. Animals are not meant to be kept in captivity for human entertainment, and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve their natural habitats. In conclusion, while zoos may have been established for ages, I believe that it is cruel and wrong to confine animals in zoos, and we should focus on preserving their natural habitats and promoting conservation efforts.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When it comes to studying, there are two common approaches: studying alone or studying with a group of students. While some students prefer to study alone, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities that come with this activity. Studying with a group provides me with a supportive and collaborative learning environment that enhances my overall academic experience.One of the primary reasons I prefer group study is the opportunity to receive help from my peers. When I am struggling with a particular concept or topic, my friends can offer explanations and insights that help clarify my understanding. Additionally, studying with a group allows us to share knowledge and resources, which can be incredibly beneficial, especially when preparing for exams or working on complex projects. For instance, if one of my friends has a stronger grasp of a particular subject, they can provide valuable guidance and support, helping me to better comprehend the material.Moreover, studying in a group setting also enables me to improve my learning skills. Through discussions and debates with my peers, I can develop my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By engaging with others, I am exposed to different perspectives and ideas, which can broaden my understanding of the subject matter and encourage me to think more critically. For example, in a group study session, we can work together to solve a difficult problem, with each of us contributing our thoughts and ideas. This collaborative approach not only helps me to learn more effectively but also fosters teamwork, communication, and time management skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that studying in a group of friends offers numerous benefits, including the opportunity to receive help from peers and improve my learning skills. Through collaborative learning, I can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, develop important life skills, and enjoy a more engaging and supportive learning experience. Overall, studying with a group of friends is an approach that I find highly effective and enjoyable, and one that I will continue to utilize throughout my academic journey.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Despite the fact that friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences when it comes to spending time with friends. Some individuals prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Both approaches have their advantages, but in my view, I prefer the second attitude.On the one hand, spending time with a small circle of close friends allows for deeper and more meaningful relationships. This approach enables individuals to share personal thoughts and feelings with trusted friends, creating a sense of intimacy and loyalty. However, this approach may limit one's exposure to new experiences and perspectives.On the other hand, spending time with a large number of friends offers a wider range of benefits. In my view, I prefer this approach because staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from others' experiences. By interacting with diverse groups of people, one can gain new insights, discover different cultures, and develop a broader understanding of the world. Moreover, this approach can also lead to a stronger sense of belonging and a larger support network, which can be incredibly valuable in times of need.In conclusion, while both approaches have their advantages, I believe that spending time with a large number of friends is the more rewarding experience. Not only does it provide the opportunity to learn from others, but it also fosters personal growth, social skills, and a wider perspective on life. Ultimately, having a large and diverse group of friends can greatly enrich one's life and provide a sense of fulfillment that is hard to find elsewhere.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The debate about whether government should spend more money on improving roads and highways or on improving public transportation has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, the government should prioritize spending on public transportation, such as buses, trains, and subways. One of the primary reasons for this is the conservation of natural resources. The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve these resources, which are gradually running out. By using public transportation, people can reduce their reliance on private cars, which guzzle large amounts of oil and gasoline.In contrast, public transportation options like buses, trains, and subways can carry far more people while using significantly less fuel per person. This not only helps to conserve natural resources but also reduces pollution. The more cars that are driven, the more pollution is released into the air, contributing to global warming and harming the environment. By investing in public transportation, the government can help to mitigate this problem and create a more sustainable future.Moreover, using public transportation has social benefits. It allows people to interact with each other, fostering a sense of community and sociability. In contrast, driving a private car can be a solitary and isolating experience. By promoting the use of public transportation, the government can help to build stronger, more connected communities. In conclusion, the government should prioritize spending on public transportation to conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and promote sociability. This investment will have long-term benefits for the environment, the economy, and society as a whole.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate about whether animals should be kept in zoos has sparked intense discussion among animal lovers and conservationists. While many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals, as they provide a safe and controlled environment for them to thrive, others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. However, in my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment, rather than confining them to enclosures for human entertainment.Keeping animals in zoos can be detrimental to their well-being, as it can cause them undue stress and disrupt their natural behavior. For instance, many animals in zoos exhibit abnormal behaviors such as pacing, self-mutilation, and aggression, which are clear indicators of their distress. Furthermore, zoos often fail to provide animals with the space and stimulation they need to thrive, leading to a poor quality of life. On the other hand, allowing animals to live in their natural habitats ensures that they can roam freely, hunt, and interact with their own kind, thereby promoting their physical and mental health.Moreover, conservation efforts should focus on protecting and preserving natural habitats, rather than relying on zoos as a means of conservation. By preserving and restoring natural ecosystems, we can ensure the long-term survival of species, rather than relying on artificial environments. In conclusion, while zoos may have some benefits, I firmly believe that animals should be free to live in their own environment, where they can thrive and live safely and comfortably. It is our responsibility to protect and conserve their natural habitats, rather than keeping them in captivity for our own entertainment.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;If a university plans to develop a new research center in my country, I would strongly recommend establishing a center for research in agriculture over a center for business research. This decision is driven by the potential of agricultural research to directly benefit the local population and contribute significantly to the country's economic development.Firstly, a center for research in agriculture can empower my fellow citizens to better exploit the land. By developing innovative farming techniques, improving crop yields, and enhancing the quality of agricultural products, the center can help increase food security and provide farmers with the tools they need to compete in both local and international markets. This not only enhances the livelihoods of those directly involved in farming but also contributes to the overall food supply, benefiting the entire population.Secondly, such a center can play a crucial role in improving the economy of my country. Notably, the agriculture field currently accounts for only thirty percent of the market share, indicating a vast potential for growth. By investing in agricultural research, the university can help unlock this potential, leading to increased productivity, job creation, and economic expansion. Moreover, a thriving agricultural sector can contribute to a more balanced economy, reducing dependence on other sectors and fostering sustainable development.In conclusion, given the potential to enhance land use, improve food security, and boost the national economy, a center for research in agriculture is the more beneficial choice for my country. It aligns with national interests, supports local communities, and has the potential to drive meaningful economic growth, making it a recommendation that I firmly stand behind.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;People learn in different ways, and with so many things to discover in life, it's essential to find the most effective method that suits each individual. Throughout our lives, we are presented with numerous opportunities to broaden our knowledge and skills, and we often utilize several ways to achieve this. Among the various methods of learning, I strongly prefer learning by doing things myself, rather than relying on reading about them or listening to others talk about them.Learning by doing things has been the most impactful for me, as it not only helps me understand concepts better but also develops my maturity. When I engage in hands-on experiences, I am forced to think critically and make decisions independently. This approach has taught me to depend on myself, rather than relying on others for guidance. For instance, when I was learning to cook, I didn't just read recipes or watch cooking videos. Instead, I started preparing meals on my own, making mistakes, and learning from them. This practical experience not only improved my cooking skills but also boosted my confidence in taking on new challenges.By doing things myself, I have learned to take responsibility for my actions, to problem-solve, and to adapt to new situations. These skills are invaluable and have benefited me in many areas of my life, from academics to personal projects. Furthermore, learning by doing encourages experimentation, creativity, and innovation, which are essential for personal and professional growth. In conclusion, while reading and listening are valuable learning tools, I firmly believe that doing things myself is the best method for me, as it fosters independence, maturity, and a deeper understanding of the world around me.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap air travel has sparked a heated debate about its impact on society and the environment. On one hand, many people believe that affordable air fares should be encouraged as they have broadened travel possibilities for many individuals, particularly those from lower income groups. This has given ordinary people the freedom to travel further, exploring new destinations and experiencing different cultures. Cheap air fares have made it possible for people to visit their loved ones who live abroad, or to take a dream vacation that was previously unaffordable.On the other hand, there are those who argue that the growth of cheap flights has a negative impact on the environment. The burning of plane fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming, causing the Earth to heat up. This has severe consequences, including rising sea levels, more frequent natural disasters, and unpredictable weather patterns. To mitigate these effects, some advocate for making air travel more expensive to discourage people from flying, thereby reducing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry.In my opinion, while the environmental concerns are valid, I believe that cheap air travel should still be encouraged, but with a caveat. Airlines and governments should invest in sustainable aviation practices, such as using biofuels, improving fuel efficiency, and implementing carbon offsetting schemes. This way, the benefits of affordable air travel can be balanced with the need to protect the environment. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both the social and environmental implications of cheap air travel is necessary to ensure that the freedom to travel is preserved for future generations.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The debate on whether governments should allocate more funds to improve roads and highways or enhance public transportation has been ongoing. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system. This is because the rising number of private cars is creating numerous problems that can be mitigated through the use of public transportation.Firstly, using public transportation reduces the amount of resources used on transportation. When people opt for buses, trains, or subways, they significantly decrease the demand for private cars, which in turn, leads to a reduction in fuel consumption and the subsequent strain on natural resources. This is a crucial step towards sustainable development and conservation of energy.Secondly, public transportation helps to solve air pollution problems. The excessive number of private cars on the road contributes to a significant increase in air pollution, which has severe consequences on the environment and public health. By encouraging the use of public transportation, governments can reduce the number of vehicles emitting harmful pollutants, thereby improving air quality.Moreover, public transportation is a safer mode of travel. According to the National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than driving a private car. This is a compelling reason for governments to invest in public transportation, as it would lead to a reduction in accidents and fatalities on the road.In conclusion, governments should prioritize spending on public transportation over improving roads and highways. By doing so, they can effectively address the problems created by the rising number of private cars, including resource depletion, air pollution, and road accidents. Investing in public transportation is a step towards creating a more sustainable, safer, and environmentally friendly transportation system.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;When it comes to studying, students have different preferences. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups, as it allows them to discuss and understand complex topics better. Group study sessions can be engaging and interactive, helping students to stay motivated and retain information more effectively. However, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more on the subject matter.Studying alone enables me to focus on my weaknesses and work on improving them at my own pace. Without any distractions, I can delve deeper into the topics that I struggle with, thereby gaining a better understanding. Moreover, studying individually allows me to develop important life skills. We are building our personalities when we study alone, as it fosters independence, self-discipline, and responsibility. For example, answering homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent, as we have to rely solely on ourselves to complete tasks and meet deadlines.This sense of accountability is essential for personal growth and development. When I study alone, I am more likely to take ownership of my learning, making mistakes and learning from them without relying on others. This, in turn, helps me to become a more confident and self-assured individual. In conclusion, while group study sessions have their benefits, I firmly believe that studying individually is more effective for me. It allows me to concentrate, build my personality, and develop essential life skills that will benefit me in the long run. By studying alone, I can take control of my learning, making it a more meaningful and productive experience.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The debate about whether human activity is beneficial or detrimental to the Earth has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, human activity is causing irreparable harm to the planet. The overwhelming evidence suggests that our actions are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resources, and threatening the livelihood of other species.One of the most significant issues is pollution. Human activities such as industrial production, vehicle emissions, and waste disposal are releasing massive amounts of toxic substances into the air, water, and soil. This not only harms the environment but also has severe consequences for human health. Furthermore, the depletion of natural resources such as oil, coal, and gas is occurring at an alarming rate. The extraction and consumption of these resources are not only finite but also contribute to pollution and climate change.In addition to environmental degradation, human activity is also endangering the lives of other species. Deforestation,, as a result of human expansion and development, has led to the loss of habitats and extinction of countless species. The destruction of ecosystems has a ripple effect, impacting the delicate balance of nature and ultimately threatening the survival of many plants and animals. For instance, the reduction of biodiversity due to human activities has severe implications for the health of our planet and its ability to sustain life.In conclusion, the evidence clearly indicates that human activity is damaging the Earth. The pollution of the environment, exhaustion of natural resources, and threat to other species are all pressing concerns that need to be addressed. It is imperative that we take collective action to mitigate these effects and work towards a more sustainable future. By adopting environmentally friendly practices, conserving natural resources, and protecting biodiversity, we can reduce the harm caused by human activity and preserve the Earth for future generations.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";When considering where to allocate their funds, I believe the company should choose to protect the environment. The current state of the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever, with devastating consequences such as climate change, deforestation, and species extinction. If we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will, and the future of our planet would be at stake. By supporting environmental protection, the company can contribute to preserving natural resources, reducing pollution, and promoting sustainable practices.Moreover, supporting environment protection is a more efficient method of advertising. In today's eco-conscious society, consumers are more likely to trust and support companies that prioritize environmental responsibility. By investing in environmental protection, the company can enhance its brand image, build customer loyalty, and ultimately increase its market share. For instance, companies like Patagonia and Reformation have successfully promoted their environmental efforts, resulting in a significant boost in sales and customer engagement.Additionally, conservation efforts can lead us to a higher standard of living. By protecting natural habitats and preserving biodiversity, we can ensure the long-term health and well-being of our communities. This, in turn, can lead to improved air and water quality, reduced climate-related disasters, and increased access to natural resources. For example, a study by the National Park Service found that every dollar invested in national parks generates approximately $10 in economic benefits, demonstrating the positive impact of environmental conservation on local economies.In conclusion, given the severity of the environmental crisis and the numerous benefits of conservation, I firmly believe that the company should choose to protect the environment. Not only is it a moral imperative, but it also presents a sound business strategy, allowing the company to enhance its reputation, contribute to a higher standard of living, and ultimately, ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In the workplace, we often find ourselves surrounded by diverse individuals with unique personalities, traits, and working styles. As we collaborate with our colleagues to achieve common goals, certain characteristics of a co-worker stand out as particularly valuable. In my opinion, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics: cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.First and foremost, cooperation is essential in a co-worker. When individuals cooperate, they work together seamlessly, sharing ideas and expertise to produce high-quality results. On the other hand, if they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes, misunderstandings, and ultimately, a decrease in productivity. For instance, in a team project, cooperation among members ensures that tasks are delegated effectively, deadlines are met, and the final product is a culmination of collective efforts.Trustworthiness is another vital characteristic of a good co-worker. When we trust our colleagues, we feel secure in sharing our ideas, relying on them to complete tasks, and taking risks together. This trust fosters a sense of security and stability, allowing us to work more efficiently and effectively. For example, if a co-worker is trustworthy, we can confidently assign them a critical task, knowing that they will complete it to the best of their abilities.Lastly, fellowship is crucial in creating a positive and supportive work environment. A co-worker who demonstrates fellowship is approachable, friendly, and willing to lend a helping hand. This characteristic helps to build strong relationships among team members, promoting a sense of belonging and camaraderie. When we enjoy good fellowship with our co-workers, we are more motivated, engaged, and committed to our work. In conclusion, cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship are the three most important characteristics of a good co-worker. These traits are essential in creating a harmonious, productive, and successful work environment, where individuals can thrive and grow together.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;In today's digital age, online classes have become increasingly popular and common in society. As technology continues to advance, the concept of distance learning and online computer classes has gained significant attention. One question that has always sparked my interest is whether online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning. On one hand, online computer classes offer a range of benefits, including flexibility and convenience. Students can learn from the comfort of their own homes, at their own pace, and can easily access course materials and resources. This is particularly beneficial for those with busy schedules or living in remote areas with limited access to educational institutions. Moreover, online classes can also provide personalized learning experiences, as students can interact with instructors and peers from diverse backgrounds, fostering a more inclusive and global learning environment.On the other hand, traditional classroom learning provides a unique set of benefits, including face-to-face interactions, hands-on experiences, and socialization opportunities. Classroom learning allows students to engage in discussions, ask questions, and receive immediate feedback, which can be lacking in online settings. Additionally, traditional classrooms provide a structured learning environment, which can help students stay motivated and focused.However, considering the rapid advancements in technology and the growing demand for online learning, it is possible that online computer classes could complement or even replace traditional classroom learning in certain contexts. With the use of advanced tools and platforms, online classes can now provide immersive and interactive learning experiences that rival those found in traditional classrooms. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the benefits of both online and traditional learning may be the most effective way to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of students in the digital age.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that mandatory attendance is necessary for academic success,,assistantThe debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that mandatory attendance is necessary for academic success, I firmly believe that students should be free not to attend classes. This freedom improves the quality of student life, as it allows them to balance their academic responsibilities with other aspects of their lives, such as part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, and personal relationships. When students are not forced to attend every class, they can manage their time more effectively, leading to reduced stress and improved overall well-being.Furthermore, the option to miss classes enhances learning motivation. When students are given the autonomy to choose when to attend classes, they are more likely to be motivated to learn and engage with the material that truly interests them. This approach encourages self-directed learning, where students take ownership of their education and are more invested in their academic pursuits.Additionally, being free to stay away from classes teaches important life skills, such as time management, responsibility, and self-discipline. In the real world, individuals are not always required to be present in a specific location at a specific time. By allowing students to make their own attendance decisions, universities can help them develop these essential skills, preparing them better for their future careers and personal lives.Another significant benefit of optional class attendance is improved flexibility. Students may need to attend to personal matters, health issues, or other commitments that cannot be rescheduled. By not requiring them to attend every class, universities can accommodate these needs, providing a more flexible and accommodating learning environment. This flexibility is particularly important for students who may have non-traditional schedules or responsibilities, such as caring for a family member or working to support their education.In conclusion, allowing students the freedom not to attend classes is beneficial for their overall educational experience. It enhances their quality of life, boosts learning motivation, teaches valuable life skills, and offers the flexibility that many students need to succeed. By trusting students to make responsible decisions about their attendance, universities can foster a more autonomous, motivated, and well-rounded student body.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, people often find themselves torn between the tranquility of a small town and the vibrancy of a big city. As for me, I would prefer to live in a small town, and for good reason. Small towns have several advantages that make them an attractive choice for residence. Firstly, the weather in small towns is often more pleasant and the environment is cleaner, contributing to a healthier life. Additionally, small towns usually have better facilities, such as parks and community centers, which foster a sense of community and provide ample opportunities for outdoor activities and socialization.Secondly, the living costs in small towns are significantly lower compared to big cities. This is a crucial factor, as living costs are one of the most important concerns in every society. The affordability of housing, food, and other necessities makes small towns more accessible to people from all walks of life. Furthermore, the close-knit community in small towns means that people are more likely to know and look out for each other, creating a stronger sense of belonging and cooperation. In contrast, big cities can often feel impersonal and isolating, with individuals frequently feeling alone despite being surrounded by thousands of people. The anonymity of city life can be overwhelming and disconnecting, whereas in small towns, the familiarity and camaraderie among residents create a warm and supportive environment.In conclusion, the combination of good weather, a healthy lifestyle, better facilities, lower living costs, and a stronger sense of community make small towns the preferable choice for me. The unique blend of natural beauty, economic practicality, and social warmth that small towns offer creates an ideal setting for a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;The migration of young people from rural areas to cities has become a widespread phenomenon in many countries. These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. The reasons behind this trend are multifaceted. On one hand, cities offer better infrastructure, advanced technology, and a wider range of career options, making them more attractive to young people seeking to improve their socio-economic status. On the other hand, rural areas often lack access to quality education, employment opportunities, and modern amenities, pushing young people to leave their homes in pursuit of a brighter future.However, personally, I do not approve of this trend due to the negative effects it has on the quality of life and the environment. The influx of young people into cities leads to overcrowding, increased competition for resources, and a subsequent low quality of life. The strain on urban infrastructure results in issues such as traffic congestion, housing shortages, and elevated crime rates. Furthermore, the migration of young and able-bodied individuals from rural areas accelerates the aging of rural populations, affecting the social and economic fabric of these communities. Additionally, the environmental impact of urbanization, including pollution and loss of biodiversity, cannot be overlooked.While the advantages of urbanization, such as economic growth and cultural diversity, are undeniable, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh them. The depletion of rural areas' workforce and the deterioration of urban environments are significant concerns that need to be addressed. It is essential for governments and policymakers to invest in rural development, providing young people with incentives to stay in or return to their hometowns, thereby promoting a more balanced and sustainable development across all regions. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative consequences of this trend and ensure a better future for both rural and urban communities.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;I strongly agree with the statement that high school students should take a course on basic economics. In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day, and understanding its principles is essential for making informed decisions. The earlier students jump into this area, the more skillful they will be in navigating the complexities of the economic world. By introducing economics in high school, the students will have a head start in developing their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in making sound economic decisions.Taking a course on basic economics will not only benefit students in their personal lives but also prepare them for their future academic pursuits. When students go to college, the basic economic course can also help them in various ways. For instance, it will provide them with a solid foundation to tackle more advanced economic concepts, making their transition to higher education smoother. Moreover, the knowledge of economics will enable them to make more informed decisions about their career choices, investment options, and financial planning, ultimately leading to a more secure and stable financial future.In conclusion, incorporating a basic economics course into the high school curriculum is a prudent decision. It will empower students with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in today's economy, making them more competitive and prepared for the challenges of the real world. By learning about economics early on, students will be better equipped to manage their financial resources, make smart investment decisions, and contribute to the economic growth of their communities. Therefore, I firmly believe that high school students should take a course on basic economics to set themselves up for success in their future endeavors.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that university education should be restricted to only the very best academic students has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach ensures academic excellence, others believe it is unfair and restrictive. In my opinion, I partially disagree with this statement, as I believe university education should be accessible to a broader range of students, not just those with outstanding academic records.On one hand, outstanding academic students are undoubtedly eligible for university education due to their intellectual advantage. They have demonstrated exceptional academic ability, which can be nurtured and developed further in a university setting. These students are likely to make significant contributions to their chosen field, and restricting university education to them would ensure that only the most capable individuals are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel.On the other hand, university is not just about academic studies, but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Students from diverse backgrounds and with varying strengths can benefit from university education, even if they are not necessarily the top academic performers. University provides a platform for students to explore their passions, develop critical thinking, and acquire essential life skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. By restricting university education to only the best academic students, we risk denying opportunities to talented individuals who may not excel academically but have other valuable skills to offer.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. While it may ensure academic excellence, it also limits opportunities for students with diverse talents and strengths. Therefore, I believe that university education should be accessible to a broader range of students, rather than being restricted to only the very best academic students. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and diverse learning environment, where students can develop their unique strengths and contribute to society in meaningful ways.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;The notion that prevention is better than cure has gained significant traction in recent years, and for good reason. In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. This implies that a substantial portion of a country's health budget should be allocated towards health education and preventative measures, rather than solely focusing on treatment.By diverting a large proportion of the health budget towards health education and preventative measures, governments can empower citizens with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle. This can include initiatives such as public awareness campaigns, vaccination programs, and health screenings. These measures have been proven to be highly effective in reducing the incidence of diseases and promoting overall well-being. Moreover, the costs associated with preventative measures are often significantly lower than those associated with treatment, making them a cost-effective solution in the long run.Furthermore, investing in health education can have a ripple effect, influencing not only individual health outcomes but also the overall healthcare system. By promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyles, governments can reduce the burden on healthcare systems, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources. In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. This approach will not only improve health outcomes but also contribute to a more sustainable and equitable healthcare system. By prioritizing prevention, governments can ensure that their citizens receive the care and support they need to thrive, while also promoting a culture of health and wellness that benefits society as a whole.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"The notion that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from school syllabuses to allow students to focus solely on academic subjects is a misguided one. I strongly disagree with this perspective, as I firmly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student's development. Physical education, for instance, is crucial for maintaining students' physical and mental well-being. If it were to be removed from the syllabus, there would be considerable negative effects on students' health, including increased obesity rates, sedentary lifestyles, and related health problems. Moreover, physical education also plays a significant role in teaching students valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.Schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people, equipped with a broad range of skills and knowledge that extend beyond academic excellence. Success in life requires more than just academic knowledge; it also demands practical life skills, such as cooking, time management, and social skills, which are often taught through non-academic subjects. By removing these subjects, schools would be neglecting their responsibility to provide students with a holistic education.In conclusion, non-academic subjects like physical education and cookery are vital components of a student's educational journey. They provide students with essential life skills, promote physical and mental well-being, and foster personal growth. Rather than removing these subjects, schools should strive to strike a balance between academic and non-academic subjects, ensuring that students receive a comprehensive education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When people move to another country, they are often faced with a difficult decision: whether to follow the customs of their new home or to keep their own traditions. This choice can have a significant impact on their ability to integrate into their new society. On one hand, adopting the customs of the new country can make it easier for individuals to assimilate and feel a sense of belonging. By following local norms and practices, people can more easily build relationships with their new neighbors, coworkers, and community members. This, in turn, can lead to a smoother transition and a greater sense of comfort in their new environment.On the other hand, some people prefer to keep their own customs and traditions, even in a new country. While this can be a way to maintain a strong sense of cultural identity, it can also lead to isolation and segregation. When people insist on keeping their own customs and refuse to accept the new ones, they may be regarded as a special group, separate from the rest of society. This can make it challenging for them to fully integrate and participate in the social and cultural life of their new country. In some cases, it may even lead to misunderstandings and conflicts with the local community.In my opinion, adopting the customs of the new country is the preferred choice. By doing so, individuals can demonstrate their willingness to adapt and be a part of their new society. This does not mean that they have to abandon their own cultural heritage, but rather find a way to balance their old traditions with their new life. By being open to new customs and practices, people can enrich their own cultural experience and build stronger connections with the people around them. Ultimately, embracing the customs of a new country can lead to a more harmonious and successful integration into a new society.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;When it comes to achieving success, whether in academics or professional settings, the debate often arises as to whether working in a team or working independently is more important. Despite the importance of working in a team, I still believe that the capability of working alone is more significant. This may seem counterintuitive, given the emphasis often placed on teamwork and collaboration in modern work and educational environments. However, there are several compelling reasons to support the notion that working independently holds greater value.For example, there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Standardized tests, final exams, and assessments that evaluate individual knowledge and understanding are all conducted independently. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college or acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own. The ability to focus, analyze, and solve problems independently is crucial in these situations. It demonstrates not only one's mastery of the subject matter but also their ability to think critically and make decisions without reliance on others.Moreover, working independently fosters a deeper level of personal responsibility and self-discipline. When one works alone, they must motivate themselves, manage their time effectively, and ensure the quality of their work without the support or crutch of a team. These skills are invaluable in both personal and professional development, as they equip individuals with the ability to undertake projects, set goals, and achieve them through their own efforts. In conclusion, while teamwork is undoubtedly important, the ability to work independently is a fundamental skill that underpins individual success and achievement. It is through working alone that one can truly demonstrate their capabilities, knowledge, and character, making it a more significant trait than teamwork.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";The idea that people should focus solely on their jobs and not engage in hobbies or physical activities outside of work is a notion that I strongly disagree with. Some people think that dedicating all our time to our profession is the key to success, but I firmly believe that having hobbies and doing physical activities that are very different from one's work is essential for a healthy and balanced life.Engaging in physical activities and hobbies is the best way to keep fit, both physically and mentally. It allows us to recharge and refocus, which can lead to improved performance and productivity in our jobs. Moreover, doing something for a long time can be boring and monotonous, and having hobbies can refresh our mind and provide a much-needed break from the routine. Hobbies can also provide an outlet for self-expression and creativity, which can be particularly beneficial when we feel depressed or pressured.For instance, playing a musical instrument is a great way to express our emotions and alleviate stress. It provides an opportunity to channel our feelings into something positive and creative, which can be incredibly therapeutic. Furthermore, hobbies can also provide a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can boost our self-esteem and confidence. In conclusion, having hobbies and doing physical activities that are different from one's work is not only beneficial but also necessary for a happy and fulfilling life. It allows us to maintain a healthy work-life balance, reduce stress, and express ourselves in new and exciting ways.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize improving roads and highways or public transportation has been ongoing for years. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noise, and casualties for a long time, posing significant threats to the environment, health, and safety of citizens. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways, because of three crucial reasons.Firstly, improving roads and highways can significantly reduce traffic congestion, which is a major contributor to pollution and noise. By expanding and enhancing the road network, vehicles can move more efficiently, reducing the time spent on the road and subsequently decreasing the emission of harmful gases. Secondly, improving roads and highways can lead to a reduction in casualties. Well-maintained roads with proper signage and markings can minimize the risk of accidents, ensuring a safer commute for drivers and pedestrians alike.Thirdly, improving roads and highways can have a positive impact on the economy. Efficient transportation networks are essential for the movement of goods and services, and by investing in roads and highways, governments can facilitate trade and commerce, leading to economic growth and development. In conclusion, while improving public transportation is also important, I firmly believe that improving roads and highways is the most effective solution to the problems of pollution, noise, and casualties that many countries face. By prioritizing road improvement, governments can create a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transportation system that benefits both the environment and the economy.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The age-old debate about the best way to learn about life has sparked intense discussion among individuals. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. According to my perspective, both ways are good to follow because they both have their own distinct advantages. On one hand, the way of finding out about life through listening to advice is more realistic than the latter. By listening to the experiences and wisdom of family and friends, one can gain valuable insights and avoid potential pitfalls. This approach allows individuals to learn from others' mistakes and successes, thereby saving time and energy.On the other hand, learning through personal experience, though potentially more risky, seems more appropriate to me. By navigating life's challenges and making mistakes, individuals can develop resilience, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Personal experience allows people to learn and grow at their own pace, and the lessons learned are often more memorable and impactful. Moreover, personal experience fosters independence, self-reliance, and confidence, which are essential for personal growth and development. While listening to advice can provide a foundation, it is through personal experience that one can truly understand and apply the lessons learned. In conclusion, both ways of learning about life have their merits, but learning through personal experience is, in my opinion, the more preferable approach, as it allows individuals to develop a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;The statement that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life has sparked a lot of debate among people. In my opinion, childhood is indeed the happiest time of a person's life. During this stage, most people are happier than they are in adulthood. The main reason for this is the simplicity and carefree nature of childhood. A child's daily life typically revolves around school, playing, and sleeping, which are activities that bring them immense joy and satisfaction.In contrast, adulthood is often filled with responsibilities, stress, and pressure, which can weigh heavily on a person's mental and emotional well-being. Children, on the other hand, are free from these burdens and are able to live in the moment, enjoying the simple pleasures of life. Additionally, people are most creative when they were children, as their imagination and curiosity are at their peak. This creativity allows them to express themselves freely and find joy in the simplest of things.The absence of worries and responsibilities in childhood also means that children are able to form strong bonds with their family and friends, which is essential for their emotional development. Furthermore, the memories and experiences gained during childhood play a significant role in shaping a person's personality and outlook on life. Overall, I firmly believe that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life, and it is a stage that should be cherished and nurtured. By embracing the simplicity and wonder of childhood, people can carry the happiness and creativity of this stage into their adult lives, leading to a more fulfilling and joyful existence.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people prepare food, making it easier and more convenient than ever before. With the advancement of technology, food preparation has become a breeze, significantly improving the way people live. One of the primary reasons for this improvement is the invention of kitchen appliances such as microwaves and toasters. These appliances have enabled people to cook their meals quickly and efficiently, saving them a considerable amount of time and effort.In the past, cooking was a tedious and time-consuming process that required hours of preparation and cooking. However, with the advent of modern kitchen appliances, people can now cook their meals in a matter of minutes. This change has been particularly beneficial for housewives, who were traditionally responsible for cooking meals for their families. Liberated from the tedious cooking process, they now have additional time to pursue more meaningful activities such as hobbies, education, or even careers. For instance, a housewife can now use the time she saves from cooking to take up a part-time job, pursue a degree, or simply spend quality time with her family.The ease of food preparation has also had a positive impact on the overall quality of life. With more time on their hands, people can now focus on other aspects of their lives, such as health, relationships, and personal growth. Moreover, the convenience of modern cooking has also enabled people to lead busier and more active lifestyles, without having to compromise on nutrition or taste. In conclusion, the ease of food preparation, made possible by technological advances, has undoubtedly improved the way people live. It has given people more time, freedom, and flexibility to pursue their interests and lead more fulfilling lives.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The debate about when young adults should gain independence from their parents has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that moving out as soon as possible is the key to independence, others believe that living with their families for a longer period is more beneficial. In my opinion, the latter situation is better, and for good reason.Living with parents for a longer time allows young adults to create lasting memories with their families. Sharing daily experiences, traditions, and special occasions with parents and siblings fosters a sense of belonging and strengthens family bonds. For instance, family dinners, game nights, and vacations together become cherished moments that young adults can treasure forever. Moreover, living with parents provides an opportunity for young adults to learn valuable life skills, such as cooking, budgeting, and time management, from their parents.Another significant advantage of living with parents is the financial benefit. By staying at home, young adults can save a substantial amount of money on rent, utilities, and food. This enables them to allocate their earnings towards education, career development, or savings, setting them up for long-term financial stability. In a word, parents can save money, if their children live with them longer, as they do not have to support their children financially when they move out. Additionally, parents can offer valuable advice and guidance on important life decisions, such as career choices, relationships, and investments, which can help young adults avoid costly mistakes.In conclusion, living with parents for a longer time has numerous benefits, including creating lasting memories, saving money, and receiving valuable advice. While independence is essential, it is not necessarily tied to moving out immediately. By staying at home, young adults can enjoy a more stable and supportive transition into adulthood, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling life.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;I strongly disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. In fact, zoos play a vital role in our society, serving multiple purposes that benefit both humans and animals. Firstly, a zoo is a valuable educational resource, where people, especially children, can learn about different species, their habitats, and behaviors. By observing and interacting with animals in a controlled environment, visitors can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the natural world, fostering a sense of responsibility and conservation.Moreover, zoos are instrumental in helping to preserve endangered species and prevent extinction. Many zoos participate in breeding programs for threatened animals, providing a safe haven for them to thrive and multiply. For example, the California Condor and the Black Footed Ferret are two species that have been successfully bred in captivity and released back into the wild, thanks to the efforts of zoos. This conservation work is essential for maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems and preserving biodiversity.In addition to their educational and conservation roles, zoos are also significant tourist attractions, contributing to the local economy. They provide employment opportunities, generate revenue, and stimulate economic growth. A visit to the zoo can be a fun and entertaining experience for families, promoting social interaction and community engagement. Many zoos also offer behind-the-scenes tours, animal encounters, and interactive exhibits, making them a popular destination for visitors from around the world.In conclusion, zoos have a multitude of purposes, from education and conservation to tourism and community engagement. They provide a unique platform for people to connect with nature, learn about wildlife, and contribute to the preservation of our planet's precious species. Therefore, I firmly believe that zoos have a valuable and indispensable role in our society, and their importance should not be underestimated.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;"The statement that ""parents are the best teacher for young children"" is one that I strongly agree with. From the moment a child is born, parents play a pivotal role in their development, teaching them the most basic yet essential skills such as how to walk and speak. These early lessons lay the foundation for a child's future learning and development. Moreover, parents are not just teachers of physical and linguistic skills, but also of moral values and principles that shape a child into a good person.Based on love and a deep desire to see their children succeed, parents strive to create the best possible conditions for their development. This includes providing a nurturing environment, both physically and emotionally, where children feel safe and encouraged to learn and grow. Parents make sacrifices to ensure their children have access to quality education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities that are essential for their holistic development. The unconditional love and support from parents give children the confidence to explore, learn from their mistakes, and develop resilience.Furthermore, parents are uniquely positioned to understand their child's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style, allowing them to tailor their teaching and support to meet their child's individual needs. This personalized approach to learning and development is something that formal education systems often cannot replicate. By preparing children for their future life, parents set them up for success, not just academically, but also socially and emotionally. In conclusion, the influence and impact parents have on young children's lives make them the best teachers. Their love, dedication, and personalized approach to teaching make them indispensable in shaping the next generation into capable, compassionate, and well-rounded individuals."
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The impact of television on young children has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people argue that television has a profoundly negative influence on children, while others believe that its effects can be largely positive. In my opinion, I partially agree that television can have detrimental effects on young minds, but I also believe that if utilized wisely, the benefits can outweigh the drawbacks.Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for young viewers. Exposure to violent or explicit content can desensitize children to aggressive behavior and promote unhealthy habits. Furthermore, excessive television watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. These concerns are valid and highlight the potential risks associated with unregulated television viewing.However, if children can use TV programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Educational programs, such as documentaries, science shows, and children's educational series, can enhance knowledge, foster creativity, and promote critical thinking. Additionally, television can provide a window into different cultures, traditions, and ways of life, broadening children's understanding and tolerance of the world around them. Parents and caregivers can play a significant role in ensuring that children watch television responsibly by selecting appropriate content, setting limits, and engaging in discussions about what they are watching.In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns about the potential negative impacts of television on young children, I believe that with wise and moderated use, the benefits of television can surpass its drawbacks. By being mindful of the content and duration of television viewing, parents can harness its potential to educate, inform, and inspire their children, ultimately contributing to their healthy development and growth.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;The notion that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives has been a topic of debate among entrepreneurs and human resource experts. Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of three main crucial reasons.Firstly, hiring employees for life can lead to stagnation and complacency. When employees feel secure in their jobs, they may become less motivated to innovate and improve their skills, which can ultimately hinder the growth and development of the company. Secondly, a lifetime employment contract can limit the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and technological advancements. Companies need to be agile and responsive to new opportunities and challenges, and a rigid employment structure can prevent them from doing so. Lastly, lifetime employment can also lead to a lack of diversity and fresh perspectives within the company. When employees are hired for life, they may become entrenched in their ways of thinking and working, which can stifle creativity and innovation.In conclusion, while hiring employees for life may provide a sense of security and stability, it is not a viable or desirable option for businesses in today's fast-paced and rapidly changing work environment. Companies need to be able to respond quickly to new challenges and opportunities, and a flexible and dynamic employment structure is essential for achieving this goal. By not employing workers for their entire lives, businesses can foster a culture of innovation, adaptability, and continuous improvement, which is essential for success in today's competitive market.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";"The statement ""Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" is a notion that has sparked debate among individuals. While some may argue that adulthood brings greater happiness, I firmly agree with this statement. Childhood, in several aspects, is indeed the happiest period of one's life.One of the primary reasons is that childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most. Everything is new and fascinating, from the simplest things like bubbles and balloons to the complexity of nature and the world around them. This sense of wonder and awe contributes significantly to the joy and happiness of childhood. For instance, who can forget the magic of Christmas morning or the thrill of birthdays, where the air is filled with excitement and anticipation?Another great thing about childhood is the freedom to imagine and say what you think without the burden of societal expectations or self-censorship. Children have the liberty to express themselves freely, whether through art, play, or simple conversation, without fear of judgment. This uninhibited expression of thoughts and feelings is a source of immense happiness and fulfillment. Additionally, the imagination knows no bounds during childhood, allowing children to create their own worlds, stories, and characters, further enriching their experience of life.In conclusion, the combination of a sense of wonder, the freedom to express oneself, and the limitless bounds of imagination make childhood a uniquely happy period. While adulthood may bring its own set of joys and fulfillments, the carefree nature and endless curiosity of childhood undoubtedly make it the happiest time of a person's life. As such, it is essential to cherish and nurture this period, allowing children to grow and flourish in an environment that fosters happiness and development."
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";The notion that learning about the past has no value for those living in the present is a misguided one. Many people think that the past has nothing to do with the present, as time never stops, and therefore, what happened before is irrelevant to our current lives. However, this perspective overlooks the numerous valuable lessons and knowledge that can be gleaned from history.In reality, the past is replete with experiences, both successes and mistakes, that can inform and enrich our present. By studying historical events, we can learn from the errors of our predecessors, avoiding the repetition of costly mistakes. Conversely, we can also draw inspiration from the achievements of the past, using them as a foundation to build upon and innovate. The accumulation of knowledge in various fields of study, such as science, technology, and sociology, is a direct result of past discoveries and advancements.Ignoring the past would mean disregarding the hard-won wisdom and breakthroughs that have brought us to where we are today. Instead, we should make full use of the past, analyzing it to understand how it has shaped our current world. This retrospective understanding can guide us in making informed decisions for a brighter future. History teaches us about the complexities of human nature, the evolution of ideas, and the consequences of actions, all of which are essential for navigating the complexities of the present.In conclusion, learning about the past is not only valuable but necessary for those living in the present. It offers a wealth of knowledge, cautionary tales, and inspirations that can significantly enhance our lives and the decisions we make. By embracing and learning from history, we can pave the way for a more enlightened, progressive, and successful future. Therefore, it is paramount that we continue to study, appreciate, and apply the lessons of the past to forge a better tomorrow.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The investment of governments in outer space travel has sparked a heated debate about its reasonableness. Space exploration, which has been possible for humans since the 20th century, has opened up new avenues for discovery and advancement. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save the living of humanity in the future. By exploring space, we can gain valuable insights into the universe, unlock new technologies, and potentially discover new resources that can sustain human life.Historically, space exploration has been used as a tool for military power, particularly during the Cold War era. The United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a space race, with each side attempting to outdo the other in space exploration and technology. This competition drove innovation and led to numerous breakthroughs in fields such as rocketry, materials science, and computer technology. Although the primary motivation was military dominance, the spin-off benefits have been immense, with many of these technologies being adapted for civilian use.Moreover, space exploration can provide a safeguard against global catastrophes, such as asteroid impacts or supervolcanic eruptions, by identifying potential threats and developing strategies for mitigation. Additionally, space-based resources, like solar energy and helium-3 for nuclear fusion, could become crucial for humanity's energy needs in the future. Therefore, I firmly believe that the investment in space exploration is a prudent and forward-thinking decision, essential for ensuring the long-term survival and prosperity of humanity. By continuing to explore and understand space, we are, in effect, investing in our own future.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day, and its impact on our lives cannot be overstated. While some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. In my opinion, the statement ""Television has destroyed communication among friends and family"" is an exaggeration and not entirely accurate.On the contrary, television has provided a platform for friends and family to come together and share experiences. For instance, watching a favorite TV show or a sporting event can be a great way to bond with loved ones. Families can gather around the TV to watch a movie or a popular series, sparking conversations and discussions about the plot, characters, and themes. Moreover, television has also made it possible for people to stay updated about current events, news, and social issues, which can lead to meaningful conversations and debates among family and friends.Furthermore, television has also provided a common ground for people to connect with each other, regardless of their age or background. For example, a grandparent and a grandchild can watch a cooking show or a nature documentary together, sharing their thoughts and opinions. This shared experience can help to bridge the gap between different generations and foster a sense of togetherness.In conclusion, while it is true that excessive TV watching can lead to social isolation, I firmly believe that television has not destroyed communication among friends and family. On the contrary, it has provided a platform for people to come together, share experiences, and engage in meaningful conversations. When used in moderation, television can be a powerful tool to strengthen relationships and create lasting memories among loved ones."
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;"The age-old adage ""to let someone make their own mistakes"" has sparked a heated debate among friends and scholars alike. The statement ""letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship"" has garnered both support and criticism. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion that I disagree with this statement.Firstly, taking action to prevent a friend from making a mistake demonstrates a genuine concern for their well-being. For instance, if a friend is about to invest in a dubious business venture, it is a friend's duty to warn them of the potential risks. By speaking up, one can help their friend avoid financial ruin and preserve their relationship. In contrast, letting a friend make a mistake out of fear of damaging the friendship may lead to long-term resentment and damage to the relationship.Secondly, taking action to prevent a mistake can actually strengthen a friendship in the long run. When a friend takes the time to offer constructive advice or intervene in a potentially harmful situation, it shows that they value and care about the other person's life. This can foster a deeper sense of trust and appreciation, ultimately leading to a more resilient and meaningful friendship. For example, if a friend is struggling with addiction, intervening and encouraging them to seek help can be a difficult but ultimately rewarding experience that brings the friends closer together.In conclusion, while letting a friend make their own mistakes may seem like the easiest option, I firmly believe that taking action to prevent harm is a more valuable and supportive approach. By speaking up and offering guidance, friends can demonstrate their commitment to each other's well-being and build a stronger, more enduring relationship."
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;In my view, it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare for adult life for several reasons. Firstly, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. This independence allows them to manage their finances, understand the value of money, and make wise decisions about their spending. By earning their own money, teenagers develop a sense of self-sufficiency and responsibility, which is essential for their future.Moreover, having a part-time job teaches teenagers important life skills, such as time management, discipline, and accountability. For instance, if a student is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. Under these circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rules and take responsibility for his work. This experience will help him understand the consequences of his actions and develop a strong work ethic. Additionally, the pressure of meeting deadlines and completing tasks will help him prioritize his work and balance his school life with his job.Overall, taking a part-time job is an invaluable experience for teenage children as it prepares them for the realities of adult life. It not only provides them with financial independence but also teaches them essential life skills, such as responsibility, discipline, and time management. By encouraging their teenage children to take a part-time job, parents can help them develop into capable and self-sufficient individuals who are ready to face the challenges of adulthood.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;The debate about whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that the countryside offers a more peaceful and serene environment, I firmly disagree and believe that growing up in a big city is more beneficial for children. In a big city, there are more kinds of people and more things to do, which can broaden children's horizons and provide them with a diverse range of experiences. They can interact with people from different backgrounds, cultures, and professions, which can foster their social skills and understanding of the world. Moreover, cities offer a wide range of entertainment, educational, and recreational activities that can stimulate children's curiosity and creativity. On the other hand, growing up in the countryside can be quite limiting. For instance, if a child wants to pursue higher education, they have to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university, which can be a daunting task. Furthermore, the countryside is often plagued by gossips, which can be detrimental to a child's self-esteem and emotional well-being. The limited opportunities and lack of anonymity in rural areas can also make a child's life feel really limited, stifling their personal growth and development. Personally, if someday I have children, I'm absolutely sure that they will grow up in the city. I want them to have access to the best educational and cultural resources, to be exposed to different perspectives and ways of life, and to have the freedom to make their own choices and forge their own paths. In conclusion, while the countryside has its charms, I firmly believe that growing up in a big city is better for children, offering them a more diverse, stimulating, and liberating environment that can help them reach their full potential.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;I strongly agree with the statement that parents are the best teachers. The things that parents say have great power to their child, more power than any friend or other adult could have. The words of encouragement, guidance, and discipline spoken by parents can shape a child's thoughts, feelings, and actions, and have a lasting impact on their development. For instance, a parent's praise can boost a child's confidence and self-esteem, while their criticism can help a child learn from their mistakes.Furthermore, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. From a young age, children look up to their parents as role models and spend a significant amount of time with them, observing and imitating their behavior. This prolonged exposure provides parents with ample opportunities to impart their values, skills, and knowledge to their child. Whether it's teaching a child how to read, ride a bike, or cook a meal, parents are always there to guide and support their child's learning process.Additionally, children usually mirror themselves on their parents, adopting their habits, attitudes, and beliefs. Parents' influence on their child's behavior and personality is profound, and their teaching extends beyond academics to important life skills like manners, morals, and social etiquette. By being a constant presence in their child's life, parents can instill values like honesty, kindness, and responsibility, which are essential for a child's overall development. In conclusion, parents play a unique and significant role in a child's life, and their teaching has a profound impact on shaping their child's future. Therefore, I firmly believe that parents are indeed the best teachers.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The advent of modern food preparation methods has revolutionized the way people live, making it easier and more convenient to access a wide variety of cuisines. With the development of advanced cooking techniques and industrial food production, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. For instance, the invention of microwave ovens and pre-packaged meals has saved people a significant amount of time, which can be utilized for other activities such as leisure, work, or spending time with family and friends.Moreover, the increased availability of diverse ingredients and ready-to-eat meals has enabled people to explore different flavors and culinary traditions from around the world. This has not only broadened people's palates but also facilitated cultural exchange and understanding. Furthermore, the ease of food preparation has also made it possible for people with busy schedules to maintain a healthy diet, as they can quickly prepare nutritious meals without sacrificing flavor or quality.However, it is essential for people to be careful with what they eat, as some industrial foods are very bad for their health. Processed and packaged foods often contain high amounts of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, which can lead to obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related health issues. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between convenience and nutrition, opting for whole foods and homemade meals whenever possible. In conclusion, the ease of food preparation has undoubtedly improved the way people live, offering more convenience, diversity, and flavor. Nevertheless, it is vital to prioritize health and nutrition, being mindful of the potential risks associated with industrial foods. By doing so, people can fully capitalize on the benefits of modern food preparation while maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The issue at hand is whether schools should require students to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning. In this debate, the argument that students should be required to take regular standardized tests is a strong one. Standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. These exams provide a consistent and unbiased measure of a student's knowledge and understanding, allowing teachers to assess their progress accurately.In addition, many teachers rely heavily on exam results while grading the class, making the usage of exams the superior option for them. By using standardized tests, teachers can compare the performance of their students to others in the same grade level, identifying areas where students may need extra support or enrichment. This information can be used to inform instruction and make data-driven decisions about teaching strategies. Moreover, Regular standardized tests also help to ensure that students are held to high standards and are prepared for future academic challenges. They provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills, and to identify areas where they need to improve. By requiring students to take regular standardized tests, schools can promote a culture of accountability and academic excellence. In conclusion, requiring students to take regular standardized tests is essential for ensuring that students are learning and meeting academic standards. These tests provide a fair and accurate measure of student knowledge, help teachers to identify areas where students need support, and promote a culture of accountability and academic excellence. Therefore, schools should require students to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";I strongly agree with the statement that a university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars. In today's world, the cost of education is skyrocketing, making it increasingly difficult for many aspiring students to pursue higher education. As a result, many individuals are forced to opt for self-financed education, which can be a significant financial burden. This not only limits access to education but also creates a barrier for those who are genuinely passionate about learning.On the other hand, the idea of providing free education has the potential to inspire and motivate scholars who are truly dedicated to their studies. When education is free, it allows students to focus on their academic pursuits without the weight of financial stress. This, in turn, can lead to a more engaged and committed student body, as individuals are able to concentrate on their studies and pursue their interests without the burden of tuition fees.Furthermore, providing free university education can have far-reaching benefits for society as a whole. It can lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which can drive innovation and economic growth. Additionally, it can help to reduce income inequality, as individuals from all backgrounds are given the opportunity to access higher education, regardless of their financial situation. In conclusion, providing free university education is not only a moral imperative, but also a sound investment in the future of our society. It has the potential to unlock the talents and abilities of individuals, and inspire a new generation of scholars to reach their full potential.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of university professors has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they should focus more on research, while others believe their primary responsibility is educating students. In my view, professors should spend more time doing research rather than educating students, and there are several compelling reasons for this stance.Professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching. However, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. This dual role is essential to the academic ecosystem, where professors are expected to impart knowledge to students while also advancing their fields through research. A professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons. Firstly, research is a key driver of innovation and progress. By dedicating more time to research, the professor can make groundbreaking discoveries, publish papers, and contribute to the global academic community. This not only enhances their reputation but also elevates the standing of their institution. Secondly, research informs and improves teaching. When professors are actively engaged in research, they can bring real-world examples and cutting-edge knowledge into the classroom, making their teaching more relevant and engaging. This synergy between research and teaching ultimately benefits the students, as they learn from instructors who are at the forefront of their fields. Moreover, in today's fast-paced, ever-evolving world, research is crucial for staying updated with the latest developments. Professors who focus on research are better equipped to prepare students for the challenges of the future, by incorporating the latest findings and methodologies into their curriculum. In conclusion, while teaching is a vital part of a professor's job, I firmly believe that they should allocate more time to research. This approach not only advances academic knowledge but also enriches the educational experience for students, preparing them for success in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;The influence of television and movies on people's behavior is a widely debated topic. There is no doubt that television or movies influence people's behavior, shaping their thoughts, actions, and lifestyles. However, it is unfortunate that this influence is often more detrimental than beneficial. In general, television and movies tend to have a more negative impact on our behavior than a positive one.One of the primary ways in which television and movies negatively influence behavior is by promoting unhealthy eating habits. The constant advertisement and depiction of junk food in media can lead people to consume more rubbish food, resulting in a range of health problems. For instance, a study has shown that children who watch more television are more likely to request and consume unhealthy foods. This can have long-term consequences, such as obesity and related diseases.Furthermore, excessive television and movie watching can lead to a decline in social interactions and relationships. People spend less time with their friends and family, and more time isolated in front of screens. This can result in feelings of loneliness and disconnection, ultimately affecting mental health. Additionally, the portrayal of unrealistic and idealized characters in movies and television shows can lead people to strive for unattainable perfection, causing them to be someone they are not. This can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.In conclusion, while television and movies can have some positive influences, such as promoting empathy and understanding, the negative impacts outweigh the benefits. It is essential for individuals to be aware of these influences and to consume media responsibly, maintaining a balance between entertainment and real-life interactions. By doing so, we can mitigate the harmful effects of television and movies on our behavior and promote a healthier and more positive lifestyle.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When traveling to new destinations, many individuals prioritize visiting museums as a fundamental part of their exploration. The reasons behind this are multifaceted and compelling. Firstly, museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, offering visitors a deeper understanding and appreciation of the local heritage. For instance, a museum showcasing ancient artifacts and historical documents can give insight into the origins and evolution of a society, providing context to the contemporary landscape.Moreover, visiting museums is not only an educational experience but also a social one. It offers the chance for making friends with fellow travelers or locals who share similar interests. In a museum setting, discussions and conversations can naturally emerge among strangers, facilitated by the shared experience of observing and learning from exhibits. This social aspect of museum visits can lead to meaningful connections and friendships, especially among travelers who may be looking to expand their social networks while abroad.Furthermore, the knowledge gained from visiting museums can extend beyond the confines of the museum itself. It can bring the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge that can be applied in various social situations, enabling individuals to participate in conversations with a newfound sense of authority and insight. For example, understanding the historical context of a particular artwork or artifact can make a person more confident and engaging in discussions about art, history, or culture, thereby enriching their social interactions.In conclusion, people visit museums while traveling to immerse themselves in the local culture, to learn about its history, and to potentially forge new connections with like-minded individuals. The experience is both enriching and expansive, offering a blend of intellectual stimulation and social engagement that enhances the overall travel experience.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"I disagree with the statement that in a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others. In today's fast-paced society, it is more important than ever to maintain a sense of courtesy and respect towards those around us. As the old adage goes, ""a man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues,"" highlighting the significance of good manners in revealing one's character. A person with good manners will inevitably give others a fine personal impression, making a positive impact on those they interact with.Politeness and tender words have a profound effect on both the speaker and the listener. Not only can they help the speaker earn a good reputation, but they can also encourage and uplift those who are in need. A simple act of kindness, such as holding the door for someone or offering a warm smile, can go a long way in brightening someone's day. In a world where people are often stressed and overwhelmed, a little bit of politeness can be a beacon of hope and kindness.Moreover, expecting people to be polite to others sets a high standard for human interaction, promoting a culture of empathy and understanding. By being polite, we show that we value and respect the people around us, regardless of how busy or crowded our surroundings may be. In conclusion, I firmly believe that politeness is essential in our daily lives, and we should continue to expect and strive for kindness and courtesy towards others, even in the midst of a busy and crowded world. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and compassionate society, where everyone feels valued and respected."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;I strongly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Some people advocate that the difficulties people encounter at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. From my point of view, I am in favor of the former statement that some tough experiences people have before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things that happen. When individuals face difficulties, they learn to appreciate the small joys in life and do not take things for granted. For instance, a person who has experienced poverty may develop a greater appreciation for the value of money and make more responsible financial decisions in the future. This mindset helps them make the most of the resources they have and live a more fulfilling life.What's more, people who have experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in trouble. Because they already have experience overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of their ability to cope with challenges. This calmness and confidence enable them to approach problems with a clear mind, think more critically, and make better decisions. As a result, they are more resilient and better equipped to handle future setbacks. In conclusion, the tough experiences people have in their lives can indeed become valuable lessons for the future, teaching them to appreciate the little things and to stay calm in the face of adversity.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The debate about whether life in a city is better than life in the countryside has been ongoing for years. While some people prefer the peaceful and serene atmosphere of the countryside, others argue that life in a city is much better. In my opinion, city life has several advantages over rural life.Firstly, the city offers a much better education system, with a wide range of schools, colleges, and universities providing high-quality education. Additionally, there are more work opportunities available in the city, with numerous industries and businesses operating in urban areas. This provides individuals with a greater chance of finding employment and advancing their careers.Another significant advantage of city life is the cultural diversity that it offers. With a larger population, urban areas are melting pots of different cultures, ethnicities, and lifestyles. This diversity enriches the city's cultural scene, with a wide range of festivals, events, and activities to participate in. Furthermore, the city's transportation system is well-developed, with frequent buses and trains making it easy to get around and communicate with others.In contrast, while the countryside has its own charm, with many beautiful and peaceful places to rest and relax, the advantages of city life far outweigh those of rural life. The countryside's remote location can make it difficult to access education and employment opportunities, and the lack of cultural diversity can make life seem dull and monotonous. Overall, while the countryside has its own advantages, I firmly believe that life in a city is much better, offering a wide range of opportunities, cultural diversity, and better communication.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;"The statement ""Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does"" has sparked a debate among many. As people become more and more affluent, they start to pay attention to mental requirements like happiness, which was previously overshadowed by the pursuit of material wealth. While I accept that a job can offer happiness to some individuals, I firmly believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.A person's living environment plays a significant role in shaping their overall well-being and happiness. The quality of air, access to green spaces, and the sense of community in a neighborhood can greatly impact one's mental health. For instance, living in a polluted and noisy city can lead to increased stress levels, whereas residing in a peaceful and natural setting can promote relaxation and calmness. Furthermore, a living environment that provides opportunities for social interaction, such as community centers, parks, and public transportation, can help individuals build strong social connections, which are essential for happiness.In contrast, while a job can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, it is not the sole determinant of happiness. Many people have jobs that are unfulfilling or stressful, yet they still manage to find happiness in their personal lives. Moreover, a job is just one aspect of a person's life, whereas their living environment is a constant presence that can either uplift or drain their mental energy. Therefore, I believe that living environment has a more profound impact on a person's happiness than their job. As people continue to prioritize their mental well-being, it is essential to recognize the significance of living environment in promoting happiness and overall quality of life."
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;In today's digital age, communication has undergone a significant transformation, relying heavily on technology. With the rise of electronic means of communication, people have multiple options to choose from, including voice mail, e-mail, telephone, and the traditional face-to-face method. While each has its own set of advantages, I personally prefer communicating via e-mail, and my preference stems from three key reasons: convenience, honest expression, and fluency in communicating.Firstly, e-mail offers unparalleled convenience. It allows me to send and receive messages at any time, without being confined to a specific time zone or location. This flexibility is especially valuable in a world where schedules can be unpredictable and time differences between locations can hinder real-time communication. Unlike telephone calls or face-to-face meetings, which require both parties to be available simultaneously, e-mail can be checked and responded to at the recipient's leisure.Secondly, e-mail facilitates honest expression. When communicating through writing, I find that I can express myself more honestly and thoroughly than through spoken word. The act of typing out my thoughts gives me a moment to reflect on what I want to say, ensuring that my message is clear and sincere. This aspect is particularly important in professional or formal communications where clarity and precision are paramount.Lastly, e-mail enables fluency in communicating. It provides a permanent record of conversations, which can be invaluable for referencing later or clarifying any misunderstandings. Unlike voice mail or telephone conversations, which can be fleeting and prone to misinterpretation, e-mail messages remain intact, allowing for a clear and ongoing dialogue.In conclusion, while various methods of communication have their unique benefits, e-mail stands out to me due to its convenience, the honesty it allows in expression, and the fluency it brings to communication. In an era where technology dominates the landscape of communication, e-mail strikes a perfect balance between traditional personal touch and modern efficiency.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";I strongly agree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While television has been a staple of entertainment for decades, its negative impact on interpersonal relationships cannot be ignored. In my opinion, the bad effects of television far outweigh its benefits, particularly when it comes to communication among loved ones.One of the primary reasons television has hindered communication is that it has made people less inclined to engage in conversations with each other. When a favorite show is on, individuals tend to become completely absorbed in the program, often ignoring those around them. This obsession with television shows can lead to a lack of meaningful interactions, causing relationships to suffer. For instance, when a family gathers to watch their favorite program, they rarely engage in discussions or share their thoughts and feelings with each other.Furthermore, television shows often distract people from what is truly important in life. The constant stream of entertainment can lead to a sense of escapism, causing individuals to neglect their relationships and responsibilities. When people become too invested in television, they may begin to prioritize it over quality time with friends and family, ultimately damaging their bonds with loved ones. A person who has favorite programs tends to be obsessed with them when they are on air, leading to a decline in face-to-face interactions and deep, meaningful conversations.In conclusion, while television may provide some benefits, its detrimental effects on communication among friends and family cannot be overlooked. The medium has made people less likely to engage in conversations, distracted them from what is truly important, and led to an unhealthy obsession with entertainment. As a result, I firmly believe that television has destroyed communication among friends and family, and it is essential to maintain a balance between television watching and meaningful interactions with loved ones.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a plethora of options to suit individual preferences. While many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally, I believe that communicating by emails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea, which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, it is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case, it is not so difficult to write a voice mail. This method alleviates the anxiety and nervousness associated with cold calling, allowing individuals to express themselves more comfortably. Moreover, emails and voice mails provide a paper trail, which can be useful for future reference, especially in professional settings.Secondly, you can write an email at any time of the day. As for me, this flexibility is invaluable. I can compose and send emails during my most productive hours, without being constrained by the recipient's schedule. This asynchronous nature of email communication ensures that both parties can respond when it is convenient for them, facilitating communication across different time zones and schedules.Furthermore, emails and voice mails allow for more thoughtful and considered communication. Unlike face-to-face or telephone conversations, which can be spontaneous and sometimes regrettable, written communication provides the opportunity to reflect on one's words before hitting send. This reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings and miscommunications, leading to more effective and efficient exchange of ideas.In conclusion, while face-to-face and telephone conversations have their own advantages, I firmly believe that communicating by emails or voice mails is preferable due to its ease, flexibility, and the opportunity for more thoughtful expression. As technology continues to advance, it will be interesting to see how our communication preferences evolve, but for now, emails and voice mails remain my preferred mode of communication.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The age-old adage ""haste makes waste"" is a statement that I wholeheartedly agree with. This phrase suggests that acting quickly and without careful consideration can lead to undesirable outcomes and ultimately, a waste of resources, time, and effort. I firmly believe that every fast and not well-thought decision is a wasted one, as it often leads to probable bad results.Making quick decisions without weighing the pros and cons can have severe consequences. For instance, a person who hastily quits their job without having a backup plan may end up struggling financially and regret their decision later. Similarly, a student who rushes through their studies without properly understanding the material may perform poorly on exams, ultimately wasting their time and effort. Hurried decisions, not only go to waste but also could affect the entire life of the person, leading to a lifetime of regret and ""what ifs"".Moreover, history is replete with examples of how hasty decisions have led to disastrous outcomes. For example, a company that quickly launches a product without thorough testing and market research may end up recalling the product due to defects or poor sales, resulting in a significant financial loss. On the other hand, taking the time to carefully consider options, weighing the pros and cons, and thinking through the potential consequences can lead to more informed and effective decision-making.In conclusion, the statement ""haste makes waste"" is a wise saying that cautions against the dangers of acting impulsively. Every fast and not well-thought decision is indeed a wasted one, and making quick decisions can lead to probable bad results. It is essential to take the time to think through our choices and consider the potential outcomes to avoid wasting our resources, time, and effort. By doing so, we can make more informed decisions that will ultimately lead to better outcomes and a more fulfilling life."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile is undoubtedly one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. In my opinion, the automobile has improved modern life in numerous ways. Firstly, the automobile provides unparalleled convenience and flexibility,. With a car, people can travel whenever and wherever they want, without being restricted by public transport schedules or routes. This has opened up a world of possibilities, allowing people to explore new places, visit distant friends and family, and enjoy a wider range of recreational activities.The automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world, broadening their horizons and fostering cultural exchange. For instance, a person living in a rural area can easily visit a city, experience its culture, and return home, all in a single day. This increased mobility has also enabled people to access better job opportunities, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities, which are often located far from their residences. Furthermore, the automobile has played a crucial role in facilitating the growth of international trade and commerce, by enabling the rapid transportation of goods and services across long distances.In conclusion, while some people may argue that the automobile has caused serious problems, such as traffic congestion and environmental pollution, I firmly believe that its benefits outweigh its drawbacks. The automobile has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another, and its impact on modern life is undeniable. As the world continues to urbanize and grow, it is likely that the automobile will remain an essential part of our daily lives, and its importance will only continue to increase.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The statement that it is better for children to choose jobs similar to their parents' jobs has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that following in one's parents' footsteps can limit personal growth and autonomy, I firmly agree with the statement. Choosing a job that is similar to one's parents' job can greatly benefit one's career. As parents are already involved in the same environment, they can offer invaluable support and guidance to their children.For instance, parents can provide domain knowledge and industry-related information, which can be a significant advantage in a competitive job market. They can also offer insights into the day-to-day responsibilities and challenges of the job, helping their children make informed decisions. Moreover, their established network and connections within the industry can open doors to new opportunities and mentorship. This can lead to a more seamless transition into the workforce and a more successful career.Some may argue that the job market is constantly evolving, and the conditions of the past are vastly different from those of the present. However, I believe that parents can still play a crucial role in leading their children to a smoother career path. Their experience and expertise can help their children navigate the ever-changing job landscape, and their guidance can be tailored to the current market conditions. Ultimately, having a parent in a similar field can provide a unique opportunity for mentorship, networking, and career advancement. Therefore, I firmly believe that choosing a job similar to one's parents' job can be a wise decision, as it can lead to a more successful and fulfilling career.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The question of whether professional athletes and entertainers deserve their high salaries has sparked a heated debate in recent years. On one hand, professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine, with some contracts reaching tens of millions of dollars. This has led some people to argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. They believe that such exorbitant salaries are unjustified and create an unhealthy disparity in society.However, from my prospect, I believe that professional athletes do deserve their high payment. Firstly, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence. Professional athletes possess exceptional skills, dedication, and physical prowess that set them apart from others. Their hard work, sacrifices, and achievements justify their high earnings. The market demand for their services, coupled with their limited career span, also warrants their high compensation.Secondly, such high salaries can guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. With the financial security provided by their high salaries, athletes can focus on their training, recovery, and performance without worrying about their financial well-being. This, in turn, enables them to deliver exceptional performances, entertain millions of fans, and drive the sports industry forward. Furthermore, their high salaries also contribute to the overall economy, creating jobs, stimulating local businesses, and generating tax revenue.In conclusion, while the salaries of professional athletes may seem excessive to some, I firmly believe that they are deserved. Their unique talents, dedication, and contributions to the sports industry justify their high earnings. Rather than being unfair, their salaries reflect the value they bring to the table, and the market forces that drive the sports industry.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;The question of whether young children, aged 5-10, should be required to learn music and art in addition to the core subjects of math, science, history, and language is a significant one. In many families, music and art are already on the must-learn list of parents, highlighting their importance in a child's educational journey. In my opinion, incorporating music and art into a child's curriculum is not only beneficial but essential for their overall development.It's very suitable for children to develop their senses and explore their creativity when they are young. Music and art education can significantly enhance a child's sensory development, allowing them to perceive and understand the world around them in a more nuanced and multifaceted way. These subjects foster creativity, imagination, and self-expression, which are crucial components of a child's cognitive and emotional growth.Moreover, learning music and art are life-long cultivations worthy of investing. The skills and appreciation developed through these subjects can stay with a child throughout their life, providing them with avenues for personal fulfillment and enrichment. Engaging with music and art can also nourish a child's temperament, helping them develop emotional intelligence, empathy, and social skills. These are essential life skills that can benefit a child in all aspects of their life, from personal relationships to professional pursuits.In conclusion, requiring young children to learn music and art, alongside traditional subjects, is a forward-thinking approach to education. It acknowledges the holistic development of a child, preparing them not just academically, but also creatively, emotionally, and socially. By investing in music and art education, we are investing in the well-rounded development of our children, equipping them with the skills, sensitivity, and creativity needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;The age-old question of how to spark students' interest in a particular subject has been a longstanding concern for educators. In my opinion, the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school. By doing so, teachers can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, making the subject more relatable and relevant to students' everyday lives.When teachers illustrate the real-world implications of a subject, students are more likely to develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of its significance. By explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have a vivid impression of its importance and relevance, thus becoming more active in acquiring knowledge. For instance, a math teacher can explain how mathematical concepts are used in finance, engineering, or even cooking, making the subject more engaging and interactive. Similarly, a science teacher can demonstrate how scientific principles are applied in medical research, environmental conservation, or technological innovations, making the subject more fascinating and accessible.This approach not only enhances students' motivation to learn but also helps them to see the bigger picture and understand how the subject fits into their broader goals and aspirations. By connecting the subject to real-life scenarios, teachers can inspire students to explore and discover the practical applications of the subject, fostering a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm. In conclusion, explaining how a subject can be applied to students' lives outside school is an effective way to generate interest and engagement, making learning a more enjoyable and meaningful experience.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;As the world enters the 21st century, two of the biggest issues that have caught the attention of governments and citizens alike are environmental protection and economic developments. Both of these issues are of paramount importance as they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, in my opinion, tackling environmental problems should take precedence over economic developments.Environmental protection and economic developments are intertwined, yet they often find themselves at odds with each other. On one hand, economic developments bring about growth, jobs, and improved living standards. On the other hand, environmental protection ensures the conservation of natural resources, reduction of pollution, and mitigation of climate change. While economic developments are crucial for a country's progress, I firmly believe that environmental protection should be the priority.The reason for this is simple: a healthy environment is the foundation upon which all economic activity is built. Without a stable and thriving ecosystem, pollution, climate change, and loss of biodiversity can have devastating consequences on human health, food security, and ultimately, the economy. For instance, the cost of mitigating the effects of climate change far outweighs the cost of preventing it. Moreover, environmental degradation can lead to loss of natural resources, which can have long-term detrimental effects on a country's economic growth.In conclusion, while both environmental protection and economic developments are crucial, I strongly believe that governments should focus their budget more on environmental protection. By doing so, they can ensure a sustainable future for their citizens, prevent environmental disasters, and create a solid foundation for economic growth. It is time for governments to recognize the importance of environmental protection and take proactive measures to safeguard the planet for future generations. Only then can we ensure a prosperous and sustainable future for all.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;"The statement ""In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"" has sparked a heated debate among individuals. Some people believe that since environmental concern has risen, the use of cars will decrease. They argue that the growing awareness of climate change, air pollution, and other ecological issues will lead people to abandon their personal vehicles in favor of more sustainable modes of transportation. On the other hand, others think that a personal car is essential for one's daily life, providing convenience, flexibility, and independence.As far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea that there will be a decrease in car usage in the future. With the increasing concern for the environment, governments and companies are investing heavily in alternative modes of transportation, such as electric vehicles, public transport, and bike-sharing systems. Additionally, the rise of ride-hailing services and car-sharing platforms is reducing the need for personal car ownership. Many cities are also implementing initiatives to reduce traffic congestion and promote walking and cycling, making it easier for people to opt for car-free transportation.Furthermore, the cost of owning and maintaining a car is becoming increasingly expensive, with rising fuel prices, parking fees, and maintenance costs. As a result, many people, especially in urban areas, are choosing to rely on public transportation or alternative modes of transport. In conclusion, considering the growing environmental awareness, advancements in alternative transportation, and increasing costs of car ownership, I firmly believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today."
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;"I disagree with the statement that it's not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations. While it is true that in university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning, which may lead some students to believe that they don't need to attend classes as long as they can handle the exams. However, this perspective overlooks the significance of attending classes in the learning process.In terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone. Classes provide students with the opportunity to engage with instructors, ask questions, and participate in discussions, which can deepen their understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, attending classes exposes students to different perspectives, ideas, and experiences that they may not encounter through solo studying. This interactive and dynamic environment fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, all of which are essential for academic and professional success.Furthermore, attending class is not just about passing exams; it's about the holistic learning experience that universities aim to provide. It's also a matter of students' basic responsibility to attend class, as it demonstrates respect for the educational opportunity they have been given and for the instructors who have prepared to teach and guide them. By attending classes, students not only gain academic knowledge but also develop important life skills such as time management, discipline, and teamwork.In conclusion, while some students may feel that they can manage without attending classes, the benefits of attending classes far outweigh the perceived convenience of studying alone. Attending classes is an integral part of the university learning experience, contributing to academic achievement, personal growth, and professional development. Therefore, I firmly believe that attending class is a necessary component of university education, regardless of one's ability to pass examinations."
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The quotation ""When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success"" has sparked a debate about the role of luck in achieving success. Some people think that luck is the cause of a lot of success, but to be frank, I cannot agree with them. In my opinion, hard work and dedication are the primary drivers of success, while luck plays a minimal role.To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people, not lucky people. They have put in countless hours of effort and perseverance to reach the pinnacle of their careers. For instance, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is often quoted as saying ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This exemplifies the hard work and determination that is required to achieve greatness. These individuals are not simply lucky; they have worked tirelessly to hone their skills and talents.Besides, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. Relying on luck is unpredictable and unreliable, and it can lead to complacency and a lack of motivation. Hard work, on the other hand, provides a sense of control and agency over one's success. When individuals work hard, they are more likely to develop the skills, knowledge, and resilience needed to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. Furthermore, hard work fosters a growth mindset, enabling individuals to learn from their failures and use them as opportunities for growth.In conclusion, while luck may play a small role in success, it is hard work and dedication that ultimately lead to achievement. Famous people and successful individuals are a testament to the power of hard work, and it is essential to recognize and emulate their efforts rather than relying on luck. By adopting a strong work ethic and persevering through challenges, we can increase our chances of success and create a brighter future for ourselves."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The debate about whether one can learn better with or without a teacher has been ongoing for a long time. While some people believe that self-study is the most effective way to learn, others argue that having a teacher is essential for optimal learning. In my opinion, I prefer learning with a teacher, as it offers numerous benefits that can enhance the learning experience.Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. A teacher can provide clear explanations, clarify doubts, and offer personalized guidance, which can help learners to grasp complex concepts more easily. Moreover, a teacher can also provide feedback and assessment, which can help learners to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and make adjustments accordingly. This can lead to a more efficient and effective learning process.On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learn on my own, as it allows me to learn at my own pace and explore topics that interest me the most. Self-study can also foster independence, self-motivation, and critical thinking skills, which are essential for lifelong learning. However, without a teacher, I may struggle to stay on track, and may not have access to the same level of resources and support.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. They can break down complex information into manageable chunks, provide real-life examples, and offer valuable insights that can make learning more engaging and fun. Additionally, a teacher can also provide emotional support, encouragement, and motivation, which can help learners to overcome obstacles, build confidence, and develop a growth mindset. Overall, while I acknowledge the benefits of self-study, I believe that learning with a teacher offers numerous advantages that can enhance the learning experience, increase understanding, and promote academic success.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The statement suggests that working from home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a company's office using the same equipment. However, I disagree with this statement. With the advancement of technology, people can do their work anywhere as long as they have the necessary equipment around them. This flexibility has led many to believe that working from home is the more desirable option. Nevertheless, in my opinion, working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.One of the primary drawbacks of working from home is the lack of direct communication and interaction with colleagues and superiors. People who work at home are more likely to miss important events happening in the office, such as announcements from the boss, team meetings, and training sessions. These events are crucial for staying updated on company policies, goals, and expectations. Moreover, working in an office environment provides opportunities for face-to-face interactions, which can lead to better collaboration, innovation, and problem-solving.In contrast, working from home can lead to isolation and disconnection from the rest of the team. It can also be distracting, with personal and family responsibilities competing for attention. While some may argue that working from home provides a better work-life balance, I believe that the structure and discipline of an office environment are essential for maintaining productivity and meeting deadlines. In conclusion, although technology has made it possible to work from anywhere, I believe that working in a company's office is still the more effective and efficient option.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;The statement that in order to succeed, one should be more like others than be different from everyone else is a topic of debate. While some may argue that blending in with the crowd is the key to success, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, being different from everyone else is often a hallmark of achievement and innovation.Being different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior to others. It takes courage and creativity to stand out from the crowd and challenge conventional norms. When you dare to be different, you are often pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and this is where true success lies. By being unique, you are not limited by the constraints of what others think is achievable.Moreover, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. When you have a distinct perspective or approach, you are able to offer something that no one else can. This is what sets you apart and makes you valuable. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company, Apple, for example. Apple's success can be attributed to its willingness to be different and think outside the box. By introducing innovative and sleek products, Apple has created a brand that is synonymous with excellence and style. If Apple had simply followed the crowd, it would not be the leader in the technology industry that it is today.In conclusion, being different from everyone else is not a hindrance to success, but rather a key to unlocking it. By embracing your uniqueness and refusing to blend in with the crowd, you can achieve greatness and create value that is truly yours. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement and believe that being different is what sets the truly successful apart.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;I disagree with the statement that the personal and work-related challenges faced by young people today are not different from those faced by their parents and grandparents when they were young. In fact, I believe that the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation. Firstly, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges are getting more complicated and challenging. The modern job market is highly competitive, with companies operating on a global scale, and the rise of automation and artificial intelligence is changing the nature of work. As a result, young people today need to possess a unique set of skills, including digital literacy, adaptability, and creativity, in order to remain relevant in the workforce. This is a far cry from the relatively stable and predictable work environment experienced by their parents and grandparents.Secondly, this generation is encountering the issue of self-recognition, which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The proliferation of social media has created unrealistic expectations and promotes consumerism, making it difficult for young people to develop a clear sense of identity and purpose. The constant bombardment of information and the pressure to present a perfect online persona can lead to anxiety, depression, and feelings of inadequacy. This is a uniquely modern challenge that was not faced by previous generations, who did not have to navigate the complexities of online life.In conclusion, the challenges faced by young people today are distinct from those faced by their parents and grandparents. The changing nature of work and the impact of social media on self-recognition are just two examples of the ways in which the experiences of young people today are different from those of previous generations. As such, it is essential to acknowledge and address these challenges in a way that is tailored to the unique needs and experiences of young people today.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;The question of what makes people successful has been debated by many, and there are numerous viewpoints regarding the main characteristics of successful individuals. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. One of the primary reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. By venturing out of their comfort zones, they gain unique experiences, and exposure to diverse perspectives, which can significantly enhance their skills and knowledge.I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. History is filled with examples of successful individuals who achieved greatness by taking bold risks. For instance, entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, who revolutionized their respective industries by introducing innovative products and services. Their willingness to take risks and try new things enabled them to stay ahead of the curve and achieve unparalleled success. Moreover, trying new things and taking risks allows successful people to develop resilience, adaptability, and creative problem-solving skills, which are essential for overcoming obstacles and achieving their goals.In conclusion, trying new things and taking risks is a crucial aspect of achieving success. It enables individuals to learn valuable lessons, and gain experiences that can propel them to greatness. While it is true that playing it safe can provide a sense of security, it is the willingness to take risks and try new things that often separates the successful from the ordinary. Therefore, I firmly believe that successful people must be willing to step out of their comfort zones and take bold risks to achieve true success.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;The statement that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school for success in a future job has sparked a heated debate. While some people agree with this notion, others disagree. In my opinion, I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job. Studying hard provides a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, which are essential for any profession. On the other hand, relating well to people enables individuals to build strong relationships, collaborate effectively, and communicate their ideas clearly.One of the other factors that contribute to success is effective communication. By relating well with people, we are likely to have a wide network of communication, which is vital in any workplace. When we can communicate effectively with our colleagues, clients, and superiors, we can convey our ideas, negotiate, and resolve conflicts in a professional manner. This, in turn, enhances our productivity, job satisfaction, and overall career advancement. Furthermore, relating well to people also helps to build trust, credibility, and a strong reputation, all of which are essential for career growth and success.In conclusion, while studying hard in school provides the necessary knowledge and skills, relating well to people and effective communication are equally important for success in a future job. By combining these skills, individuals can build a strong foundation for their careers, establish a network of contacts, and communicate their ideas effectively. Therefore, I strongly believe that both are crucial, and it is not a question of which one is more important, but rather how to balance and combine them to achieve success in a future job.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;The statement that advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits has sparked a heated debate in recent years. Advertising is undoubtedly becoming an integral part of our modern society, influencing people's choices in various aspects of life, including the food they consume. However, the notion that advertising is the primary culprit behind unhealthy eating habits is a notion I disagree with.In my opinion, advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits. While it is true that advertisements for junk food and sugary drinks can be enticing, the ultimate decision to consume such products lies with the individual. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in the concept of wholesome diets and self-control. People need to be educated about the importance of balanced diets and have the willpower to make informed choices about the food they eat.Moreover, advertising can also have a positive impact on eating habits. With the growing awareness of the importance of living a healthy lifestyle, many companies are now advertising nutritious food options and promoting healthy eating habits. This shift in advertising strategy can lead to healthier eating habits, as people are exposed to more options and encouraged to make better choices. Therefore, rather than being the main cause of unhealthy eating habits, advertising can be a useful tool in promoting healthier lifestyles. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle, and to exercise self-control in the face of tempting advertisements.
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";I disagree with the statement that television has destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is true that excessive television watching can have negative effects on interpersonal relationships, I believe that television itself is a valuable tool that can also bring people together and provide a platform for discussion.Television is a great tool to learn, entertain, and inform us about what is happening around the world. Through documentaries, news programs, and educational shows, we can gain a deeper understanding of various topics and stay up-to-date on current events. However, it is also true that television has some negative effects among some people. Some individuals spend a significant amount of time watching television, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and social isolation. Others even eat while watching television, which can lead to unhealthy eating habits and a lack of quality time spent with family and friends.Despite these negative effects, I do not think that television is the primary cause of destroyed communication among friends and family. In fact, many television shows and programs are designed to be watched and discussed with others, such as sports events, awards shows, and popular series. These shared viewing experiences can actually bring people together and provide a common topic of conversation. Furthermore, television can also provide a platform for families to bond over shared interests and discuss important issues. Ultimately, I believe that television is a tool that can be used positively or negatively, and it is up to individuals to use it in a way that promotes healthy communication and relationships.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The statement that sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support at universities and colleges is a topic of debate. While it is true that university students can be divided into two groups, one with less interest in studying and the other comprising hardworking students, I believe that the allocation of financial resources should prioritize academic pursuits.On one hand, it is undeniable that engaging in sports and social activities is essential for a healthy and happy life. Doing exercise for at least 30 minutes a day can significantly improve physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, social activities can foster teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills, which are valuable in both personal and professional life. However, these activities should complement, rather than compete with, academic pursuits.On the other hand, I disagree that equal financial support should be allocated to sports and social activities as to classes and libraries. Academic infrastructure, such as libraries and laboratories, forms the foundation of a university education. These facilities provide students with access to resources, equipment, and expertise that are crucial for their academic development and future career prospects. Hardworking students, who are the backbone of any academic institution, rely heavily on these facilities to achieve their academic goals.In conclusion, while sports and social activities are important for the overall development of university students, I do not think that they should receive equal financial support as academic facilities. The primary purpose of a university is to provide academic education, and therefore, financial resources should be allocated accordingly. Nevertheless, a balanced approach that acknowledges the value of both academic and extracurricular activities is essential for creating a well-rounded university experience.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that attending classes should be optional, I firmly believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Attending classes has a plethora of benefits for students, providing them with a wide range of learning opportunities. Firstly, being present in class provides students with the opportunity to communicate with their peers, which is beneficial for understanding new material. By reviewing and discussing course content with classmates during free time, students can clarify any doubts and gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, attending classes allows students to seek help from their instructors and peers when faced with difficult problems, which is essential for academic success. Moreover, attending classes makes students more accountable and motivated to keep up with the coursework. When students are required to attend classes, they are more likely to stay on top of their assignments and participate in class discussions, leading to a more engaging and effective learning experience. In contrast, not attending classes can lead to falling behind in coursework and missing out on valuable learning opportunities. In conclusion, while some may argue that attending classes should be optional, I strongly believe that requiring university students to attend classes is the wiser option. The benefits of attending classes, including enhanced communication with peers, access to help when needed, and increased accountability, make it an essential part of the university experience. By attending classes, students can take full advantage of the learning opportunities available to them, leading to a more successful and fulfilling academic journey.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;I disagree with the statement that telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. In fact, I believe that these technological advancements have made my life easier and enhanced my ability to connect with others. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.Firstly, telephones and email allow me to talk or write directly to the people I want to connect with, regardless of their geographical location. This has opened up a world of possibilities, enabling me to communicate with friends, family, and colleagues who are scattered across the globe. With just a few clicks or a phone call, I can reach out to anyone I want to, making it easier to maintain relationships and build new ones.Secondly, I find that telephones and email enable me to express some important words better than face-to-face communication. Sometimes, putting thoughts and feelings into words can be challenging, especially when dealing with sensitive or complex topics. Email, in particular, gives me the time and space to gather my thoughts and articulate them clearly, ensuring that my message is conveyed accurately. Similarly, phone calls allow me to have real-time conversations, which can be more effective than in-person discussions, especially when discussing delicate matters.Overall, telephones and email have revolutionized the way we communicate, making it faster, more convenient, and more effective. Rather than making communication less personal, I believe that these tools have enabled me to connect with others in a more efficient and meaningful way, ultimately enriching my relationships and expanding my social circle.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, some people prefer the tranquility of a small town, while others opt for the hustle and bustle of a big city. As for me, I would definitely prefer to live in a big city. One of the main reasons for this preference is the abundance of social places that big cities offer. Unlike small towns, where options are limited to maybe one bar or one cinema, big cities are equipped with a wide range of restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, and theaters. This diversity of social spots provides endless opportunities to meet new people, interact with friends, and enjoy various forms of entertainment.Another significant advantage of living in a big city is the access to advanced medical technologies. Big cities are typically hubs for cutting-edge medical research and treatment facilities, offering the latest in medical care. This aspect, in my opinion, outweighs the potential negative influences of city life, such as pollution and noise. The availability of top-notch medical facilities ensures that residents have the best possible healthcare options, which is a critical factor in overall quality of life.In contrast, small towns often lack the sophistication and amenities that big cities provide. While they may offer a closer-knit community and a more relaxed pace of life, the limitations in social and medical facilities make them less appealing to me. The benefits of living in a big city, including the vibrant social scene and superior medical technologies, make it the preferable choice for someone like me who values diversity, convenience, and access to the best services. Overall, the allure of big city life, with its endless possibilities and advancements, makes it the place I would choose to call home.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;When it comes to the debate about whether to stick to what one already does well or to try new things and take risks, I firmly believe that focusing on what I am good at is the preferred approach. While some people may love to try new things and take risks, even if they aren't good at them, I think that concentrating on my strengths will ultimately lead to greater success.By focusing on what I do well, I can attain my goals more efficiently. The more time I spend on what I excel at, the more likely I am to achieve something great. For instance, if I'm a skilled writer, spending most of my time honing my writing skills will increase my chances of becoming a published author. In contrast, trying new things and taking risks may lead to a broader range of experiences, but it may also lead to a lack of depth and mastery in any one area.Additionally, specializing in what I'm good at allows me to build on my existing knowledge and skills, which can lead to expertise and recognition in my field. This, in turn, can open up new opportunities and increase my confidence. While trying new things can be exciting and enriching, I believe that it's more important to focus on what I do well, as this will ultimately lead to greater achievement and fulfillment. Therefore, I prefer to concentrate on my strengths, as I believe that this is the key to unlocking my full potential and achieving my goals. By doing so, I can make the most of my talents and make a meaningful impact in my chosen field.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;The debate about when children should learn to manage their own money has sparked intense discussion among parents and educators. Many people argue about whether children should learn financial responsibility at a young age or wait until adulthood. I am a firm believer that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, and for good reason.Learning to manage money at a young age provides children with essential life skills that will benefit them in the long run. By introducing basic financial concepts such as saving, spending, and budgeting, children can develop healthy financial habits that will stay with them throughout their lives. Moreover, early exposure to money management can help children understand the value of money, develop a sense of responsibility, and make informed decisions about how to allocate their resources.Furthermore, learning to manage money at a young age can also help children avoid common financial pitfalls such as debt and overspending. By teaching children the importance of saving and budgeting, parents can help them develop a sense of financial discipline and responsibility. This, in turn, can help children make smart financial decisions and achieve their long-term goals, such as pursuing higher education or starting their own business.In conclusion, the earlier children learn to manage their own money, the better equipped they will be to navigate the complexities of adulthood. By teaching children essential financial skills at a young age, parents can set them up for a lifetime of financial responsibility and success. As such, I strongly agree that children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, and I believe that this is an essential step in raising financially responsible adults.

Whether it's a traditional folk dance or a modern style, dancing brings people together and provides a sense of community and joy.Dancing is also an important part of a culture that represents the beliefs and values of its people.

276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;"The statement ""it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts"" has sparked numerous debates among educators and scholars. However, I am convinced that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. While understanding ideas and concepts is undoubtedly crucial, I firmly believe that acquiring factual knowledge is equally, if not more, important.Firstly, when students learn facts in school, they are better equipped to face problems in their own lives. Factual knowledge provides a foundation for critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By memorizing and understanding facts, students develop a solid base of information that enables them to analyze situations, make informed decisions, and tackle challenges with confidence. This, in turn, prepares them for the complexities of real-life situations, where having a wealth of factual knowledge can be a valuable asset.Secondly, learning facts can improve students' social behavior. When students are well-versed in factual knowledge, they are more likely to engage in meaningful conversations, participate in discussions, and demonstrate respect for others' opinions. This, in turn, fosters a sense of community and social responsibility, as students become more aware of the world around them and are able to contribute to it in a more informed and thoughtful manner. Moreover, having a strong foundation in factual knowledge can also promote cultural and historical awareness, allowing students to appreciate and respect diverse perspectives and traditions.In conclusion, while understanding ideas and concepts is essential, I firmly believe that learning facts has numerous advantages for students' future lives. By acquiring a strong foundation in factual knowledge, students can develop problem-solving skills, improve their social behavior, and become more informed and engaged members of society. Therefore, I disagree with the statement, and argue that learning facts is equally, if not more, important than understanding ideas and concepts."
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The importance of sports and social activities in universities and colleges has been a topic of debate for a long time. While some argue that classes and libraries are the primary focus of academic institutions, I strongly agree that sports and social activities are just as important and should receive equal financial support. In my viewpoint,Sports have very vital effects on human healthfulness. Not only do they help maintain a good body shape, but they are also necessary for students to acquire energy and overall health. Regular physical activity has been proven to improve mental health,,assistantThe importance of sports and social activities in universities and colleges has been a topic of debate for a long time.

Regular physical activity has been proven to improve mental health, boost mood, and enhance cognitive function, ultimately leading to better academic performance.In addition to the physical benefits, social activities also play a significant role in the university experience. They provide students with opportunities to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds, fostering a deeper understanding of different cultures and perspectives. Social activities, such as club meetings, volunteer work, and cultural events, help students become familiar with others' minds and adapt to various environments. These experiences not only broaden students' horizons but also equip them with essential life skills like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Furthermore, social activities bring about a sense of community and belonging, which is essential for students' emotional well-being and overall satisfaction with their university experience. They also provide a much-needed break from academic pressures, offering students a chance to have fun and entertainment, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.In conclusion, given the numerous benefits of sports and social activities, I firmly believe that they should receive equal financial support as classes and libraries. By investing in these areas, universities and colleges can promote the overall development of their students, leading to a more well-rounded, healthy, and happy student body.

Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet is considered one of the most important inventions over the past century, and its impact on our lives is undeniable. While some people believe that several problems occur from the information available on the internet, in my opinion, I agree with the view that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. The internet gives us daily necessary information, which helps us stay updated about current events, news, and trends. For instance, we can access news articles, weather forecasts, and traffic updates with just a few clicks. This readily available information enables us to make informed decisions and plan our daily lives more efficiently.

Online libraries, educational websites, and tutorials offer a wealth of information that can be accessed from anywhere, at any time.Moreover, the internet enables us to explore the world without physical boundaries. We can learn about different cultures, histories, and geographical locations, broadening our perspectives and fostering global understanding. Social media platforms and online forums also facilitate connections with people from diverse backgrounds, promoting exchange of ideas and experiences.

The internet's ability to provide valuable information, facilitate knowledge acquisition, and promote global exploration makes it an indispensable tool in our daily lives. By harnessing its potential, we can unlock new opportunities, enhance our understanding of the world, and improve our overall quality of life.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The university is a place that provides people with the knowledge and skills to use in their real life. It is an institution that equips students with the necessary tools to succeed in their future careers. When it comes to the structure of university programs, there are two main approaches: requiring students to take classes in many subjects or specializing in one subject. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better than one.Some universities require students to study in one subject, which can limit their exposure to other fields of interest. On the other hand, studying many subjects allows students to explore various disciplines and gain a broader understanding of the world. This approach is beneficial because students can study subjects that they are interested in, thereby fostering a deeper passion for learning. By studying multiple subjects, students can gain knowledge in more than one field, which can lead to a more well-rounded education.Furthermore, studying many subjects provides students with more chances to choose their future career paths. With a broader range of knowledge, students can make more informed decisions about their career goals and are more likely to find a field that truly suits their interests and skills. In contrast, specializing in one subject may limit a student's career options and make it more difficult for them to adapt to changing job markets. Therefore, I firmly believe that studying many subjects is better than specializing in one, as it provides students with a more comprehensive education, greater flexibility, and a wider range of career opportunities.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;The debate on whether governments should prioritize exploring outer space or focus on fulfilling the basic needs of their citizens has sparked intense discussion. In my opinion, government should pay attention to the basic needs of people first. The fundamental requirements for a decent life, including jobs, a good environment, and love in family, are essential for the well-being and happiness of individuals.While space exploration can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and advancements in technology, I firmly believe that these ambitions should not come at the expense of the basic necessities of life. Providing jobs, ensuring a clean and healthy environment, and supporting family structures are the building blocks of a stable and prosperous society. Without these foundations, individuals cannot thrive, and the overall quality of life deteriorates.Furthermore, investing in the basic needs of citizens has a direct and immediate impact on their lives. Creating job opportunities helps reduce poverty and increases economic stability. Preserving a good environment ensures the health and safety of communities. Nurturing love in families fosters a supportive and caring society. In contrast, the benefits of space exploration, although significant, are often long-term and may not directly address the pressing issues faced by everyday people.Therefore, governments should allocate their resources towards meeting the basic needs of their citizens before venturing into costly space exploration projects. By doing so, they can create a strong, happy, and secure society that can then support and benefit from the advancements brought about by space research. In conclusion, the welfare of citizens should always be the top priority for governments, and only when these basic needs are met should they consider exploring the vastness of outer space.

So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me.

Research has shown that calming music can lower blood pressure, heart rate, and stress hormones, creating a sense of relaxation and calmness.

By focusing on the present moment and letting go of thoughts, meditation helps calm the mind and reduce feelings of overwhelm. Regular meditation practice can lead to a significant decrease in stress levels, improved sleep, and increased productivity.

They are accessible, easy to practice, and require minimal equipment or expertise. By incorporating these activities into our daily lives, we can better manage the challenges of modern life and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;I strongly disagree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. The main task of teachers in schools is to impart knowledge to students, and this role must be completed within a limited timeframe. Given the time constraints, it is unrealistic to expect teachers to devote individualized attention to each student in a class. Moreover, the learning abilities of students vary significantly, making it unfair to judge a teacher's effectiveness based on the test results of their students.In a typical classroom setting, teachers have to cater to a diverse group of students with different learning capacities, strengths, and weaknesses. Some students may grasp concepts quickly, while others may require more time and support. It is not feasible for teachers to provide personalized instruction to each student, especially when dealing with large class sizes. As a result, some students may excel, while others may struggle, regardless of the teacher's efforts.Paying teachers based on student test results would be an unjust and unreliable measure of their performance. It would create undue stress on both teachers and students, leading to a narrow focus on test preparation rather than holistic learning. Furthermore, this approach would undermine the intrinsic motivation of teachers to educate and inspire, rather than merely focusing on achieving high test scores.Instead, teachers should be evaluated based on their dedication, professionalism, and commitment to creating an engaging and inclusive learning environment. This would allow them to focus on their core responsibility of imparting knowledge, without being unduly pressured by performance metrics that do not accurately reflect their worth as educators. Ultimately, a fair and equitable compensation system for teachers is essential to maintain the integrity and quality of education.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The statement that movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished has sparked a debate among many. While it is true that traditionally, movies and dramas usually have a happy ending where the good characters are rewarded and the bad ones are punished, this narrative can be misleading. I disagree with the statement because I believe that it is not always realistic or beneficial to portray good people as always receiving a happy ending.In many films and TV shows, the good characters are indeed rewarded, and the bad ones face consequences for their actions. This can be seen in countless fairy tales, children's movies, and even some adult dramas. However, if good people always receive a happy ending, I don't think it's proper. Real life does not always work this way. Sometimes, good people can face unfortunate circumstances or bad endings despite their good intentions and actions. It is essential to portray a more realistic view of life in media, especially when it comes to children's content. Young children who watch these shows may develop unrealistic expectations about how the world works. They may believe that simply being good will always lead to a happy ending, which can be disappointing and confusing when they encounter real-life situations that do not follow this pattern. Therefore, it is crucial to tell children that, even in real life, good people can sometimes experience bad endings. This can help them develop a more nuanced understanding of the world and prepare them for the complexities and challenges of life. By presenting a more balanced and realistic portrayal of life, movies and television programs can provide a more valuable and lasting lesson for their young audiences.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The notion that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning has gained significant attention in recent years. While there are many advantages of distance learning, such as flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, I strongly believe that it should not replace traditional classroom learning. Consequently, I completely disagree with the statement that we should replace normal courses with online courses.There are several reasons that support my opinion. Firstly, classroom learning provides students with a more interactive and engaging experience, allowing them to ask questions, participate in discussions, and receive immediate feedback from instructors. This face-to-face interaction is essential for building relationships, developing communication skills, and fostering a sense of community among students. In contrast, online learning can often feel isolating and lacking in personal connection.Another significant advantage of classroom learning is the ability to conduct hands-on experiments, labs, and other practical activities that are difficult to replicate in an online setting. Many subjects, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), require hands-on experience and experimentation to fully understand complex concepts. Moreover, classroom learning allows instructors to tailor their teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of their students, including those with special needs or language barriers.In conclusion, while distance learning has its benefits, it is not a replacement for traditional classroom learning. The unique benefits of face-to-face interaction, hands-on experience, and personalized instruction make classroom learning an essential part of the educational experience. Rather than replacing classroom learning, distance learning should be seen as a complementary tool to enhance and support traditional teaching methods. By combining the strengths of both approaches, we can create a more effective, engaging, and inclusive learning environment for students.

There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;The experiences that I have accumulated over the years have significantly shaped my outlook and the way I live now. Many circumstances that I have encountered have changed the way I think, allowing me to grow and develop as a person. For instance, studying in university was a pivotal experience that taught me to be a more prudent person when it comes to solving problems. The academic rigor and independence that came with university life forced me to think critically and approach challenges in a logical and methodical manner.This experience has had a lasting impact on my life, as I now approach problems with a clear and level head, considering all possible solutions before making a decision. Besides academic experiences, other events have also played a crucial role in shaping my outlook. For example, some experiences have taught me the importance of taking care of myself, both physically and mentally. I have learned to prioritize my well-being, to recognize when I need to take a step back and recharge, and to seek help when I need it.These experiences have collectively contributed to my growth and development, allowing me to become a more resilient, self-sufficient, and thoughtful person. I have learned to navigate complex situations, to adapt to new environments, and to cultivate meaningful relationships. Moreover, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself and my place in the world, which has given me a sense of purpose and direction. In conclusion, the experiences that I have had have profoundly shaped my outlook and the way I live now, teaching me valuable lessons about problem-solving, self-care, and personal growth.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;In today's globalized world, learning a foreign language has become more and more important. As a result, many people pursue studying a foreign language to enhance their career opportunities and broaden their cultural understanding. When it comes to learning a foreign language, there are two common approaches: learning in one's own country or learning in the country where the language is spoken. In my opinion, going to another place to learn a language is the better choice.Learning a language in the country where it is spoken offers an immersive experience that cannot be replicated in one's own country. By surrounding oneself with native speakers, one can pick up the nuances of the language, including pronunciation, idioms, and colloquialisms. Moreover, being in the country allows learners to practice their language skills in real-life situations, such as ordering food, shopping, and interacting with locals. This hands-on experience helps to build confidence and fluency in the language.In contrast, learning a language in one's own country can be a more isolating experience. While language classes and textbooks can provide a solid foundation, they often lack the authenticity and spontaneity of learning in the target language country. Furthermore, learners may not have as many opportunities to practice their language skills in everyday situations. Therefore, I firmly believe that going to another place to learn a language is the better choice. Not only does it provide an immersive experience, but it also offers a unique opportunity to experience the culture and customs of the target language country. By doing so, learners can gain a deeper understanding of the language and its context, which is essential for effective communication.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could change one important thing about my hometown, I would undoubtedly choose to enhance the public transportation system. When it comes to deciding where to live, the primary factors that we consider are public utilities and surroundings. My hometown is well-equipped with almost all the necessary public utilities, catering to one's basic needs. However, there is a notable exception - transportation. The lack of a comprehensive public transportation network is a significant drawback, making daily commutes and travel within the town cumbersome and inconvenient.The absence of a reliable and efficient public transportation system affects not only residents but also the local economy. Many people rely on personal vehicles, which contribute to traffic congestion, air pollution, and the high costs associated with vehicle maintenance. Furthermore, the limited public transportation options available are often overcrowded and infrequent, making them an unattractive choice for many. For instance, students and workers who cannot afford private vehicles are left with no choice but to use these inadequate services, wasting valuable time and energy in the process.Therefore, introducing more public transportation in my community would be a game-changer. It would not only ease the daily commute for residents but also attract more businesses and visitors, boosting the local economy. A well-planned public transportation system, including buses, trains, or even bike-sharing services, would significantly improve the quality of life for everyone. It would reduce traffic, decrease pollution, and make the town a more appealing place to live and visit. In conclusion, enhancing public transportation is the one important thing I would change about my hometown, aiming to make it a more livable, sustainable, and connected community for all its residents.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The question of whether schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers has sparked intense debate in recent years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that schools should solicit feedback from students regarding their teachers' performance. Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance, and evaluating teachers from students is one of the ways to improve the quality of the educational system.By gathering feedback from students, schools can gain valuable insights into the teaching methods and effectiveness of their instructors. This information can be used to identify areas where teachers may need additional training or support,. As a result, not only can teachers improve their performance, but the whole education system can also improve its performance from the evaluation made by students. For instance, if a student's feedback highlights a particular teacher's inability to explain complex concepts clearly, the school can provide that teacher with additional resources or professional development opportunities to enhance their teaching skills.Furthermore, student evaluations can help schools to recognize and reward outstanding teachers,. By acknowledging and rewarding exceptional teaching, schools can foster a culture of excellence and encourage teachers to strive for continuous improvement. Ultimately, this can lead to a better learning experience for students and improved academic outcomes. In conclusion, the benefits of student evaluations far outweigh any potential drawbacks, and I firmly believe that schools should solicit feedback from students to evaluate their teachers. By doing so, schools can create a more effective and responsive education system that truly meets the needs of its students.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;When it comes to choosing between working for a large company and a small company, the decision can be a difficult one. Some people may prefer the intimacy and personalized approach of a small company, often with a local presence in the area. On the other hand, large companies operate on an international scale, providing goods and services not just to the entire nation but also to foreign countries. Personally, I prefer to work for a large company, and my preference is based on several compelling reasons.Firstly, finding a job in a large company is significantly easier compared to a small company. Large corporations typically have more positions available, and their recruitment processes are often more streamlined and widely advertised. This accessibility is a major advantage for job seekers, as it increases the likelihood of securing employment.Secondly, larger companies are generally in a better position to offer more competitive salaries and benefits packages compared to smaller ones. The financial resources and scale of operations in large companies allow for more generous compensation for their employees, which is an important consideration for anyone looking to advance their career and improve their standard of living.Lastly, I have always been passionate about traveling and exploring different cultures around the world. Working for a large company, which often has an international presence, would provide me with the perfect opportunity to travel for work, experience new environments, and contribute to global operations. This aspect of working for a large company aligns with my personal interests and career aspirations, making it an even more appealing choice.In conclusion, while small companies have their unique advantages, my preference for working with a large company is driven by the ease of job acquisition, the potential for better salaries, and the opportunity for international travel and work experience. These factors not only enhance my career prospects but also fulfill my personal desires for exploration and cultural exchange.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;"The debate surrounding the accessibility of higher education has sparked intense discussion among individuals. Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students, regardless of their academic background. On the other hand, there are those who think that higher education should be reserved only for good students. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the view that college and university education should be available to all students.It is undeniable that colleges and universities play a vital role in providing academic skills to people, enabling them to pursue their goals and dreams. These institutions offer a platform for individuals to acquire advanced skills, knowledge, and expertise in their chosen field. Some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students, as they believe that only those who excel academically deserve to reap the benefits of higher education. However, I disagree with this notion. I think that everyone should have the chance to gain these advanced skills, regardless of their academic performance.Denying access to higher education to those who may not be considered ""good"" students could have severe consequences, such as limiting their potential and hindering their personal and professional growth. Moreover, colleges and universities can provide support and resources to help underperforming students improve their academic skills, allowing them to reach their full potential. By making higher education available to all, we can foster a more inclusive and equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and contribute to their community. Ultimately, I firmly believe that higher education should be accessible to all students, as it is essential for personal and societal development."
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The rise of online computer games has led to a growing concern among educators and parents alike. A large number of students are obsessed with online computer games, and as a result, their performance in school has significantly declined. Instead of focusing on their studies, many students spend hours on end playing games, neglecting their homework and other important responsibilities. This obsession not only hinders their academic progress but also affects their overall development.Moreover, children can learn nothing valuable from these computer games. The majority of these games use war, violence, blood, or sexual subjects to lure students, exposing them to inappropriate and harmful content. These games do not promote learning, critical thinking, or problem-solving skills, but rather encourage mindless entertainment and addiction. As a result, the time spent playing these games is indeed time-wasting, as it does not contribute to the student's intellectual or personal growth.Allowing students to play computer games can have severe consequences on their academic and personal well-being. It is essential for schools and parents to take a stance against excessive gaming and encourage students to engage in more productive and enriching activities. By doing so, students can focus on their studies, develop important life skills, and maintain a healthy balance between entertainment and education. In conclusion, playing computer games is a waste of time, and students should not be allowed to indulge in this activity excessively, as it can have detrimental effects on their academic performance and overall development.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;When it comes to collaborating on projects, the question arises whether classmates or colleagues should work in person or through emails. In my opinion, working in person is the more effective approach. By doing so, individuals can indirectly improve the quality and efficiency of the project. Face-to-face interactions allow team members to clarify any misunderstandings, address concerns, and build trust, ultimately leading to fewer conflicts and fights amongst the group.Research supports this notion, as an experiment conducted by Beijing University demonstrated that people can reach an agreement quickly when they engage in direct conversation. This is likely due to the ability to pick up on nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, which can convey just as much information as spoken words. In contrast, relying solely on emails can lead to miscommunications and delays, as the nuances of human interaction are lost in digital communication.Although emails are not the most convenient tool for collaborative work, they are certainly better than no communication at all. In situations where in-person meetings are not possible, emails can serve as a substitute. However, they should not be relied upon as the primary means of collaboration. When possible, working in person allows team members to capitalize on the benefits of face-to-face interaction, leading to more effective and efficient project outcomes. In conclusion, while emails have their place in collaborative work, working in person is the superior choice for producing high-quality results and fostering a harmonious team dynamic. By doing so, individuals can ensure that their project is completed to the best of their abilities, with minimal conflicts and maximum productivity.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The role of university professors has been a topic of debate in recent years. Some people believe that professors should focus more on educating students, while others think they should prioritize research. In my opinion, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research. More and more university professors are involved in scientific research, which has led to significant advancements in various fields. This trend has sparked concerns that the quality of education may decline as a result. Some are afraid that if professors are too focused on research, they may neglect their teaching responsibilities, leading to a decrease in the quality of education provided to students. However, according to my experiences, I strongly disagree with this view.In my experience, professors who are actively engaged in research are more enthusiastic and knowledgeable about their subject matter. They are able to share their latest findings and insights with students, making their lectures more engaging and relevant. Moreover, research-oriented professors are often more approachable and willing to guide students in their own research projects, which helps students develop valuable skills and knowledge. By prioritizing research, professors can stay updated with the latest developments in their field, which in turn, benefits their students.Furthermore, research and education are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they complement each other. Professors who conduct research are better equipped to provide high-quality education, as they are able to share their expertise and experiences with students. Therefore, I believe that professors should be encouraged to mainly do research, as it will ultimately benefit both the professors themselves and their students. By doing so, universities can foster a culture of innovation and academic excellence, which is essential for producing well-rounded and informed graduates.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The debate about whether one learns better by themselves or with a teacher has been ongoing for a long time. While some people prefer to learn independently, the benefits of learning with a teacher far outweigh those of solo learning, in my opinion. I firmly believe that I learn better with a teacher rather than learning by myself.Learning with a teacher provides numerous advantages, particularly when it comes to developing essential life skills such as cooperation and effective communication. When I learn with a teacher, I am not only acquiring knowledge, but I am also learning how to work with others, share ideas, and express my opinions in a constructive manner. This social aspect of learning is crucial, as it helps me develop into a well-rounded individual who can collaborate and interact with others seamlessly.On the other hand, I think that for one who depends solely on themselves in learning, their improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and expressing their opinion, is unpromising. Without the guidance and feedback of a teacher, an individual may struggle to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and may lack the opportunity to engage in discussions and debates that help refine their thoughts and ideas. Furthermore, learning alone can be isolating and may lead to a narrow and limited perspective, devoid of the diverse insights and experiences that a teacher and fellow students can provide.In conclusion, I prefer to learn with a teacher as it offers a more comprehensive and engaging learning experience. The benefits of social interaction, feedback, and guidance that a teacher provides are invaluable, and I believe that they are essential for personal growth and development. By learning with a teacher, I can acquire not only knowledge but also the skills and confidence to succeed in all aspects of life.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;The advent of technology has led many to believe that they are living in a blessed era, where life is made simpler and more efficient. However, a closer examination reveals that these advancements have, in fact, made our lives more complicated. Despite the initial intention of technology to simplify and streamline our daily routines, it has inadvertently introduced a plethora of complexities.There are several reasons that support this assertion. Firstly, the sheer volume of information available at our fingertips can be overwhelming. With the rise of social media, news outlets, and other digital platforms, we are constantly bombarded with notifications, updates, and alerts. This relentless flow of data can lead to mental fatigue, decreased attention span, and a sense of perpetual distraction. For instance, the average person checks their phone over 100 times a day, leading to a significant decrease in productivity and increase in stress levels.Another example is the complexity of modern gadgets and software. While designed to be user-friendly, these technologies often require a significant amount of time and effort to learn and master. The frequent updates and changes to these systems can also be frustrating, leading to feelings of anxiety and confusion. Furthermore, the reliance on technology has also created new problems, such as cybersecurity threats, data breaches, and the loss of traditional skills. In conclusion, the notion that technology simplifies our lives is a myth. In reality, it has introduced a multitude of complexities, making our lives more complicated than ever before. As we continue to navigate this digital landscape, it is essential to acknowledge these challenges and strive for a more balanced and simplified approach to technology.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The advent of distance-learning programs has revolutionized the way we approach education, offering flexibility and accessibility to a wider audience. However, the notion that these programs are inferior to traditional classroom learning is a topic of debate. In my opinion, I agree that classroom learning is superior to online classes, and I will elaborate on this stance.Classroom learning is, in my view, the best way to provide education. One of the primary advantages of traditional learning is the emphasis on completing study work on time. This structured approach fosters the development of impeccable time management skills, which are essential for success in any field. Students are required to meet deadlines, attend classes, and participate in discussions, all of which contribute to their ability to prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively.Furthermore, professors play a vital role in classroom learning, serving as mentors and guides who impart valuable information and insights to their students. The face-to-face interaction between instructors and students facilitates a deeper understanding of complex concepts, as professors can clarify doubts, provide feedback, and offer individualized attention. This personalized approach to learning is often lacking in online classes, where students may feel isolated and disconnected from their instructors.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs have their advantages, I firmly believe that classroom learning is the most effective way to provide education. The structured environment, emphasis on time management, and the invaluable role of professors all contribute to a more comprehensive and engaging learning experience. As such, I disagree with the idea that online classes can replace the benefits of traditional classroom learning.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The concept of teenagers having jobs while still being students is a topic of debate in many countries. Some people do not support this idea, citing concerns that it may interfere with their academic performance and hinder their social development. However, in my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part-time job while they are still a student.Having a part-time job can provide teenagers with valuable skills and experiences that complement their academic education. For instance, students can learn about time management, as they need to balance their work schedule with their study commitments. Additionally, they can develop money management skills, such as budgeting and saving, which are essential life skills. Moreover, part-time jobs often require students to interact with customers, colleagues, and supervisors, which can help them improve their communication skills and learn how to convince people with their words.Furthermore, part-time jobs can provide students with a source of income, which can help alleviate financial burdens on their parents. Many students use their earnings to contribute to their family's expenses, such as tuition fees, living costs, and other necessities. This not only helps their parents financially but also teaches students the value of money and the importance of financial independence. Overall, I believe that having a part-time job while being a student can be a rewarding and enriching experience for teenagers, providing them with essential life skills, financial support, and a sense of responsibility. Therefore, I strongly support the idea of teenagers having jobs while still being students.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;In today's globalized world, it has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one does interact with foreigners once in a lifetime. The question of where to learn a foreign language, in one's own country or in the country where it is spoken, has sparked a debate. While some argue that learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is more effective, I firmly believe that it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country.Learning a foreign language in one's own country has several advantages. Firstly, it is more convenient and cost-effective. Students can learn at their own pace, without having to worry about the expenses of traveling and living abroad. Moreover, learning a foreign language in one's own country provides access to qualified teachers and resources, such as language schools and libraries, which can provide structured lessons and materials. Additionally, learning a foreign language in one's own country allows students to learn the language in a more controlled environment, without the distractions and pressures of living in a foreign country.In contrast, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken can be overwhelming, especially for beginners. The language is everywhere, and students may feel pressured to speak the language fluently, which can lead to frustration and discouragement. Furthermore, living in a foreign country requires a significant amount of time and money, which can be a barrier for many people. Therefore, considering the convenience, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of resources, I believe that it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. This approach allows students to build a strong foundation in the language, which can then be reinforced through practice and interaction with native speakers.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate about whether students should have one long vacation or several short breaks throughout the year has sparked intense discussion. While many people promote the one long vacation system, arguing that it would help students start their course or academic year with a strong zeal for learning, I discern that several small breaks will help students remain active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep the stress level of students low. Prolonged periods of academic pressure can lead to burnout and decreased motivation. By providing regular breaks, the students can recharge, refocus, and return to their studies with renewed energy and enthusiasm. For instance, a study has shown that students who took regular breaks throughout the semester performed better academically and had lower stress levels compared to those who had a single long break.Moreover, these short vacations can also provide students with opportunities for experiential learning, where they can engage in activities that are not possible within the confines of a classroom. This can include internships, volunteer work, or cultural immersion programs, which can broaden their perspectives and enhance their learning experience. By incorporating these breaks into the academic calendar, students can gain valuable life skills, such as time management, independence, and self-directed learning.In conclusion, while the one long vacation system may have its benefits, I firmly believe that several short vacations throughout the year are more beneficial for students. By keeping stress levels low and providing opportunities for experiential learning, these breaks can help students remain active, engaged, and motivated throughout the academic year. Ultimately, this can lead to improved academic performance, increased student satisfaction, and a more well-rounded education.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" is a powerful mantra that emphasizes the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving one's goals. I strongly agree with this statement, as it has been proven to me through my own personal experience. At the age of nearly thirty, I won a medal, which was a significant milestone in my life. This achievement was not a result of luck or chance, but rather the culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and unwavering commitment to my goals.From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for their goals, as it is often the persistence and resilience that ultimately lead to success. Giving up too easily can result in missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. On the other hand, persistence and determination can help overcome even the most daunting obstacles and challenges. My own journey to winning a medal was not without its setbacks and failures, but it was the refusal to give up that ultimately led to my success.This experience has taught me that success is rarely instantaneous, and that it often requires a long-term effort and dedication. Therefore, I firmly believe that one should never give up on their goals, no matter how difficult or impossible they may seem. By embracing the ""Never, never give up"" mindset, individuals can unlock their full potential, overcome adversity, and achieve their aspirations. In conclusion, my personal experience has shown me the value of perseverance and determination, and I firmly believe that one should always keep trying and never stop working towards their goals."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The debate about whether to enjoy one's money immediately or save it for the future has been ongoing. In recent years, the majority of developed countries have witnessed a low saving rate, as people tend to spend their earnings immediately or even take loans to finance their expenses. However, I strongly believe that saving a portion of one's earnings is essential.In my opinion, setting aside some part of one's income is crucial due to the unpredictability of future developments. Life is full of uncertainties, and unexpected expenses can arise at any moment. By saving, individuals can create a financial safety net that can help them navigate through difficult times. For instance, saving can provide a cushion in case of job loss, medical emergencies, or other unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, saving can also enable individuals to achieve long-term goals, such as buying a house, funding their children's education, or enjoying a comfortable retirement.Furthermore, saving can also help individuals avoid debt traps. When people spend their earnings immediately or take loans to finance their expenses, they often end up accumulating debt. This can lead to a vicious cycle of debt, where individuals struggle to make ends meet. On the other hand, saving allows individuals to build wealth over time, providing them with financial freedom and security. In conclusion, while it may be tempting to enjoy one's money immediately, I firmly believe that saving a portion of one's earnings is essential for securing a stable financial future. By doing so, individuals can ensure that they are prepared for the uncertainties of life and can achieve their long-term goals.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;In today's fast-paced world, people are often divided into two categories: those who rush to get things done and those who prefer to take their time. Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously, making it seem like a never-ending race. However, in my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. The constant pressure to meet deadlines, respond to messages, and keep up with the latest trends can lead to anxiety, fatigue, and burnout. For instance, a person who is always in a rush may skip meals, neglect exercise, and sacrifice sleep, which can have severe consequences on their physical and mental well-being. On the other hand, taking the time to enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as nature, conversations, and hobbies, can help reduce stress and promote overall well-being.Furthermore, living life at a slower pace allows individuals to appreciate the beauty around them, build meaningful relationships, and reflect on their experiences. In a world where speed is often valued over substance, it is essential to prioritize quality over quantity and make time for the things that truly matter. By doing so, we can cultivate a sense of calm, clarity, and contentment, leading to a more fulfilling and purposeful life. In conclusion, while the world may be moving at an incredible speed, I firmly believe that living life at a slower pace is the key to a happier, healthier, and more meaningful existence.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;I strongly disagree with the point of view that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. In the past centuries, the population has steadily grown and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. This rapid growth has led to an increased demand for resources, resulting in the destruction of natural habitats such as forests, jungles, and lakes. However, as we destroy these ecosystems, we rob the planet of its delicate balance and biodiversity.The consequences of our actions are far-reaching and devastating. A stable and sustainable environment is essential for regulating the weather, which is crucial for human survival. Unfortunately, our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth. Climate change, deforestation, and species extinction are just a few examples of the catastrophic effects of human activities on the environment. By prioritizing human needs over the preservation of endangered species and their habitats, we are ultimately jeopardizing our own future.It is imperative that we strike a balance between meeting human needs and preserving the natural world. Endangered species play a vital role in maintaining the health of ecosystems, and their loss can have irreversible consequences. Therefore, it is essential that we conserve and protect natural habitats, not just for the sake of endangered animals, but for the well-being of our planet and future generations. By adopting sustainable practices and preserving biodiversity, we can ensure a healthier and more resilient environment for all species, including our own.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The debate about whether university students should be required to attend classes or not has sparked intense discussion among students and educators alike. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes, as it ensures they stay on track and do not miss out on important information. On the other hand, others believe that attending classes should be optional, as it allows them to manage their time more effectively and prioritize their learning. According to my opinion, because it is a university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their own path and decide whether attending classes is beneficial for them or not.To begin with, going to classes can sometimes be a waste of time, especially when the lecturer simply reads from the textbook or delivers information that is readily available online. In such cases, students may feel that their time could be better spent on other activities, such as studying, working on projects, or participating in extracurricular activities. However, some lecturers deliver lectures in a very informative and interesting way, making attending classes a valuable and enriching experience. These lecturers are able to engage students, encourage discussion, and provide valuable insights that may not be available through other means.In conclusion, I believe that attending classes should be optional for university students. By giving students the freedom to choose, they are able to take ownership of their learning and make decisions that are in their best interest. This approach also acknowledges that students are mature individuals who are capable of managing their time effectively and prioritizing their learning. Ultimately, optional class attendance allows students to make the most of their university experience and achieve their academic goals in a way that is most suitable for them.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The impact of technology on people's lives has been a topic of debate for a long time. Many people are always confronted with the problem of whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. On one hand, some argue that technology complicates life by introducing new problems and complexities. For instance, the constant need to update and maintain devices, as well as the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches, can be overwhelming. Moreover, the overreliance on technology can lead to a decline in traditional skills and face-to-face communication.However, I conceded that technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. With the advent of technology, people can now access a vast array of information and services with just a few clicks. Online shopping, mobile banking, and food delivery services have made it possible for people to manage their daily tasks with ease and efficiency. Moreover, technology has also improved communication, enabling people to connect with others across the globe instantly. The convenience and speed that technology provides have saved people a significant amount of time and energy, which can be utilized for more productive and leisure activities.In conclusion, while technology may have some drawbacks, its benefits in simplifying people's lives far outweigh its complications. The convenience, speed, and accessibility that technology provides have revolutionized the way people live, work, and interact with each other. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely to bring even more innovative solutions to make people's lives simpler and more efficient. Therefore, it can be argued that technology indeed makes people's lives simpler rather than more complicated.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";I strongly agree with the statement that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people, such as public figures and celebrities. In my opinion, mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One of the primary motivations is to boost their ratings and circulation numbers. Television and newspapers focus on famous people's lives in order to increase their audience or readership, as sensational stories about celebrities tend to attract a large following.This phenomenon is a reflection of the society we live in, where the most important thing seems to be appearance and gossip. The media caters to this obsession, providing an endless stream of updates on the latest fashion trends, celebrity relationships, and scandals. As a result, the media landscape is filled with frivolous content, overshadowing more substantial and meaningful topics such as social issues, politics, and cultural events.The excessive attention to celebrity lives not only detracts from more significant issues but also creates unrealistic expectations and promotes a culture of voyeurism. It is imperative for the media to strike a balance between entertaining the public and providing thoughtful, in-depth coverage of topics that truly matter. By doing so, they can help shape a more informed and thoughtful society, rather than one that is solely obsessed with the superficial lives of famous individuals. Ultimately, it is crucial for media outlets to reassess their priorities and allocate more attention to substantial topics, rather than the mundane aspects of celebrity culture.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;The debate about whether staying in one place or moving in search of another place is better has been ongoing for a long time. As someone who was born and grew up in a small town, I have had the opportunity to experience the benefits of staying in one place. In my hometown, I have developed strong relationships with my friends and community, which I deeply cherish. The familiarity and comfort of being surrounded by people I know and love is invaluable to me.Moreover, I have grown to love the unique characteristics of my town, including the traffic and environment. The peaceful and serene atmosphere of my town is something that I appreciate and enjoy every day. The traffic, although sometimes slow, is never congested or stressful, allowing me to move around with ease. The environment, with its lush green spaces and clean air, is also a major draw for me. I feel grateful to be able to live in a place where I can breathe fresh air and connect with nature.For these reasons, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving from one place to another. The stability and sense of belonging that comes with staying in one place is essential to my well-being and happiness. I believe that moving to a new place would mean leaving behind the relationships, familiarity, and comfort that I have built over the years. In contrast, staying in one place allows me to deepen my roots, build stronger connections, and truly feel at home. Overall, I am content with my decision to stay in my hometown and do not see myself moving to another place anytime soon.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;The decision of where to live while attending university is a significant one, as it can greatly impact a student's overall experience. Two popular options are living in university dormitories and living in apartments in the community. Both have their advantages, and the choice ultimately depends on individual preferences and priorities.Living in a dormitory has several benefits, particularly for freshman students. It helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university, making the transition to university life smoother. Dormitories are usually located on or near campus, making it easy to access classes, libraries, and other academic facilities. Additionally, living among fellow students can foster a sense of community and camaraderie, which is invaluable for social and emotional support.On the other hand, living off campus in an apartment in the community prepares students for real life. It teaches them valuable life skills such as independence, responsibility, and time management. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, and co-operative. Managing a household, paying bills, and maintaining a living space are essential life skills that are best learned through experience. Living off campus also offers more freedom and privacy, which can be beneficial for students who value their personal space and autonomy.Personally, I would prefer to live off campus in an apartment. I believe that the benefits of independence, responsibility, and real-world experience outweigh the convenience of living in a dormitory. Living off campus allows students to grow and develop essential life skills that will benefit them long after they graduate. While living in a dormitory can provide a comfortable and supportive environment, I think that the lessons learned from living independently are invaluable and better prepare students for their future lives.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;I partially agree with the statement that in today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. In certain situations, working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal, as it allows individuals to achieve their objectives swiftly and efficiently. For instance, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study and acquire new skills, as they can complete tasks quickly and move on to new ones.Moreover, in today's fast-paced world, working quickly is often a necessity. With the increasing cost of living, many people are forced to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. In fact, it is common for people to work in two or three firms in a week, as the expenses have been increased and a single income is no longer sufficient. In such cases, working quickly and efficiently is crucial to manage multiple tasks and responsibilities.However, it is also important to note that working slowly and ensuring accuracy has its own merits. People who work slowly can produce high-quality work and avoid mistakes, which can be costly in the long run. Nevertheless, in today's competitive world, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks and may fall behind their peers. Therefore, striking a balance between speed and accuracy is essential. While working quickly is important, it is equally important to ensure that the work is accurate and reliable. Ultimately, the key to success lies in finding a balance between speed and quality, rather than prioritizing one over the other.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;"The notion that university students do not need to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam is a debated topic. Some argue that attending classes is not necessary, but I disagree. In fact, some universities even have policies where students cannot attend any classes until they pass a prerequisite exam, emphasizing the importance of foundational knowledge. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing an exam, as it is not a definitive measure of their ability to learn.Firstly, students are not constantly experts in every part of a subject. Attending classes provides them with the opportunity to engage with the material, ask questions, and clarify doubts. University classes offer more than just a transmission of information; they provide a space for discussion, critical thinking, and problem-solving. By attending classes, students can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter, which may not be fully captured by a single exam. Furthermore, classes offer students the chance to learn from their peers and instructors, fostering a collaborative learning environment that is essential for academic growth.Moreover, attending classes helps students develop important skills such as time management, teamwork, and communication. These skills are crucial for success not only in academics but also in professional life. Relying solely on passing exams overlooks the holistic development that university education aims to provide. Therefore, while passing exams is an important aspect of university life, it should not be the sole criterion for measuring a student's ability to progress. Attending classes and engaging with the academic community is essential for a well-rounded education. In conclusion, attending classes is a vital part of the university experience, offering benefits that go beyond mere exam preparation."
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;University education is always an important part of one's life, as it provides students with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to succeed in their chosen careers. When it comes to improving the quality of education, one of the most debated topics is how universities should allocate their resources. The statement suggests that universities should spend more money on salaries for university professors to improve the quality of education. However, I disagree with this statement.While professors are essential in guiding and mentoring students, the primary purpose of a university is to provide students with a comprehensive and supportive learning environment. The best way to orientate students is to create an environment that fosters academic excellence, creativity, and critical thinking. Raising the salaries of professors alone may not necessarily achieve this goal. In fact, I believe that the money should be spent on facilities in school or updating resources, such as libraries, laboratories, and technology, which would have a more direct impact on the student's learning experience.By investing in modern facilities and resources, universities can provide students with hands-on experiences, access to the latest technologies, and a comfortable and conducive learning environment. This, in turn, would enable students to engage more effectively with the course materials, explore their interests, and develop their skills. Furthermore, updated resources would also attract and retain high-quality professors, as they would be able to teach and conduct research in a well-equipped and supportive environment. In conclusion, while professors play a vital role in education, I believe that the primary focus should be on the students and providing them with the best possible learning environment, rather than solely on raising professor's salaries.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The statement ""Pets should be treated like family members"" has sparked a heated debate among people. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members, while others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. In my opinion, I agree with the former statement.Firstly, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. The bond between a pet and its owner is unique and special, and it's not uncommon to see people forming strong emotional connections with their pets. Pets provide companionship, comfort, and affection, which are essential human needs. They are always there to greet us when we come home, and they never judge us, unlike some people in our lives.Secondly, pets can be useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Pet therapy involves bringing pets into hospitals, nursing homes, and other settings to provide comfort and affection to people in need. This therapy has been shown to have a positive impact on people's mental and emotional well-being. Additionally, pets can assist people with disabilities, such as guide dogs for the blind and hearing dogs for the deaf. They can also provide protection and security for their owners, serving as a deterrent to potential intruders.In conclusion, pets are indeed more than just animals, they are our friends, companions, and family members. They provide us with love, comfort, and assistance, and it's only fair that we treat them with the same love, respect, and care that we would give to our human family members. By doing so, we can strengthen the bond between humans and animals, and create a more compassionate and harmonious society."
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live.

Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, people often find themselves torn between the charm of small towns and the hustle and bustle of big cities. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, and this personal attitude is the result of many factors. Firstly, I find the excitement of big cities to be incredibly attractive. Living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience, filled with diverse cultural events, historic landmarks, and a melting pot of cuisines from around the world. The constant buzz of activity, the sounds, and the smells all combine to create an exhilarating atmosphere that I find irresistible. Whether it's attending concerts, visiting museums, or simply exploring the city's nightlife, there's always something to look forward to in a big city.Secondly, big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a higher chance of earning a higher income compared to small towns.

Additionally, the higher salaries in big cities can significantly improve one's quality of life, enabling them to enjoy the city's amenities and travel opportunities without financial strain.In conclusion, while small towns have their own unique charm and benefits, such as closer-knit communities and a slower pace of life, my preference for living in a big city is rooted in the exciting lifestyle and the enhanced career and financial opportunities they offer. The dynamic environment and the plethora of opportunities make big cities, for me, the ideal place to live and thrive.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";I disagree with the statement that it is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes. However, the government should take into consideration at the first place that the basic needs of its citizens are met. In this regard, it can be argued that building more accommodating constructions is of paramount importance as it meets people's basic need for shelter. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in, as a roof over one's head is a fundamental necessity.In fact, providing adequate housing is essential for the well-being and dignity of individuals. New buildings can offer modern amenities, better safety features, and more comfortable living conditions, which are crucial for a good quality of life. Furthermore, the construction of new buildings can also stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and contribute to the overall development of a region. Therefore, it is understandable that the government prioritizes new building construction to address the pressing needs of its citizens.Nonetheless, it is also important to note that preserving historic and traditional buildings and homes has its own significance. These structures often hold cultural, historical, and sentimental value, and their preservation can contribute to a sense of community and national identity. However, in the face of competing demands for resources, the government's primary concern should be to ensure that its citizens have access to basic necessities like shelter, before allocating funds to preserve historic buildings. By prioritizing new building construction, the government can create a foundation for a more stable and prosperous society, where citizens can thrive and appreciate the value of their cultural heritage.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I strongly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. In my opinion, the tough experiences we face in life play a crucial role in shaping our skills,Every tough experience makes us more skilled and improves our decision-making abilities. For instance, when we encounter obstacles, we are forced to think critically and come up with innovative solutions. This process of problem-solving enhances our skills and prepares us to tackle similar challenges in the future. Moreover, our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong, our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong, often unknowingly. The resilience we develop through overcoming hardships enables us to navigate life's complexities with greater ease and confidence. We learn to adapt, to persevere, and to rise above adversity, which are essential qualities for achieving success in various aspects of life.In conclusion, I firmly believe that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time indeed become valuable lessons for the future. By embracing challenges and learning from them, we can harness the power of difficult experiences to improve our skills, decision-making, and overall resilience. These valuable lessons not only help us grow as individuals but also equip us with the strength and wisdom needed to navigate life's journey with greater purpose and success.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The statement that drivers should pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic has sparked intense debate. Critics have been castigating the exorbitant use of oil and other resources, and some insist that drivers should be charged an extra fee during rush hours for their supposedly selfish conduct. However, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them.From another point of view, traffic jams are a natural phenomenon that nobody can shun or ban. It is a result of various factors, including urban planning, infrastructure, and the sheer number of vehicles on the road. As such, it is out of drivers' control. Imposing a fee on drivers for navigating through busy streets would be unfair, as they are not solely responsible for the congestion. Many drivers have no choice but to use their vehicles for daily commutes, and penalizing them with extra fees would only add to their financial burden.Moreover, such a fee would disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on their vehicles for work, school, or other essential activities. Instead of charging drivers, governments and urban planners should focus on implementing measures to reduce traffic congestion, such as improving public transportation, optimizing traffic light timings, and investing in infrastructure development. By addressing the root causes of traffic jams, we can create a more efficient and sustainable transportation system, without unfairly burdening drivers with additional fees. In conclusion, I firmly believe that drivers should not be charged extra for driving in busy city streets, and that a more holistic approach to traffic management is needed.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";I strongly agree that one of the best ways parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job. Many parents often warn their children that adult life is much more demanding than school life, filled with responsibilities and stress. However, it is challenging for teenagers to fully comprehend the intensity of adult life without experiencing it firsthand. By taking on a part-time job, students can gain a glimpse into the real world of adulthood, allowing them to understand the expectations and pressures that come with it.In contrast to spending leisure time playing computer games or engaging in other non-productive activities, a part-time job provides students with a valuable opportunity to develop essential life skills, such as time management, responsibility, and financial literacy. By working part-time, students can learn to balance their academic and professional responsibilities, preparing them for the rigors of adult life. Furthermore, a part-time job can also provide students with a sense of independence and self-reliance, as they earn their own money and make financial decisions.During holidays, instead of indulging in excessive screen time, doing a part-time job is an excellent way for students to spend their break. Not only will they gain work experience, but they will also have the opportunity to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, develop communication skills, and build a network of professional contacts. In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take on a part-time job is an effective way for parents to help their children prepare for the challenges of adult life, providing them with invaluable experiences and skills that will benefit them in the long run.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";The debate about whether students should study alone or in groups has been ongoing for years. Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is the pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. As for me, I favor studying alone, because of the following reasons. To begin with, the type of temperament is one of the reasons that makes me choose individual work instead of team work. I am an introverted person and I find it difficult to focus on my studies when I am surrounded by a group of people. When I study alone, I can concentrate better and retain more information.Another reason I prefer studying alone is that I can work at my own pace. In a group setting, some students may be slower or faster than me, and this can hinder my learning process. When I study alone, I can set my own goals and deadlines, and work towards achieving them without any distractions. Additionally, studying alone allows me to take responsibility for my own learning, and I can identify my strengths and weaknesses more easily. I can review and practice the material as many times as I need to, without relying on others to help me understand it.Overall, while some students may thrive in a group study environment, I believe that studying alone is the most effective way for me to learn and achieve my academic goals. By working independently, I can tailor my study approach to my individual needs and learning style, which ultimately leads to better retention and understanding of the material.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;The debate about whether to be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business has been ongoing for a long time. While some people prefer the security and stability of working for an employer, others prefer the freedom and autonomy of being their own boss. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. There are several reasons that justify my preference. Firstly, time is the most valuable thing that I have in my life. When I work for myself, I can manage my time more effectively, allowing me to prioritize my tasks and activities. This flexibility enables me to balance my work and personal life, leading to a more fulfilling and productive experience. Secondly, earning money is the fundamental reason why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. As my own boss, I have the potential to earn more money than I would as an employee. With my own business, I can set my own rates, negotiate with clients, and explore various revenue streams, which can lead to greater financial rewards. In addition, having my own job provides me with a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. I can pursue my passions and interests, creating a career that is meaningful and enjoyable. While there may be challenges and uncertainties associated with being self-employed, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. In conclusion, having my own job offers me the autonomy, flexibility, and financial potential that I desire, making it my preferred choice.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";The question of whether a city should preserve its old, historic buildings or replace them with modern ones is a contentious issue. In my opinion, historic buildings should be preserved as they are important treasures that provide a window into the past, which can be used to learn valuable lessons. These buildings show the lifestyle of people who lived thousands of years ago, giving us a glimpse into the social, cultural, and economic conditions of bygone eras.For instance, the ancient city of Rome is renowned for its historic buildings such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon, which attract millions of tourists every year. These structures have been beautifully preserved and now serve as a testament to the engineering and architectural prowess of the ancient Romans. By preserving these buildings, cities can develop their tourism industries, creating jobs and generating revenue for local economies.Moreover, historic buildings are a part of a city's cultural heritage and identity. Destroying them would be akin to erasing a part of the city's history and character. The preservation of historic buildings also encourages a sense of community and shared ownership among residents, who take pride in their city's unique architecture and heritage. In conclusion, preserving historic buildings is essential for maintaining a city's cultural identity, promoting tourism, and providing a valuable resource for learning about the past. Cities should strive to protect and preserve these important treasures, rather than replacing them with modern buildings, which lack the character and historical significance of their older counterparts. By doing so, cities can ensure that their rich history and cultural heritage are preserved for future generations to appreciate and learn from.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;"The statement ""Parents are the best teachers"" has sparked a heated debate, with some people strongly agreeing and others disagreeing. I firmly believe that parents are indeed the best teachers, and for good reason. From the moment we are born, our parents take on the role of teaching us the basics of life. They show us how to smile, how to walk, and how to perform ordinary routines such as eating. These fundamental lessons lay the foundation for our future development and are essential for our growth.As we grow older, our parents continue to teach us valuable ethic lessons that shape our character and influence our decisions. These lessons, such as honesty, respect, and responsibility, stay with us for the rest of our lives and play a significant role in shaping us into the people we become. Moreover, I believe that the amount of time we spend with our parents at home far surpasses the time we spend at school. This proximity and frequent interaction with our parents allow them to have a profound impact on our lives, making them our most significant teachers.In my opinion, the bond between parents and children is unparalleled, and the lessons learned from parents are often more meaningful and lasting than those learned in a classroom. While teachers at school provide us with academic knowledge, our parents provide us with life skills, emotional support, and a sense of belonging. Therefore, I strongly agree with the statement that parents are the best teachers, as they teach us the most essential lessons in life and have a lasting impact on our development and well-being."
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;The statement that in order to succeed in a new job, the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of the job, is a topic of debate. While having excellent knowledge of the job is crucial, I agree that the ability to adapt to a new environment is more important. The ability to adapt has been proven to be a significant part of job success, as it enables individuals to navigate through unfamiliar terrain, build relationships with colleagues, and understand the company culture.In today's fast-paced work environment, being able to work effectively in a team and communicate with others is essential. Although working alone may be a longer-term aspect of a job, the initial period of adaptation is critical in determining one's success. Excellent knowledge of the job, on the other hand, is beneficial but can be developed over time. A person with excellent knowledge but poor adaptation skills may struggle to apply their knowledge effectively in a new setting.Furthermore, a company benefits from every worker having excellent knowledge, but it is the ability to adapt that enables them to apply this knowledge effectively. If an employee is unable to adapt to the company's environment, their excellent knowledge may go to waste. In contrast, an employee who can adapt quickly to a new environment can learn and grow with the company, making their excellent knowledge a long-term asset. In conclusion, while excellent knowledge is important, the ability to adapt to a new environment is more crucial for success in a new job, as it lays the foundation for effective knowledge application and long-term growth.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers has sparked a debate about their impact on our lives. While some argue that computers have made life easier and more convenient, others claim that they have made life more complex and stressful. In my opinion, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other parts of societies, and their effects are multifaceted.On the one hand, computers have undoubtedly made many tasks easier and more efficient. They have automated many processes, reducing the need for human intervention and increasing productivity. For instance, in the banking sector, computers have enabled online transactions, making it possible for people to manage their finances from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, computers have facilitated communication and access to information, bridging geographical gaps and connecting people worldwide.On the other hand, the increased reliance on computers has also led to a reduction in human roles in many industries. Automation has replaced human labor in manufacturing, customer service, and data entry, among others. While this has increased efficiency and reduced costs, it has also resulted in job losses. Many jobs have vanished as computers have taken over tasks that were previously performed by humans. For example, cashiers have been replaced by self-service machines, and bookkeeping tasks are now performed by accounting software.Despite these drawbacks, it is undeniable that computers have become an integral part of modern life. They have transformed the way we work, communicate, and access information. In conclusion, while computers have made life more convenient and efficient, they have also made many jobs obsolete. It is crucial to acknowledge both the benefits and the challenges posed by computers and work towards creating a balance between technology and human employment. Ultimately, the role of computers in society is here to stay, and it is up to us to harness their potential while mitigating their negative consequences.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;I strongly agree with the statement that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn and broaden their perspectives. From a young age, children's minds are like sponges, absorbing and processing vast amounts of information, and learning a foreign language can help improve their minds and memories.Acquiring a foreign language at a young age can have a profound impact on a child's cognitive development. It enhances their problem-solving skills, memory, and concentration, which can lead to better academic performance in other subjects. Moreover, learning a foreign language extends their vision about other countries, exposing them to diverse cultures, traditions, and ways of life. This, in turn, fosters global understanding, tolerance, and appreciation, essential qualities for success in an increasingly interconnected world.For instance, a child who starts learning Spanish in elementary school will not only gain a new language skill but also develop an understanding of the rich cultural heritage of Spanish-speaking countries. They will be able to appreciate the literature, music, and art of these countries, broadening their cultural knowledge and empathy towards people from different backgrounds. Furthermore, in today's globalized economy, speaking multiple languages can be a valuable asset, opening doors to new career opportunities and cultural experiences.In conclusion, introducing foreign language learning at the onset of schooling can have a transformative impact on children's cognitive, cultural, and professional development. It is an investment in their future, equipping them with the skills necessary to thrive in a multicultural and multilingual world. Therefore, I firmly believe that children should start learning a foreign language as soon as they begin their educational journey, setting them up for a lifetime of learning, growth, and global engagement.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;I disagree with the statement that boys and girls should attend separate schools. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together as it provides them with an opportunity to know each other and learn how to behave with the opposite sex. By attending the same school, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. This interaction is essential in today's society, where men and women work together and need to communicate effectively.Some experts may believe that attending both girls and boys in the same school causes many disadvantages for them, such as distractions and decreased focus on academic performance. However, I believe that these drawbacks can be managed with proper discipline and guidance from teachers. On the other hand, the benefits of co-education far outweigh the disadvantages. When boys and girls study together, they learn to respect and appreciate each other's perspectives, which is crucial for building strong relationships and a harmonious society.Moreover, attending the same school helps boys and girls to develop important social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. These skills are essential in all aspects of life, including personal and professional relationships. By studying together, boys and girls can break down stereotypes and misconceptions about each other, leading to a more inclusive and empathetic environment. In conclusion, I firmly believe that boys and girls should attend the same school, as it provides them with a unique opportunity to learn from each other, develop important social skills, and prepare themselves for a diverse and interconnected world.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The age-old debate about the key to success in life has sparked intense discussion among people. While some argue that careful planning is the pathway to success, others believe that taking risks or chances is the driving force behind achieving one's goals. In my opinion, I firmly believe that success comes from taking calculated risks and persevering through challenges. As the renowned philosopher Aristotle once said, ""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" This quote underscores the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing uncertainty in pursuit of success.In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. Walt Disney, whose illustrious career is a testament to his unwavering dedication, is a prime example of this. Despite facing numerous rejections and setbacks, Disney continued to push boundaries and innovate, ultimately revolutionizing the entertainment industry. His rags-to-riches story is a powerful reminder that success often requires navigating through failures and learning from mistakes.By taking risks and persevering through challenges, individuals can develop resilience, adaptability, and a growth mindset – essential qualities for achieving success. Moreover, playing it safe and sticking to a predictable plan can lead to stagnation and missed opportunities. In contrast, embracing risk-taking and learning from failures can propel individuals towards their goals, fostering innovation, creativity, and personal growth. In conclusion, while careful planning is important, I believe that success ultimately comes from taking calculated risks, learning from failures, and persevering through challenges, as exemplified by the inspiring story of Walt Disney."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I firmly agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. This is a basic part of life, as individuals often encounter situations that are not pleasant, but are necessary nonetheless. In personal and social contexts, people may have to attend events or engage in activities that they do not particularly enjoy, such as family gatherings or community meetings. However, these experiences are essential for building relationships, maintaining social bonds, and contributing to the greater good.In professional lives, tasks that are not enjoyable are a necessary part of many jobs. For instance, nobody likes attending boring conferences or working with a person who isn't well-liked by anyone. Nevertheless, these tasks are crucial for career advancement, networking, and achieving organizational goals. By undertaking such tasks, individuals can develop important skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are valuable in both personal and professional settings.Moreover, doing something that an individual doesn't really enjoy can surprisingly lead to enjoyment. For example, a person who is not fond of public speaking may be required to give presentations at work. Initially, they may feel apprehensive and uncomfortable, but as they continue to practice and receive feedback, they may discover a hidden talent and eventually develop a passion for it. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and confidence, which can be a rewarding experience. Therefore, I strongly believe that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing, as it is an essential part of personal and professional growth, and can ultimately lead to unexpected benefits and enjoyment. By embracing unpleasant tasks, individuals can develop resilience, adaptability, and a broader range of skills, which are essential for success in all aspects of life.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The question of when young adults should gain independence from their parents is a complex and debated issue. On one hand, young adults tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own, as they yearn for autonomy and self-sufficiency. This desire for independence is a natural part of growing up, as they strive to make their own decisions and learn from their own experiences. However, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents is a contentious one, with some arguing that it should be as soon as possible, while others believe it should be delayed.Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time. This allows them to develop important life skills, such as financial management and responsibility, while still having a safety net to fall back on. Additionally, living with parents can provide young adults with emotional support and guidance, which is essential during the challenging transition to adulthood. For example, many young adults who move out too quickly may struggle with the pressures of independent living, such as paying bills and cooking meals, and may end up feeling overwhelmed and stressed. In contrast, those who live with their parents for a longer time can gradually take on more responsibilities and develop a sense of security and stability.Moreover, living with parents can also provide young adults with the opportunity to pursue their education and career goals without the burden of excessive financial stress. By living at home, they can save money, focus on their studies, and gain valuable work experience, all of which are essential for long-term success. In conclusion, while the desire for independence is natural, I firmly believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time, as it provides them with the support, guidance, and security necessary to thrive in today's challenging world.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other, transforming the types of relationships they form and maintain. In the course of the last hundred years, the way the majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one, in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easier than ever. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have bridged the geographical gap, enabling people to stay connected with friends and family who live abroad or in different parts of the country. This has strengthened relationships and fostered a sense of community and belonging. Moreover, technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies, leading to the formation of new relationships and networks.While some may argue that technology has led to social isolation and decreased face-to-face interactions, I believe that the benefits of technology far outweigh the drawbacks. Technology has opened up new avenues for people to meet and interact, such as online forums and social media groups. Additionally, it has also facilitated collaboration and communication among people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.In conclusion, the impact of technology on relationships has been overwhelmingly positive. It has made it possible for people to maintain and form relationships that transcend geographical boundaries, and has enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions. While there may be some negative consequences, the benefits of technology in shaping and enhancing relationships cannot be denied.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The increasing use and development of new technology has led to a significant shift in the way work is performed, with many machines now capable of undertaking tasks that were previously done by humans. Undoubtedly, machines can bring many benefits to society. For one thing, machines are more effective than humans. Unlike humans, machines do not need rest, which means they can work for as long as employers want and consistently produce high-quality products without any mistakes.The advantages of this trend are numerous. Machines can work around the clock, increasing productivity and efficiency in various industries such as manufacturing and transportation. Additionally, machines can perform tasks that are dangerous or difficult for humans, reducing the risk of injury and improving overall safety. Furthermore, machines can process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, which can lead to groundbreaking discoveries and innovations in fields like medicine and science.However, there are also disadvantages to this trend. The increasing reliance on machines has led to job losses and unemployment in certain sectors, as machines replace human workers. This can have significant social and economic implications, particularly for individuals who may not have the skills to adapt to new technologies. Moreover, the over-reliance on machines can also lead to a loss of human skills and craftsmanship, as traditional techniques and methods are forgotten in favor of automated processes.In conclusion, while the increasing use of machines in the workplace has its advantages, such as increased productivity and efficiency, it also has its drawbacks, including job losses and the erosion of human skills. As technology continues to evolve, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of machines and the need to preserve human employment and traditional skills.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The field of information technology (IT) has undergone tremendous advancements over the last 20 years, revolutionizing the way we communicate and access information. The World Wide Web and email have been instrumental in bridging geographical gaps and facilitating global connectivity. However, the statement that future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive is a topic of debate. Every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers, and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution. These innovations have the potential to further enhance our lives, making tasks more efficient and accessible. For instance, interactive boards can transform the education sector by making learning more engaging and immersive. Similarly, multicore computers and high-resolution laptops and tablets can accelerate complex computations and provide stunning visual experiences, respectively.However, there are some negative aspects of information technology that cannot be overlooked. Over-reliance on IT can lead to social isolation, decreased attention span, and increased exposure to cyber threats. Moreover, the rapid obsolescence of devices contributes to electronic waste, posing significant environmental concerns. Despite these drawbacks, it is essential to recognize that the benefits of IT advancements far outweigh the negatives. By acknowledging and addressing the negative consequences, we can harness the power of IT to create a more connected, informed, and progressive world. Ultimately, the future of IT holds immense promise, and with responsible innovation and usage, its positive effects can be maximized, leading to a brighter, more technologically advanced future for all.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The media's obsession with celebrity culture has sparked a heated debate about its impact on children. Many people are worried that this attention to famous people has a profound impact on them, especially on their children. As public figures, celebrities have a great responsibility to set a good example, as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Children often look up to celebrities as role models, and if they engage in questionable behavior, it can have far-reaching consequences.On the other hand, too much news coverage of famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children's future profession. The constant bombardment of images and stories about celebrities can create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of superficiality. Children may become more interested in pursuing fame and fortune rather than developing meaningful skills and talents. This can lead to a lack of diversity in career choices, as children may be more inclined to pursue careers in the entertainment industry rather than in fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).In conclusion, I agree that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. The constant scrutiny and attention given to celebrities can have a profound impact on children's perceptions and aspirations. It is essential for parents, educators, and the media to promote a balanced and realistic view of celebrity culture, emphasizing the importance of hard work, dedication, and positive role models. By doing so, we can help children develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be successful and fulfilled, and encourage them to pursue careers that are meaningful and beneficial to society.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way we live, communicate, and interact with one another. Mobile phones have been widely used by people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our lives. They enable us to stay connected with friends and family, access a vast amount of information, and enjoy various forms of entertainment on the go. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and rely on phones, they may lose their interest in daily activities. Excessive phone usage can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, where individuals prefer to interact with their screens rather than engage in face-to-face conversations or participate in outdoor activities. This can result in a decline in social skills, deepened relationships, and a sense of community. Furthermore, people may become so engrossed in their phones that they neglect their surroundings, leading to a lack of awareness and engagement with the world around them.Besides, the continuous use of mobile phones may damage both the eyesight and physical posture of children. Prolonged screen time can cause eye strain, headaches, and poor posture, which can have long-term effects on their health and wellbeing. Additionally, excessive phone usage can also lead to social isolation, anxiety, and depression, particularly among young people. Therefore, while mobile phones have many benefits, it is essential to use them responsibly and maintain a balance between technology usage and social interaction. By being aware of these potential drawbacks, we can harness the benefits of mobile phones while minimizing their negative impact on our social lives.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The advent of modern forms of communication, such as email and messaging, has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. These advancements have made it possible for individuals to connect with others without the constraints of time and geographical location. On the one hand, I agree that modern forms of communication have changed for the better, as they enable people to interact with others effortlessly and efficiently. For instance, email and messaging apps allow users to send and receive messages at any time, making it easier to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away.However, I also believe that excessive reliance on these modern forms of communication has had some demerits on people's social lives. While email and messaging provide convenience, they lack the depth and intimacy of face-to-face interactions. People are spending more time interacting with screens and less time engaging in meaningful, in-person conversations. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, even if they have a large online social network. Moreover, the lack of nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.In conclusion, while modern forms of communication have made it easier for people to stay connected, I agree that they have had a negative effect on people's social lives to some extent. It is essential to strike a balance between the convenience of digital communication and the importance of in-person interactions. By making a conscious effort to maintain face-to-face relationships and engage in meaningful conversations, individuals can harness the benefits of modern communication while also nurturing their social lives. Ultimately, a balanced approach to communication is necessary to ensure that technology enhances, rather than detracts from, our social connections.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The debate surrounding the encouragement of competition versus cooperation in children has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential, others believe that teaching them to cooperate is more beneficial. In this essay, we will delve into the values of both approaches and explore their implications on a child's development into a useful adult.On one hand, competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle situations independently. This confidence stems from their ability to assess their strengths and weaknesses,,assistantThe debate surrounding the encouragement of competition versus cooperation in children has sparked intense discussion.

In this essay, we will delve into the values of both approaches and explore their implications on a child's development into a useful adult.On one hand, competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle situations independently. This confidence stems from their ability to assess their strengths and weaknesses, and to strive for improvement. As a result, they are more self-sufficient and better equipped to tackle challenges on their own. On the other hand, co-operative children will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team. By working together, they learn to appreciate diverse perspectives, to listen actively, and to build on each other's strengths. This collaborative mindset enables them to approach problems with a more holistic understanding, often leading to groundbreaking solutions.Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below. Competitive children may excel in individual pursuits, while co-operative children may thrive in team-based environments. Ultimately, a balance between competition and cooperation is necessary to raise well-rounded individuals who can adapt to various situations. By acknowledging the merits of both approaches, parents and educators can provide children with a supportive environment that fosters confidence, creativity, and a willingness to collaborate. As children grow into useful adults, they will be able to navigate the complexities of the real world, leveraging their unique blend of independence and teamwork skills to make a positive impact.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other, leading to a significant shift in the types of relationships people make. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects, such as social isolation and decreased face-to-face communication. However, I strongly agree that technology has large positive effects on relationships between people.On the positive side, technology has made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of geographical distance. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video conferencing tools have enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away. This has been particularly beneficial for people who have moved to a new country or city for work or study, and need to maintain relationships with loved ones back home. Moreover, technology has also enabled people to connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies, leading to the formation of online communities and forums.Technology has also facilitated the formation of new relationships, such as online friendships and romantic relationships. Online dating platforms and social media have made it possible for people to meet and connect with others who they may not have met otherwise. Additionally, technology has also enabled people to maintain relationships that may have otherwise fizzled out due to distance or time constraints. Overall, while technology may have some negative effects on relationships, I believe that its positive effects far outweigh the negative ones. By enabling people to connect with each other more easily and maintaining relationships over distance and time, technology has had a profound impact on the way people interact and form relationships.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life become obsolete with technological advancements is a topic of debate. While some argue that it is pointless to preserve them, I strongly disagree. Traditional skills and lifestyles continue to play a vital role in modern society, and their preservation is essential for various reasons.Firstly, traditional skills and lifestyles are still relevant in terms of healthcare. Many ancient practices, such as herbal medicine and acupuncture, have been proven to be effective in treating various ailments. By preserving these traditional skills, we can continue to learn from them and incorporate their wisdom into modern healthcare systems. Moreover, traditional lifestyles often emphasize a connection with nature, which is crucial for environmental protection. For instance, indigenous communities have developed sustainable practices that have helped maintain the balance of ecosystems for centuries.Furthermore, preserving traditional skills and lifestyles is essential for cultural inheritance. They provide a window into the past, allowing us to understand ancient cultures and appreciate their achievements. By studying traditional practices, we can gain valuable insights into how our ancestors tackled problems, which can, in turn, help us address modern challenges. For example, ancient agricultural practices can inform modern sustainable farming methods, while traditional crafts can inspire innovative designs.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the opinion that traditional skills and ways of life are pointless to keep alive. On the contrary, their preservation is crucial for modern society, offering valuable lessons in healthcare, environmental protection, and cultural inheritance. By embracing and protecting our traditional heritage, we can continue to learn from the past, appreciate its wisdom, and apply its principles to tackle the complexities of the modern world. Ultimately, preserving traditional skills and lifestyles is not a nostalgic endeavor, but a forward-thinking strategy that can enrich our lives and contribute to a more sustainable future.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate surrounding the importance of competition versus cooperation in children's development has sparked intense discussion. Some people think it is better to foster a sense of competition in children, as it encourages them to strive for excellence. This mindset drives children to learn and practice, ultimately becoming the best among their peers. A strong competition sense can motivate children to push beyond their limits, achieve their goals, and develop a winning mentality. This, in turn, can translate into various aspects of life, such as academics, sports, and their future careers.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children to develop, both in school activities and within their communities. By teaching children to cooperate, they learn the value of teamwork, mutual respect, and empathy. Cooperative children are more likely to become useful adults, as they understand the importance of collaboration and can work effectively towards a common goal. Moreover, cooperation promotes social skills, conflict resolution, and a sense of belonging, all of which are vital for building strong relationships and contributing to the greater good.In my opinion, a balance between competition and cooperation is necessary for children's holistic development. While competition can drive children to achieve their personal best, cooperation teaches them the value of unity and collective success. By incorporating both values, children can develop a strong sense of self-motivation, as well as the ability to work harmoniously with others. Ultimately, this balanced approach will enable children to become well-rounded, useful adults who can excel in their individual pursuits while contributing positively to their communities. By embracing both competition and cooperation, we can raise a generation of children who are not only driven to succeed but also empathetic and socially responsible.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;The impact of advertising on society has been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it causes more harm than good, while others refute this claim. On one hand, some people claim that the advantages of advertisement outweigh the harms to our lives. They believe that advertising plays a crucial role in informing consumers about new products and services, promoting economic growth, and fostering competition among businesses. On the other hand, it is an undeniable fact that the advertising market gives lots of working opportunities, from producers, writers, to models, and cameramen. This industry provides employment to a significant number of people, contributing to the overall economic well-being of a society.Furthermore, the rise of online advertisement has made it one of the easiest approaches for businesses to reach their target audience. The potential gains of online advertising, such as cheaper costs, convenience, and the ability to easily observe consumer behavior, have made it a preferred choice for many companies. Online advertising allows businesses to reach a wider audience, increase brand awareness, and drive sales, all at a lower cost compared to traditional advertising methods. Additionally, online advertising provides measurable results, allowing businesses to track the effectiveness of their campaigns and make data-driven decisions.In my opinion, while advertising may have some negative effects, such as promoting materialism and manipulating consumer behavior, the benefits it provides to society outweigh the harms. The creation of jobs, promotion of economic growth, and provision of information to consumers are all significant advantages of advertising. Therefore, I believe that advertising is a necessary and beneficial part of our society, and its benefits should be acknowledged and appreciated. Overall, advertising plays a vital role in driving economic growth, providing employment opportunities, and informing consumers, making it a valuable component of modern society.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The art world has long been plagued by inequality, with some modern artists receiving exorbitant sums of money for their creations, while others struggle to make ends meet. It is not uncommon for a modern artist to receive a hefty paycheck for a single masterpiece, while laborers toil for years to earn a similar amount. This stark contrast has led many to argue that the government should intervene to resolve this unfair situation.In a field of art, the value of a piece is often subjective, and the market can be unpredictable. Some artists may create works that are highly sought after, while others may produce pieces that, despite their technical skill and artistic merit, do not command the same prices. As a result, some artists are able to live comfortably off their work, while others must supplement their income with part-time jobs or rely on the support of patrons. Meanwhile, laborers, who work tirelessly to build and maintain the very infrastructure of our society, often go underappreciated and underpaid.Some people view that government should take responsibility for this unfair situation, arguing that it is the duty of the state to ensure that all citizens are able to earn a fair income for their work, regardless of their profession. They propose that the government could implement policies such as subsidies for struggling artists or regulations to cap the prices of art pieces. However, critics against such view argue that government intervention would stifle creativity and lead to a homogenization of art, as artists would be incentivized to produce works that appeal to the masses rather than challenge and innovate. They also argue that the art market is driven by supply and demand, and that the government should not interfere with the natural forces of the market. Ultimately, while the current state of the art world is undoubtedly unfair, the solution is not straightforward, and a nuanced approach is needed to address the complexities of this issue.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The notion that people tend to work longer hours nowadays has sparked a heated debate about the need to restrict working hours. In my opinion, I strongly agree that working hours should be restricted due to the detrimental effects it has on individuals, their families, and society as a whole. People working for extended hours have been found to have adverse effects on their health and personal life. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy, and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy. As a result, they are more prone to developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, which can significantly reduce their quality of life. Furthermore, the lack of physical activity can lead to mental health problems, including depression and anxiety.Besides the physical and mental health implications, working long hours can also lead to an unhealthy obsession with work. Many individuals become extensively addicted to their work and turn into workaholic type persons, neglecting their personal relationships and responsibilities. This can lead to strained relationships with family and friends, ultimately affecting their overall well-being. Moreover, the excessive work hours can also have a negative impact on society, as it can lead to a decrease in productivity and an increase in errors, which can have serious consequences in certain professions.In conclusion, restricting working hours is essential to prevent the negative effects of long working hours on individuals, their families, and society. By implementing reasonable working hours, individuals can maintain a healthy work-life balance, ensuring they have sufficient time for physical exercise, personal relationships, and leisure activities. This, in turn, can lead to a happier, healthier, and more productive workforce.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;I strongly disagree with the statement that a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. While money is undeniably pivotal in today's society, I believe that a successful individual is one who has achieved certain milestones and accomplishments in life, rather than simply accumulating wealth. A person's success cannot be solely measured by their bank account balance.There are various ways to earn money, and not all of them are admirable or lead to a sense of fulfillment. A person can inherit a large sum of money or win the lottery, but that does not necessarily make them successful. On the other hand, a person who has worked hard to achieve their goals, overcome obstacles, and pursued their passions can be considered truly successful, regardless of their income.A successful man is one who has dedicated themselves to their craft, has put in the effort and time required to excel, and has remained passionate about their pursuits. For instance, a scientist who has spent years researching and developing a life-saving cure, or an artist who has honed their skills to create something truly remarkable, can be considered successful, even if they are not wealthy. Their achievements and contributions to society are what truly matter, and their success is measured by the positive impact they have on the world.In conclusion, while money can provide comfort and security, it is not the sole determining factor of a person's success. A successful person is one who has achieved their goals through hard work, dedication, and passion, and has made a meaningful contribution to society. Their accomplishments and the value they have added to the world are what truly define their success, not their wealth.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The notion that the high sales of popular consumer goods are a reflection of the power of advertising rather than the real needs of society is a topic of debate. Nowadays, people's choices of consumption are heavily influenced by various forms of advertising, including television, street, and magazine ads. It is undeniable that advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, often swaying individuals to purchase items they may not necessarily need.This argument may hold some truth, as people are often persuaded by the allure of advertisements, leading them to buy things that do not contribute significantly to their well-being or quality of life. The constant bombardment of ads can create a sense of necessity or desire for products that are not essential, thereby driving sales and boosting revenue for companies. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that buying habits are highly personal and influenced by a multitude of factors, including individual needs, preferences, and financial capabilities.While advertising is a significant factor, it is not the sole determinant of consumer purchasing decisions. Sometimes, the decision to buy a product depends on an individual's genuine needs and their ability to consume. For instance, a person may purchase a new laptop not because of an advertisement, but because their current one is outdated and no longer meets their needs for work or study. Therefore, it is an oversimplification to attribute high sales solely to the power of advertising, ignoring the complex interplay of personal, economic, and social factors that influence consumer choices. In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly has a profound impact on sales, it is not the only driver of consumer behavior, and real needs, along with personal circumstances, also play a significant role.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The notion that paying taxes is sufficient contribution to society is a debated topic. While paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country, serving as a means to fund public goods and services, some people believe that fulfilling this duty is enough. However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfill apart from paying taxes.Paying taxes is indeed a crucial civic duty, as it enables governments to provide essential public services, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. Nevertheless, the role of citizens extends far beyond this financial contribution. For instance, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. These vulnerable groups require assistance, such as volunteering, donating to charitable causes, or simply offering a supportive community. By engaging in these activities, citizens can make a tangible difference in the lives of those in need, contributing to the overall well-being of their society.Furthermore, active citizenship involves participating in community activities, promoting social cohesion, and fostering a sense of responsibility among community members. This can include activities such as mentoring, environmental conservation, or advocating for social justice. By taking on these responsibilities, citizens can help build stronger, more resilient communities, which in turn, can lead to a more harmonious and equitable society. In conclusion, while paying taxes is an essential obligation, it is by no means the only contribution citizens can make to their society. I firmly believe that citizens have a broader range of responsibilities, including supporting vulnerable members, participating in community activities, and promoting social cohesion, all of which are vital to creating a thriving and compassionate society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The notion that schools should prioritize teaching academic subjects closely related to future careers, while downplaying others like music and sports, has garnered significant attention. Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics and physics because these subjects are deemed necessary for students' future professions. However, this narrow perspective overlooks the broader importance of a well-rounded education. I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. While a career is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of life, it is not the sole defining feature of an individual's existence. Personal fulfillment,eduction, physical health, and emotional well-being are equally, if not more, significant. Music and sports, often viewed as peripheral subjects, play a vital role in fostering these essential life aspects. They contribute to the development of creativity, teamwork skills, discipline, and emotional intelligence, all of which are invaluable in both personal and professional spheres.Moreover, subjects like music and sports provide a platform for self-expression and stress relief, contributing to mental health and happiness. They also offer a unique set of skills that are transferable across various professions, such as teamwork, strategy, and perseverance. In an increasingly competitive job market, where technical skills are often prioritized, the soft skills gained through music, arts, and sports can be a distinguishing factor for individuals.In conclusion, while academic subjects are undoubtedly important for future careers, it is misguided to believe that they are the only subjects worthy of focus. A balanced education that includes music, sports, and other extracurricular activities is essential for the holistic development of students. It prepares them not just for their careers, but for life itself, nurturing well-rounded, capable, and happy individuals.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we consume information, and some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet-based media. On the other hand, many others still think that newspapers and magazines are going to stay. In my opinion, I agree with the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with time.The internet has made it possible for people to access news and information from anywhere in the world, at any time. Online news portals and websites have become the primary source of information for many people, especially the younger generation. With the rise of digital media, the circulation of newspapers and magazines has significantly decreased, and many have been forced to shut down. For instance, many newspapers have already started online editions, and some have even stopped printing physical copies altogether.Moreover, online media offers a wide range of benefits, including up-to-date news, easy accessibility, and a vast array of topics to choose from. In contrast, traditional paper media is limited by its physical nature, and the information is often outdated by the time it is printed. Furthermore, the internet has also given rise to new forms of media, such as blogs and podcasts, which have become increasingly popular. As a result, I believe that the days of newspapers and magazines are numbered, and they will eventually become a thing of the past. While some may argue that traditional media still has its own unique charm and benefits, I firmly believe that the convenience and versatility of online media will ultimately lead to the demise of newspapers and magazines.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When choosing a job, the notion that salary is the most important consideration is a prevalent one. In many societies, the size of the salary offered is indeed a crucial factor in determining one's career path. However, I disagree that it is the only consideration that matters. While a decent salary is essential for meeting basic needs and enjoying a certain standard of living, there are other equally vital aspects that need to be taken into account.Aspects such as friendly colleagues, a pleasant work environment, and satisfactory workplace conditions can have a significant impact on a person's happiness and quality of life. A positive and supportive work atmosphere can lead to increased job satisfaction, reduced stress, and improved overall well-being. On the other hand, a toxic work environment can lead to burnout, decreased motivation, and a negative impact on one's mental and physical health. Furthermore, having friendly and like-minded colleagues can foster a sense of belonging, collaboration, and camaraderie, making the work experience more enjoyable and fulfilling.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it is not the only factor that matters. Other aspects such as work environment, colleagues, and workplace conditions can have a profound impact on a person's happiness and quality of life. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between financial rewards and other essential elements that contribute to a satisfying and fulfilling career. By considering these factors, individuals can make informed decisions that prioritize their overall well-being and job satisfaction, leading to a more harmonious and productive work life.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;In today's world, the computer is an essential part of everyday life, and its impact is evident around the globe, affecting children as well. While some may argue that using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children, I disagree. On the contrary, I believe that daily computer use can have numerous benefits for children.One of the primary advantages of computer use for children is the vast array of resources available to them over the internet. The internet provides an unparalleled wealth of information, educational materials, and learning tools that can aid children in their academic and personal development. By using a computer daily, children can access online educational platforms, educational websites, and digital libraries that offer a wide range of learning materials, including e-books, videos, and interactive lessons. This can help them to learn new skills, expand their knowledge, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in various fields.Moreover, computers can also facilitate children's creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills through various software and applications. For instance, graphic design software can help children express their creativity, while programming languages can introduce them to the world of coding and app development. Additionally, online educational games and puzzles can improve their cognitive abilities and hand-eye coordination. Therefore, when used responsibly and under proper guidance, daily computer use can have a profoundly positive impact on children, enhancing their educational, cognitive, and creative abilities. Overall, the benefits of daily computer use for children far outweigh the perceived negative effects, making it an invaluable tool in their overall development.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that children raised in less affluent families are better equipped to handle the challenges of adult life has been a topic of debate among many. According to some people, a child who is brought up in a less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle adult life problems better than those from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as crime, thievery, and thuggery. Growing up in an environment where resources are scarce can lead to a life of desperation, where some may turn to illegal activities as a means of survival. This can have long-lasting effects on a child's development, both mentally and emotionally. Furthermore, the lack of access to proper role models and guidance can exacerbate this issue, making it even more challenging for these children to become productive members of society.Moreover, these individuals will not have access to good education, which is a crucial factor in determining one's success in adult life. Education provides individuals with the necessary skills, knowledge, and critical thinking abilities to navigate the complexities of adulthood. Without it, children from poorer families are at a significant disadvantage, struggling to compete with their more affluent counterparts. This can lead to a cycle of poverty, where lack of opportunities and resources perpetuate a life of hardship and limited possibilities.In conclusion, while some may argue that children from less affluent families are better prepared for adult life, I firmly believe that this is not the case. The lack of access to quality education and the propensity for bad habits make it increasingly difficult for these children to succeed in adult life. Therefore, it is essential to provide support and resources to these families to break the cycle of poverty and ensure that all children have an equal opportunity to thrive.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The notion that a sedentary lifestyle is the primary cause of many medical problems plaguing modern society has gained significant attention in recent years. It is undeniable that modern people are facing a myriad of new health problems and ailments that were less prevalent in the past. Many attribute this trend to the sedentary nature of contemporary life, where physical activity is often sacrificed for the convenience of technology and urbanization. However, I only partially agree with this assertion, as I believe other factors are having an even greater impact on our health.While a sedentary lifestyle certainly contributes to health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it is not the sole culprit. Other significant factors, including poor diet, environmental pollution, and stress, play a more critical role in the development of these health problems. For instance, the widespread consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks has led to a surge in obesity rates, which is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases. Moreover, the increasing levels of air and water pollution in urban areas expose people to harmful toxins, further exacerbating health issues.Additionally, the pressures of modern life, including work-related stress and the constant bombardment of social media, have a profound impact on mental health, leading to conditions such as anxiety and depression. These factors, I argue, have a more profound effect on our overall health than a sedentary lifestyle alone. Therefore, while acknowledging the role of sedentarism in health problems, it is crucial to consider the broader spectrum of lifestyle and environmental factors that collectively contribute to the plethora of health issues faced by modern society. By addressing these multifaceted challenges, we can work towards creating a healthier and more sustainable future.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The debate about when to introduce foreign language instruction has sparked a significant amount of discussion in recent years. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school, as early as ages three or four, while others contend that this should be taught in later years, such as middle school or high school. I personally believe that it is essential for children to be taught a secondary language as early as kindergarten.Introducing a foreign language in kindergarten has numerous benefits for young children. Research has shown that children who learn a second language at a young age tend to have better language skills, improved cognitive abilities, and enhanced cultural awareness. Moreover,Starting foreign language instruction in kindergarten also allows children to develop a strong foundation in the language, which can be built upon in subsequent years. This early introduction can help children to develop a more authentic accent, pronunciation, and grammar, as they are more likely to mimic the sounds and intonations of native speakers.Furthermore, learning a foreign language at a young age can also broaden children's cultural understanding and appreciation. It can help them to develop a more open-minded and tolerant perspective, which is essential in today's globalized world. In conclusion, I firmly believe that foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. It is a valuable investment in a child's future, and can provide them with a lifelong skill that will benefit them in countless ways. By starting early, children can develop a strong foundation in a secondary language, and reap the many cognitive, cultural, and social benefits that come with it.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The international tourism industry has experienced unprecedented growth over the last few decades, with millions of people traveling across the globe each year. While some individuals argue that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh its benefits, I partially disagree with this assertion. On the one hand, the surge in international tourism has indeed led to several issues, including environmental degradation, as popular destinations struggle to cope with the influx of visitors, resulting in pollution, erosion, and loss of biodiversity.Moreover, the cultural and social fabric of local communities can be disrupted by the presence of large numbers of tourists, which may lead to the erosion of traditional practices and values. However, I believe that flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of the local economy. When managed sustainably, tourism can generate significant revenue and create employment opportunities for local residents, thereby contributing to the overall economic development of the area. Furthermore, tourism can also promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, as visitors learn about and engage with the customs and traditions of the host community.In conclusion, while international tourism does pose some problems, I think that its benefits can outweigh its drawbacks if properly managed. With careful planning and regulation, the negative impacts of tourism can be mitigated, and the industry can be harnessed to drive economic growth, preserve cultural heritage, and foster global understanding. Ultimately, the key to reaping the rewards of international tourism lies in striking a balance between economic development and environmental and social responsibility.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The statement that children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home because some can learn more efficiently by doing so is a debatable topic. While it is true that certain educational programs can be beneficial for children's learning, I disagree with the notion that watching TV should be promoted as a regular learning activity.Watching TV is a very passive action, where children are merely recipients of information without actively engaging with it. This passive learning can lead to a lack of critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Moreover, excessive TV watching can hinder children's physical and mental development, as it limits their opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, and hands-on learning experiences.On the other hand, children who participate in activities that foster creativity, cooperation, and competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. Activities such as sports, arts, and group projects encourage children to think critically, work together, and develop problem-solving skills. These skills are essential for academic success and personal growth, and are often lacking in a TV-dominated learning environment.Instead of increasing TV watching time, schools and parents should focus on providing children with engaging, interactive, and hands-on learning experiences. This can include outdoor activities, group projects, and creative pursuits that promote critical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving. By doing so, children can develop a more comprehensive range of skills, leading to better academic performance and a more well-rounded education. In conclusion, while TV can be a useful learning tool, it should not be relied upon as a primary source of education, and children's learning experiences should be balanced with more active, engaging, and interactive activities.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The widespread use of the internet has led to a significant shift in the way people work and study. With the ability to access vast amounts of information and communicate with others remotely, many individuals are now able to work or study from the comfort of their own homes. While some consider this to be a major advantage, others reject it as a disadvantage.On one hand, working or studying from home can be incredibly convenient, allowing individuals to save time and money on transportation and avoid the distractions and stress of commuting. However, on the other hand, some employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, they spend a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues, which can harm their deliverables. This can lead to decreased productivity and efficiency, ultimately affecting the quality of work.Similarly, teachers think that students who study from home can be disadvantaged as they are unable to clear their doubts in study topics instantly. The lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and peers can hinder the learning process, leading to confusion and misunderstandings. These factors can significantly affect people who work or study from home, leading to a sense of isolation and disconnection from their colleagues and peers.In my opinion, while working or studying from home has its advantages, the disadvantages cannot be overlooked. The lack of social interaction and human connection can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and emotional well-being. Furthermore, the potential decrease in productivity and efficiency can have long-term consequences on one's career and academic success. Therefore, I believe that a balance between working or studying from home and interacting with others in a traditional setting is essential to reap the benefits of both worlds.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The rise of international tourism has led to a surge in global interactions, with people from diverse cultural backgrounds coming together. While some argue that this phenomenon causes tension between individuals from different cultures, the reality is more nuanced. In my opinion, international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different cultures.On the one hand, cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. For instance, varying norms and customs can result in unintentional offense or miscommunication. Moreover, the influx of tourists can put a strain on local resources and infrastructure, leading to frustration among residents. However, these initial tensions often serve as a catalyst for meaningful interactions and exchanges. As people from different cultures engage in debates and discussions, they begin to break down stereotypes and gain a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives.Most people, when faced with conflict or debates, will attempt to understand each other's viewpoints, leading to a more profound appreciation of cultural differences. Through these interactions, tourists and locals alike can develop empathy and tolerance, ultimately fostering greater global understanding. Furthermore, international tourism promotes cross-cultural exchange, allowing individuals to experience and learn from diverse traditions, customs, and ways of life. This, in turn, can lead to a more harmonious and interconnected world, where cultural diversity is celebrated and valued.In conclusion, while international tourism may initially cause tension between people from different cultures, it ultimately leads to a greater understanding and appreciation of our global diversity. As people engage with each other, they will inevitably try to understand each other's perspectives, leading to a more peaceful and interconnected world.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The statement that celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and that this sets a bad example to young people, is a topic of ongoing debate. Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do, and that this can have a negative influence on young people. It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public, flaunting their wealth and material possessions, which can create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of superficiality.However, it is also important to note that not all celebrities are alike, and that some do lead young people in the right direction. Many celebrities use their platform to raise awareness for social causes, promote education and self-improvement, and inspire young people to pursue their passions and work hard to achieve their goals. For example, some celebrities use their wealth and influence to support charitable organizations and initiatives, setting a positive example for young people and demonstrating the importance of giving back to the community.In conclusion, while it is true that some celebrities may prioritize their glamour and wealth over their achievements, it is not fair to generalize this to all celebrities. Many celebrities are using their platform to make a positive impact and set a good example for young people. Therefore, I only partially agree with the statement, and believe that it is essential to recognize and appreciate the positive contributions that many celebrities make to society. By doing so, we can promote a more balanced and nuanced view of celebrity culture and its influence on young people.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;The notion that children can effectively learn from watching television has sparked a heated debate. While it is true that TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it, On the one hand, television offers a wide range of educational programs that can enhance a child's knowledge and understanding of various subjects, including history, science, and culture. By watching these programs, children can gain valuable insights and develop critical thinking skills. Moreover, TV can also provide children with exposure to different languages, customs, and ways of life, broadening their perspective and fostering empathy and tolerance.On the other hand, allowing students to watch TV at both school and home can have an adverse impact on their overall growth. Excessive TV watching can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health problems. Furthermore, it can also distract children from more important activities such as reading, outdoor play, and socializing, which are essential for their physical, emotional, and social development. Additionally, watching TV can also lead to a decline in attention span and a decrease in academic performance, as children may become more focused on entertainment than education.In conclusion, while TV can be a valuable tool for learning, it is crucial for parents and educators to strike a balance between TV watching and other activities that promote overall growth and development. Children should be encouraged to watch educational programs, but limits should be set to ensure that TV watching does not become a substitute for more important activities. By doing so, children can effectively learn from watching television without compromising their overall growth and development.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The notion that workers over 50 are less responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace has sparked a heated debate. Proponents of this idea argue that older workers are less adaptable and therefore, younger workers are to be preferred. However, I strongly reject this idea, as it oversimplifies the complexities of age and workplace performance.Older workers are often stereotyped as being stuck in their ways, unwilling to embrace new ideas and technologies. It is claimed that they are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm, which allegedly hinders their ability to innovate and adapt. Furthermore, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their taste for monotony and safe ideology, which may lead to a resistance to change. However, this does not mean that they are incapable of learning or growing.On the other hand, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor that can help young workers outrank the elderly. Younger workers are often more familiar with the latest technologies and trends, giving them an edge in terms of responsiveness to changing ideas. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that older workers are unable to acquire new knowledge or skills. With proper training and support, older workers can be just as responsive and adaptable as their younger counterparts.In conclusion, while it is true that older workers may have a different approach to change, it is unfair to assume that they are less responsive to new ideas. By recognizing the value of experience and knowledge, and providing opportunities for growth and development, we can tap into the wisdom and expertise of older workers, and create a more inclusive and diverse workplace. Ultimately, responsiveness to change is not solely determined by age, but by an individual's willingness to learn, adapt, and grow.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The use of machines is increasing day by day, which is reducing physical work done by humans. This trend has sparked a debate about whether the advantages of machines outweigh the disadvantages. On one hand, some people think that the usage of machines is harmful for the health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. Prolonged periods of inactivity can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and mental health issues. As humans rely more on machines, they engage in less physical activity, which can have detrimental effects on their overall well-being.On the other hand, many people believe that using machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing a similar amount of work. Machines have increased efficiency and productivity, allowing humans to complete tasks at a faster rate. This, in turn, has led to significant economic benefits, as businesses and industries can produce more goods and services with less labor. Furthermore, machines have also taken over tasks that are hazardous or require a high level of physical exertion, reducing the risk of injury and improving workplace safety.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact of machines on human health, I believe that the advantages of machines outweigh the disadvantages. The benefits of increased efficiency, productivity, and safety cannot be ignored. However, it is essential to strike a balance between machine usage and human physical activity. By incorporating regular exercise and physical activity into our daily routines, we can mitigate the negative effects of machine usage and reap the benefits of technological advancements. Ultimately, machines are tools designed to improve our lives, and with responsible usage, they can have a profoundly positive impact on human society.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;"The notion that traditional skills and ways of life will inevitably die out as a country develops its technology, and that it is pointless to try and keep them alive, is a topic of debate. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated, making way for modern advancements. However, I totally disagree with this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways of life belong to the value of culture. They make significant differences between countries, allowing each nation to maintain its unique identity. The preservation of these skills and ways is essential for cultural diversity and heritage. For instance, traditional crafts, music, and art forms are distinctive elements of a country's cultural landscape. They evoke a sense of nostalgia and continuity with the past, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of one's roots.Consequently, people feel proud of their country and its rich cultural heritage, and thus, are motivated to keep reserving these conventions. The effort to preserve traditional skills and ways of life is not pointless; rather, it is a vital aspect of maintaining national identity and cultural continuity. By preserving these aspects, we ensure that future generations can learn from and appreciate the achievements and traditions of their ancestors. Furthermore, traditional skills and ways of life can often provide valuable insights and solutions to modern problems, making them still relevant and useful in today's world.In conclusion, traditional skills and ways of life are an integral part of a country's cultural fabric, and their preservation is essential for maintaining national pride, cultural diversity, and continuity. It is not pointless to try and keep them alive; instead, it is a necessary effort to ensure the continued richness and uniqueness of our cultural heritage."
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The issue of reducing traffic congestion in cities has become a pressing concern for urban planners. In my opinion, I partially agree that minimizing the need for people to commute from home for work, education, or shopping is an effective way to alleviate traffic overload. Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots, where people from diverse backgrounds converge, and the sheer number of residents has led to an unprecedented level of traffic congestion.The problem of traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused the interest of many city planners, who are now brainstorming innovative solutions to mitigate this issue. While reducing the need for daily commutes is a viable option, it is not the only solution. City planners can still opt for non-personal vehicle strategies, such as promoting public transportation, cycling, and walking infrastructure. Furthermore, the exploitation of suburb areas can also help to distribute the population more evenly, reducing the pressure on city centers and subsequently decreasing traffic congestion.Moreover, technological advancements and flexible work arrangements can also play a significant role in minimizing the need for physical commutes. For instance, remote work options and online education platforms can reduce the number of people traveling to work or school. However, this may not be applicable to all industries, such as healthcare or manufacturing, where physical presence is required. In conclusion, while reducing the need for people to travel from home is a crucial aspect of alleviating traffic congestion, it is not the sole solution. A multi-faceted approach, incorporating non-personal vehicle options, suburb area development, and technological innovations, is necessary to effectively address the issue of traffic overload in cities.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The lives of celebrities are often perceived as the epitome of success, with their glamour and wealth captivating the attention of millions. However, it is argued that taking them as role models can have detrimental effects on young people. I strongly agree with this statement, as the influence of celebrities on the youth can be particularly damaging.Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities, who are often portrayed as idols to be emulated. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth, as their lifestyles and behaviors are frequently unrealistic and unhealthy. This can be proven by examining the impact of celebrity culture on the health and personality of young people. For instance, the constant bombardment of idealized body images in the media can lead to low self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, and eating disorders among young people. Moreover, the glorification of reckless behavior, such as substance abuse and promiscuity, can encourage young people to engage in similar activities, putting their physical and mental health at risk.Furthermore, the cult of celebrity can also have a corrosive effect on the personality of young people, fostering a culture of narcissism and entitlement. The constant exposure to the lavish lifestyles of celebrities can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of disillusionment among young people, leading to a lack of motivation and purpose. Therefore, it is crucial for young people to be aware of the potential dangers of emulating celebrities and to seek out more positive and realistic role models, such as family members, teachers, or community leaders. By doing so, they can develop a more balanced and healthy perspective on life, and avoid the pitfalls of celebrity culture.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The issue of achieving equal numbers of male and female students in universities has been a topic of discussion for many years. The goal is to realize an equal proportion of developing human resources, regardless of gender. I partially agree that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.On the one hand, there are many institutions that have already implemented policies to accept the same average number of male and female students in various courses. This approach has contributed to bridging the gender gap in higher education. Moreover, the proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world, indicating a positive trend towards achieving gender equality. For instance, in fields such as medicine, law, and social sciences, the number of female students has increased significantly, demonstrating that women are just as capable as men in pursuing higher education.On the other hand, I disagree that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Some fields, such as engineering and physics, have traditionally been male-dominated, and imposing a quota system could lead to less qualified candidates being accepted. Moreover, students should be accepted based on their academic merit, skills, and passion for the subject, rather than their gender. Imposing a strict gender balance could undermine the principles of fairness and equality.In conclusion, while I agree that achieving a balance between male and female students is important, I believe that universities should focus on providing equal opportunities and encouraging women to pursue higher education, rather than imposing a strict quota system. By doing so, we can ensure that the most talented and dedicated students, regardless of gender, have access to higher education and can contribute to the development of human resources.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;The detrimental effects of smoking have been well-documented, and it is now widely acknowledged that smoking kills. In light of this, people the world over have designated smoking as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. The negative impact of smoking is not only limited to the smoker themselves, but also to those around them. This bad habit is also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers, who are around where smoking is taking place. Second-hand smoke has been proven to be just as deadly as firsthand smoke, and it is unacceptable that innocent bystanders should be subjected to these risks.Therefore, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations, where people are forced to congregate in close proximity. By designating certain areas as smoke-free, governments can significantly reduce the risks associated with passive smoking. Furthermore, making smoking illegal in public places can also help to reduce the social acceptability of smoking, and encourage smokers to quit. In conclusion, considering the harmful effects of smoking on both smokers and non-smokers, I strongly agree that all countries should implement rules making smoking illegal in all public places except in certain designated areas. This would not only protect the health and wellbeing of citizens but also contribute to a cultural shift away from this lethal habit. By taking a firm stance against smoking in public, governments can help to create a healthier and more considerate society for all.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The notion that tourism is a modern form of colonialism is a concept that has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation, and irreparable damage to the exploited places. This perspective argues that the influx of tourists can lead to inflated prices, displacement of local communities, and degradation of natural habitats. Moreover, the economic benefits of tourism often bypass local populations, instead lining the pockets of large corporations and foreign investors.However, I reject the idea that tourism is inherently a form of colonialism. While it is true that unregulated tourism can have detrimental effects, I believe that responsible and sustainable tourism practices can have numerous benefits for local communities. Tourism can provide economic opportunities, promote cultural exchange, and support conservation efforts. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching processes is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between humans and their surroundings. By educating tourists about local customs, environmental concerns, and cultural sensitivities, we can foster a more respectful and sustainable form of tourism.Furthermore, many destinations are now adopting eco-tourism and community-based tourism models, which prioritize local ownership, environmental stewardship, and cultural preservation. These approaches ensure that tourism revenues benefit local communities and support the conservation of natural and cultural resources. Ultimately, tourism can be a powerful tool for economic development, cultural exchange, and environmental conservation, as long as it is managed responsibly and with the involvement of local stakeholders. By striking a balance between economic, environmental, and social considerations, we can create a more equitable and sustainable tourism industry that benefits both visitors and host communities.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;The advent of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has revolutionized the way we live and work. The emergence of the World Wide Web and email communication has significantly enhanced our standard of living and work efficiency. The internet has made it possible to access vast amounts of information, connect with people globally, and conduct business transactions with ease. As a result, productivity and innovation have increased, leading to unprecedented economic growth and improvement in the overall quality of life.However, it is believed that the evolution of IT also proves to be detrimental. With the rapid developing pace of IT, it seems to have turned its users into its slaves. People are now heavily reliant on technology, spending a significant amount of time staring at screens, and neglecting other aspects of their lives. This has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, deepened social isolation, and exacerbated mental health issues. Furthermore, the over-reliance on IT has also raised concerns about job displacement, as automation and artificial intelligence begin to replace human workers.In my opinion, while future developments in IT may have some negative effects, I do not entirely agree that they will outweigh the positive effects. IT has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. Moreover, IT can also promote global understanding, cultural exchange, and economic empowerment. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of IT, and ensure that its development is guided by ethical considerations and a commitment to improving human well-being. By doing so, we can harness the power of IT to create a better future for all.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians, with many individuals adopting a plant-based diet for various reasons. While some may assume that animal rights issues are the primary motivator, I agree that people are turning to vegetarianism for reasons beyond this concern. In fact, the main reason for the surge in vegetarianism is the pursuit of health improvement. A well-planned vegetarian diet has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. By excluding meat and focusing on whole, plant-based foods, individuals can experience significant health benefits, including weight loss, improved digestion, and increased energy levels.In addition to health improvement, religious beliefs also contribute to the adoption of a vegetarian diet. Certain faiths, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, advocate for a vegetarian lifestyle, promoting non-violence and compassion towards all living beings. For example, many Hindus follow a lacto-vegetarian diet, which excludes meat, fish, and eggs, but allows dairy products. This spiritual motivation has led many individuals to adopt a vegetarian diet, not only for personal health benefits but also as a way to connect with their faith and cultural heritage.Furthermore, environmental concerns and food sustainability are also driving factors in the rise of vegetarianism. With the growing awareness of climate change and the significant impact of animal agriculture on the environment, many people are choosing a plant-based diet as a way to reduce their carbon footprint. Overall, while animal rights issues may still be a consideration for some, it is clear that the popularity of vegetarianism can be attributed to a range of factors, including health improvement, religious beliefs, and environmental concerns. As the world becomes increasingly health-conscious and environmentally aware, it is likely that the trend towards vegetarianism will continue to grow.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The notion that traditional skills and ways of life become obsolete when a country advances its technology is a contentious issue. While some argue that it is futile to preserve these outdated practices, I disagree with this opinion to a large extent. There is no doubt that the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied by modern skills and new lifestyles. This inevitable shift can lead to the perception that traditional practices are no longer relevant.However, from my point of view, what can be expected is a change in the role of tradition, but not its disappearance from society. Traditional skills and ways of life are often deeply rooted in a country's culture and identity. Instead of disappearing, they can evolve and adapt to the new technological landscape. For instance, many artisans and craftsmen are now using technology to enhance and promote their traditional crafts, making them more accessible and appealing to a wider audience.Moreover, preserving traditional skills and ways of life can also have practical benefits, such as promoting cultural diversity, preserving historical heritage, and providing a sense of community and continuity. By embracing both traditional and modern practices, a country can create a unique blend of old and new, allowing it to stand out in an increasingly globalized world. In conclusion, while technology will undoubtedly bring changes to traditional skills and ways of life, it is not pointless to try and keep them alive. Rather, it is an opportunity to redefine and revitalize their role in society, ensuring their continued relevance and importance.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;I strongly disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. In fact, zoos play a vital role in education, conservation, and research. One of the primary purposes of zoos is to provide a means of education for learners of all ages. By exhibiting a wide range of species, zoos offer a unique opportunity for people to learn about wildlife and the importance of conservation. For instance, zoos can provide real and vivid materials for students, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the natural world.At a higher level, zoos are also beneficial for university students who are pursuing studies in biology and related fields. These institutions provide students with the opportunity to conduct research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which would otherwise be inaccessible. This hands-on experience enables students to gain a more comprehensive understanding of biological concepts and principles. Moreover, the data collected from zoos can be used to inform conservation efforts and develop effective strategies for protecting endangered species.Furthermore, the process of globalization has led to the encroachment upon natural habitats, making zoos an essential component of conservation efforts. As human activities continue to destroy and fragment natural habitats, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species to thrive. By supporting breeding programs and conservation initiatives, zoos can help to maintain healthy populations of species that are under threat in the wild. In conclusion, zoos have a multifaceted purpose that extends beyond entertainment, and their role in education, research, and conservation is indispensable in today's world.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";The extinction of minority languages has become a pressing issue in recent years, with many languages spoken by small numbers of people at risk of disappearing forever. This has sparked a debate about whether governments should allocate public funds to preserve these languages. On one hand, some argue that spending money on saving minority languages would be a waste of resources, as it would not have a significant impact on the overall development of the country. They believe that the funds could be better utilized in other areas, such as education, healthcare, or infrastructure.On the other hand, others argue that preserving minority languages is essential for maintaining cultural diversity and heritage. Despite the above arguments, I still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. Forming a language must be undergone thousands of years, thus it deserves to be respected and preserved. Language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cultures in the world. By preserving minority languages, we can ensure that the cultural identity and traditions of the communities that speak them are protected and passed down to future generations.Moreover, language preservation can also promote cultural exchange and understanding, as well as contribute to the richness and diversity of human expression. In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that preserving minority languages is a worthwhile investment for governments. It is our responsibility to protect and preserve these languages, not just for the communities that speak them, but for the benefit of humanity as a whole. By doing so, we can ensure that the world remains a vibrant and diverse place, where different cultures and languages can thrive and coexist.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The allocation of a country's health budget is a critical decision that can have far-reaching consequences on the overall well-being of its citizens. The statement suggests that a significant portion of the health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. I strongly agree with this statement, as it aligns with the timeless saying in medicine, ""prevention is better than cure."" This adage emphasizes the importance of taking proactive steps to prevent illnesses rather than treating them after they occur.Diverting funds to health education and preventative measures can have numerous benefits. For instance, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases, as it can reduce the financial burden on the healthcare system in the long run. By investing in health education, people can be empowered to make informed decisions about their lifestyle choices, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Moreover, children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food, as well as harmful food, to instill healthy eating habits from a young age. This can help prevent obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases that are on the rise among children and adolescents.By prioritizing health education and preventative measures, a country can reduce the incidence of diseases, improve the quality of life of its citizens, and ultimately, reduce healthcare costs. Therefore, I firmly believe that diverting a large proportion of the health budget to health education and preventative measures is a wise decision that can have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of a nation. It is essential to adopt a proactive approach to healthcare,, rather than relying solely on treatment, to create a healthier and more sustainable future for all."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The notion that university education should be restricted to only the very best academic students has sparked intense debate. While some argue that this approach ensures academic excellence, it is also important to consider the diverse benefits that university education provides. On the one hand, outstanding academic students are indeed eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. They have demonstrated exceptional aptitude and dedication to their studies, and university provides them with the ideal environment to further hone their skills and knowledge. Restricting university education to these students could potentially lead to a more focused and high-achieving academic community.On the other hand, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. It offers a platform for students to explore their creativity, engage in extracurricular activities, and develop essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. By restricting university education to only the top academic performers, we risk denying opportunities to students who may excel in other areas, such as art, music, or sports.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. While it may lead to a more academically elite student body, it also limits opportunities for students who may not be academically inclined but have other talents and strengths. Therefore, I disagree that university education should be restricted to only the very best academic students. Instead, universities should strive to create a diverse and inclusive environment that caters to different learning styles, talents, and interests, allowing students to grow and develop in their own unique ways. By doing so, we can foster a more well-rounded and dynamic society.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"The statement ""Parents are the best teachers"" is a topic of debate among many individuals. Children grow up with two important people in their lives, their parents and teachers, who play a significant role in shaping their future. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that teachers are the best option for children's education in some aspects.While parents provide love, care, and basic values to their children, teachers offer a more structured and professional approach to learning. Teachers are trained to impart knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and encourage independence in their students. They have the expertise and experience to guide children through various subjects and help them develop a deeper understanding of the world around them. In contrast, parents, although well-intentioned, may not always possess the necessary skills or patience to teach their children effectively.Furthermore, teachers provide a more objective and unbiased perspective on various topics, which is essential for children's intellectual and emotional growth. They also offer a wider range of experiences and exposure to different cultures, traditions, and ways of thinking, broadening children's horizons and fostering empathy and tolerance. Additionally, teachers are better equipped to identify and nurture a child's unique talents and abilities, helping them to reach their full potential.In conclusion, while parents play a vital role in a child's life, I believe that teachers are the best option for children's education in many aspects. They provide a professional, structured, and objective approach to learning, which is essential for a child's academic, emotional, and social development. Therefore, I disagree with the statement ""Parents are the best teachers"" and believe that teachers are better suited to provide children with the education and guidance they need to succeed in life."
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When choosing a job, the salary is often considered the most important consideration. In recent years, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone, as it is widely believed that a high-paying job is the key to a successful and comfortable life. However, I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job.On one hand, I agree that money is very essential in order to meet human's basic needs. A decent salary ensures that individuals can provide for themselves and their families, and enjoy a certain level of financial security. Moreover, a good salary can also offer opportunities for personal and professional growth, such as pursuing further education or training. In this sense, a high salary can be a significant motivator for many people.On the other hand, I disagree that salary should be the only consideration when choosing a job. Other factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and personal fulfillment are also crucial in determining career happiness and success. A job that offers a sense of purpose and meaning, opportunities for creativity and innovation, and a supportive work environment can be just as valuable as a high salary. Furthermore, factors such as job security, opportunities for advancement, and alignment with personal values and interests should also be taken into account.In conclusion, while salary is an important consideration when choosing a job, it should not be the only factor. A balance between financial needs and personal aspirations is essential for long-term career satisfaction and happiness. By considering a range of aspects, including salary, job satisfaction, and personal fulfillment, individuals can make informed decisions that lead to a rewarding and successful career.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The notion that taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to high levels to discourage the use of private cars is a complex issue that warrants careful consideration. On one hand, I support this idea because the burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is indeed wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Cars have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy due to their wasteful oil consumption, which contributes to air pollution, climate change, and depletion of natural resources.However, I also reject this idea to some extent because increasing taxation on petrol and diesel fuel would have far-reaching consequences on the economy and society. For instance, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary products such as rice, meat, or even vegetables, as transportation costs would be passed on to consumers. This would disproportionately affect low-income households who rely on these essential items for their daily needs.Furthermore, countries that import oil would be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially, which could compromise their sovereignty and economic stability. This could lead to a vicious cycle of dependence, where countries are forced to prioritize their relationships with oil-exporting nations over their own environmental and economic concerns.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the need to reduce our reliance on private cars and promote sustainable transportation, I believe that increasing taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be done in a nuanced and gradual manner, taking into account the potential economic and social implications. Alternative solutions, such as investing in public transportation, promoting carpooling and cycling, and encouraging the use of electric or hybrid vehicles, should also be explored to mitigate the environmental impact of private car use.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The notion that a police force carrying guns promotes a higher level of violence in society is a topic of intense debate. I partially agree with this opinion, and the reasoning behind it is multifaceted. The increasing number of street criminals has led to the arming of police forces, which has become one of the most significant concerns for many people in today's society. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society for specific reasons.One of the primary reasons is that the presence of guns can escalate situations, leading to more violent confrontations. When police officers are armed, they may be more likely to use their firearms, even in situations where alternative methods of de-escalation could be employed. This, in turn, can lead to a higher number of fatalities and injuries, contributing to a more violent society. Furthermore, the visibility of guns can also perpetuate a culture of fear and aggression, where citizens feel the need to arm themselves for protection, thus creating a vicious cycle of violence.However, it is also important to consider the context in which police forces carry guns. In many countries, the arming of police is a response to the increasing threat posed by armed criminals. In such cases, the presence of guns can serve as a deterrent to potential offenders and provide police officers with the means to protect themselves and the public. Ultimately, the relationship between police carrying guns and societal violence is complex, and a nuanced approach is necessary to address this issue. While there are valid concerns that the presence of guns can contribute to a more violent society, it is also crucial to recognize the role that armed police forces play in maintaining public safety.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;"The role of technology in education has been a topic of discussion in recent years. The statement ""With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly"" is one that I strongly agree with. In education, it is believed that technology helps students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.The richness of technology provides students with a vast amount of information and resources that were previously inaccessible. With just a few clicks, students can access a wide range of educational materials, including e-books, online tutorials, and educational videos. This wealth of information enables students to explore topics in greater depth and breadth, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. For instance, online resources such as Khan Academy and Coursera offer a wide range of courses and tutorials that cater to different learning styles and needs.The convenience of technology is another factor that facilitates quick and efficient learning. With the help of mobile devices and laptops, students can access information and learn anywhere, anytime. This flexibility allows students to learn at their own pace, and revise and review material as many times as they need to. Additionally, technology-enabled tools such as language learning apps and math software provide interactive and engaging ways for students to practice and reinforce their learning. Overall, the integration of technology in education has revolutionized the way students learn, and I firmly believe that it has a positive impact on their ability to learn more information and learn it more quickly."
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;The last hundred years have witnessed unprecedented technological advancements, transforming the world as we know it. While some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives, I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter, as well as my own view's explanations, would be analyzed and given, respectively.On the one hand, it is undeniable that technological progress has its downsides. The over-reliance on technology has led to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health issues. Moreover, the constant exposure to screens and social media has resulted in decreased attention span, increased stress levels, and a sense of isolation. These are valid concerns that cannot be overlooked. However, I believe that the benefits of technological advancements far outweigh the negative effects.On the other hand, technological progress has improved the quality of life in numerous ways. Medical breakthroughs have increased life expectancy, and the internet has made information and education accessible to people worldwide. Furthermore, technology has enabled instant global communication, bridging cultural and geographical gaps. In my opinion, these advantages demonstrate that technological progress has a net positive impact on people's lives. By adopting a balanced approach to technology usage, we can mitigate the negative effects while continuing to reap the numerous benefits that technology has to offer. In conclusion, while acknowledging the potential drawbacks, I firmly believe that the technological progress of the last hundred years has had a predominantly positive influence on our lives.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The issue of violence in television programs has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some argue that it is a form of entertainment and a reflection of reality, I firmly believe that there is a large amount of violence in television programs that we should reduce. One of the primary reasons for this is the impact it has on children. Governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children's television programs in order to tackle this problem more effectively. This is because, as a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, and are therefore more susceptible to the negative influences of violent content.Exposure to violent television programs can lead to aggressive behavior, desensitization to violence, and a lack of empathy in children. By removing violent content from children's programming, governments can help to protect young minds and promote a more positive and peaceful environment. However, it would be a different story for television programs or movies that are specifically designed for mature audiences. It would be a violation of adults' civil liberties if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies, as adults have the capacity to make informed decisions about what they watch and can distinguish between fiction and reality.In conclusion, reducing violence in television programs is crucial, especially when it comes to children's programming. By taking steps to prohibit violent content in children's television programs, governments can play a significant role in shaping the minds of future generations and promoting a more peaceful society. However, it is essential to strike a balance between regulation and individual freedom, ensuring that adults' rights are respected while protecting the well-being of children.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The notion that a police force carrying guns encourages a higher level of violence in society is a topic of ongoing debate. With the number of criminality increasing rapidly throughout the world, some inhabitants argue that this is a direct result of the police always using guns to solve criminal acts. However, I tend to disagree with this statement, as I believe that other factors contribute to the slight incline in violence levels.While it is true that the presence of guns can escalate situations, the root causes of violence are far more complex. Factors such as socioeconomic conditions, lack of education, and unemployment play a significant role in shaping the crime rate. Moreover, the use of guns by police is often a last resort, and most law enforcement agencies are trained to prioritize de-escalation techniques.It is also worth noting that the relationship between police firearm use and societal violence is not straightforward. In many countries, the introduction of firearms to police forces has been accompanied by a decrease in violent crime rates, as it allows police to respond more effectively to threats. Furthermore, the vast majority of police officers use their firearms responsibly and only when absolutely necessary.In conclusion, while the use of guns by police may contribute to a slight increase in violence, it is by no means the primary cause. The rapid increase in criminality can be attributed to a multitude of factors, and addressing these underlying issues is crucial to reducing violence. Therefore, I disagree with the opinion that the mere presence of guns in a police force is a significant driver of societal violence, and instead advocate for a more nuanced approach to understanding and tackling this complex issue.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";I strongly agree with the statement that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. While parents play a significant role in providing emotional support and guidance, classmates have a profound impact on a child's academic performance and motivation. Classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements, as they create a competitive atmosphere that incents children to strive for excellence.In a classroom setting, children are constantly comparing themselves to their peers, which fosters a sense of competition. This competitive atmosphere motivates children to work harder and aim higher, as they feel the need to keep up with their classmates. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exerts enormous pressure on the children's academic performances. Children are more likely to be influenced by their peers' achievements and strive to surpass them, rather than solely relying on their parents' encouragement.Furthermore, classmates provide a sense of belonging and social support, which is essential for a child's emotional and academic well-being. When children feel connected to their peers, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their schoolwork. In contrast, parents, although well-intentioned, may not always be aware of the nuances of their child's academic life, and may not be able to provide the same level of influence as classmates. In conclusion, the influence of classmates on a child's success in school should not be underestimated. They play a vital role in shaping a child's academic motivation, performance, and overall success.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The notion that living in big cities is detrimental to people's health is a topic of ongoing debate. Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live, drawn by the promise of better job opportunities, entertainment, and cultural experiences. While life in those cities is good in some ways, offering unparalleled convenience and diversity, the downside is that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.One of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before is environmental pollution. The air in big cities is often filled with toxic fumes from vehicles, factories, and construction, leading to respiratory problems and other health issues. Furthermore, the high levels of noise pollution, overcrowding, and stress associated with urban living can also have severe consequences on both physical and mental well-being. The fast-paced and often sedentary lifestyle of city dwellers can lead to a lack of exercise, poor diet, and increased risk of chronic diseases.In addition to pollution, the lack of green spaces and poor waste management in cities exacerbate the problem. The World Health Organization has consistently highlighted the risks associated with urban pollution, emphasizing the need for urgent action to mitigate these effects. Therefore, it can be concluded that while cities offer many benefits, the negative impact on health cannot be ignored. To improve the health and wellbeing of urban residents, governments and individuals must work together to create cleaner, greener, and more sustainable living environments. By investing in pollution reduction strategies and promoting healthy lifestyles, it is possible to make city living healthier and more sustainable for all. Ultimately, the key to a healthy urban lifestyle lies in finding a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of city living.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The notion that a police force carrying guns encourages a higher level of violence in society is a topic of debate among many. Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carry firearms can increase violence in the society, as it may escalate situations and lead to more aggressive behavior. However, I disagree with this statement to a great extent.Most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally, rather than those carried by law enforcement officers. This suggests that the root of the problem lies in the illegal possession and trade of firearms, rather than the legitimate use of guns by police. If a government wants to control crime in a community, it is essential to manage the actions of individuals, particularly those involved in criminal activities, rather than focusing solely on the guns used in violent crimes.Moreover, having a well-equipped and well-trained police force can actually help to reduce violence and maintain law and order. Police officers need to be able to protect themselves and the public from harm, and carrying guns can be a necessary measure to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Rather than encouraging violence, a well-regulated and accountable police force can help to prevent and respond to violent incidents, thereby reducing the overall level of violence in society.In conclusion, while some may argue that police carrying guns contributes to a more violent society, I firmly believe that this is not the case. The focus should be on addressing the underlying causes of violence, such as poverty, lack of education, and illegal activities, rather than restricting the ability of law enforcement officers to carry out their duties effectively. By doing so,
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;The role of education in the development of a country is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, I strongly agree that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Education has the power to transform individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. However, in a developing country, the reality is that not many can afford to send their children to school, which creates a significant barrier to achieving universal education.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers, or engineers. Rather, it means empowering individuals with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking abilities to contribute to their communities and societies in meaningful ways. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgments, which is essential for personal and national growth. Education enables individuals to make informed decisions about their health, finances, and environment, leading to improved overall well-being.Moreover, education has a multiplier effect, where educated individuals can contribute to the development of their communities and countries in various ways. They can participate in the workforce, start businesses, and engage in civic activities, ultimately driving economic growth and social progress. In conclusion, education is indeed the single most important factor in the development of a country. It has the potential to break the cycle of poverty, promote social mobility, and foster sustainable development. Therefore, it is essential for governments, organizations, and individuals to prioritize education and work towards creating a more educated and informed society. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of individuals and nations, leading to a brighter and more prosperous future.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The notion that celebrities are more renowned for their glamour and wealth than their accomplishments, and that this has a negative impact on young people, is a topic of debate. Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented individuals who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. They believe that the constant exposure to these celebrities' extravagant lives can lead to a distorted view of what is truly important in life.However, I disagree with this statement to a certain extent. The young generation these days is very conscious towards positive lifestyles, and they are not easily swayed by superficial fame. They are well-equipped with life skills, such as critical thinking and media literacy, which enable them to distinguish between genuine achievements and superficial glamour. Moreover, not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. Most celebrities have worked hard to hone their craft and have achieved success through their dedication and perseverance.In fact, many celebrities use their platform to promote positive values and raise awareness for social causes, which can have a profoundly positive impact on young people. They can inspire and motivate young individuals to pursue their passions and work towards making a positive difference in the world. Therefore, while it is true that some celebrities may be more famous for their wealth and glamour, I believe that the young generation is capable of making informed decisions and looking beyond the superficial aspects of celebrity culture. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what they want to achieve in life and who they want to look up to as role models.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, with these devices being widely used by people of all ages. However, I believe that this great invention of the 21st century causes many problems in our society. One of the primary concerns is that excessive use of mobile phones can exert an adverse effect on our social skills.Spending too much time on mobile phones can lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining strong relationships. When individuals are constantly glued to their screens, they miss out on opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations, share emotions, and develop empathy. As a result, social skills such as active listening,ing, and conflict resolution are compromised. Moreover, the over-reliance on mobile phones can lead to social isolation, where people substitute online connections for in-person interactions, further exacerbating the erosion of social skills.Furthermore, the constant distraction provided by mobile phones can also impede social interactions. When people are together, yet each is engrossed in their own screen, the quality of interaction is significantly diminished. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and loneliness, even in the presence of others. Therefore, I agree that mobile phones can destroy social interaction if not used judiciously. It is crucial for individuals to strike a balance between their use of mobile phones and engagement in face-to-face interactions to mitigate the adverse effects on social skills. By being mindful of our mobile phone use, we can harness the benefits of this technology while preserving the essence of human connection.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The environment problems facing today's world are undoubtedly severe and multifaceted. There is a viewpoint that the government and large companies should assume the responsibility to protect the environment, leaving ordinary citizens with little to no role to play in mitigating these issues. This perspective is based on the notion that solving some environmental problems requires large budgets and various technologies, which are typically beyond the capabilities of individual citizens.It is true that addressing environmental concerns such as pollution, deforestation, and climate change often necessitates significant financial investment and advanced technological solutions. For instance, the development and implementation of renewable energy sources, as an alternative to fossil fuels, requires substantial funding and complex technological infrastructure. In such cases, the role of governments and large corporations is indispensable, as they possess the necessary resources and expertise to undertake these large-scale projects.However, it would be misguided to conclude that ordinary people have no part to play in environmental protection. On the contrary, there are numerous ways in which individuals can contribute to the preservation of the environment. Simple actions such as recycling, using public transport, or reducing personal consumption of plastics can collectively make a significant difference. Furthermore, ordinary people can also benefit directly from environmental improvements, such as cleaner air and water, and more green spaces, which enhance the quality of life and public health.In conclusion, while it is accurate that governments and large companies have a critical responsibility in reducing environmental damage due to their capacity for large-scale action, it is also important to recognize the potential of collective action by ordinary people. By participating in environment-friendly practices and advocating for environmental policies, individuals can make a tangible impact. Therefore, the responsibility for environmental protection should be shared among governments, corporations, and the public, as each sector has a unique role to play in mitigating the environmental challenges of today.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The statement that detailed descriptions of crimes on newspaper and TV should be restricted due to their potential negative consequences on society is a notion that I largely agree with. A great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated, or even fraudulent, which only serves to terrorize communities and leave law-abiding people increasingly apprehensive about crimes. This sensationalism can lead to unnecessary fear and anxiety among the public, which can have detrimental effects on mental health and social cohesion.Moreover, detailed reports of crimes may provide potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. By broadcasting step-by-step accounts of criminal activities, the media may inadvertently create a tutorial for those inclined to engage in similar unlawful behavior. This could lead to an escalation of crime rates, as individuals become more informed and emboldened to commit offenses.Without restrictions on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would likely become more severe and the social harmony would be broken. The media's role in shaping public perception and influencing behavior cannot be overstated. By limiting the amount of graphic and explicit crime coverage, we can prevent the glorification and dissemination of criminal knowledge, ultimately contributing to a safer and more stable society. Therefore, I firmly believe that the media should exercise restraint when reporting on crimes, prioritizing the well-being and security of the community over the pursuit of sensational headlines. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative consequences of crime coverage and foster a more responsible and informed public discourse.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;The notion that teaching children handwriting skills is unnecessary in the modern age has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the proliferation of modern technology has rendered handwriting obsolete, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. In my opinion, I disagree with the idea that handwriting is no longer a vital skill for children to learn.In this age of modern technology, it is easy to assume that digital tools have replaced the need for handwritten work. Despite the convenience offered by up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Handwriting helps children to develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and cognitive abilities. Moreover, research has shown that writing information down by hand improves retention and understanding, making it an essential tool for students to achieve academic success.Furthermore, poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. When teachers are unable to decipher a student's handwriting, it can lead to misinterpretation of their work, resulting in lower grades and a loss of confidence. Additionally, in many subjects, such as mathematics and science, handwriting is still a dominant form of expression, and students who struggle with handwriting may find it challenging to keep up with their peers.In conclusion, while modern technology has certainly changed the way we communicate and access information, I firmly believe that teaching children handwriting skills is still essential. Handwriting is not just a means of communication, but also a tool for learning, retention, and self-expression. By continuing to teach handwriting, we can ensure that children develop the skills they need to succeed academically and personally, and that they do not miss out on the benefits that handwriting has to offer.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The notion that families who send their children to private schools should be exempt from paying taxes that support the state education system is a contentious issue. Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable, as they do not utilize the public education system. They argue that it is unfair to expect them to contribute financially to a system that does not benefit their own children.However, I disagree with this statement to a large extent. While it is true that affluent individuals who send their children to private schools may feel that they are being unfairly taxed, it is essential to recognize the broader societal benefits of a well-funded state education system. By paying taxes, these affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor, as the state education system provides opportunities for disadvantaged students to access quality education. This, in turn, helps to reduce social and economic inequalities.Moreover, if parents of children studying in private schools were to receive a tax reduction, it would lead to a waste of public capital. The state education system relies heavily on taxation to fund its operations, and a reduction in tax revenue would likely result in a decrease in the quality of education provided. This would have far-reaching consequences, including a less educated workforce and a less competitive economy. Therefore, I believe that all citizens, regardless of whether they use the state education system or not, should contribute to its funding through taxes. This ensures that the system remains robust and able to provide quality education to those who need it most.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The statement that government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money has sparked a heated debate. There has been a wide opinion that governments should invest more money in public services rather than arts, citing the essential role that public services play in the daily lives of citizens. In my perspective, however, I disagree that investing in the arts is a waste of money. Instead, I believe that both public services and arts are worthy of investment.Indispensable public services like hospitals and schools are indeed worth every penny invested in them. They provide the basic necessities for a functioning society, ensuring the health, education, and well-being of citizens. Governments have a responsibility to provide these services, and investing in them is crucial for the development and prosperity of a nation. However, this does not mean that investment in the arts should be neglected.The arts, including music and theatre, play a vital role in promoting cultural diversity, creativity, and social cohesion. They provide a platform for self-expression, entertainment, and education, enriching the lives of individuals and communities. Moreover, the arts sector is a significant contributor to the economy, generating revenue and creating jobs. By investing in the arts, governments can support local economies, preserve cultural heritage, and promote national identity.Rather than pitting public services against the arts, I believe that a balanced approach is necessary. Governments should allocate funds to both public services and the arts, recognizing the value that each brings to society. By doing so, they can ensure that citizens have access to quality public services, while also promoting cultural development and creativity. In conclusion, while public services are undoubtedly essential, I firmly believe that investment in the arts is not a waste of money, but rather a vital complement to the investment in public services.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The notion that traditional cultures will inevitably be lost as technology advances is a topic of ongoing debate. While it is true that many old, traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology, I do not entirely agree that the two are mutually exclusive. On the one hand, it is undeniable that the rapid advancement of technology has led to the erosion of traditional cultures. Many ancient practices, customs, and ways of life have been replaced by modern alternatives, leading to a loss of cultural heritage. For instance, the rise of digital communication has led to a decline in the use of traditional languages and dialects, while the increased accessibility of global media has resulted in the homogenization of cultural expression.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. For example, digital archiving and online platforms have enabled the preservation and dissemination of cultural artifacts, music, and literature, making them accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, technology has facilitated the documentation and analysis of traditional practices, allowing researchers to study and understand them in greater depth. Furthermore, social media has provided a platform for cultural exchange and education, enabling people to learn about and appreciate different cultures. In conclusion, while the advancement of technology does pose a threat to traditional cultures, it is not inevitable that the two cannot coexist. With careful consideration and management, technology can be harnessed to support the preservation and promotion of traditional cultures, rather than leading to their demise.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The idea that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject has sparked a heated debate. There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty, with the aim of promoting gender equality and balance. However, I partially disagree with this notion.On one hand, it is undeniable that traditionally, many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education, and arts. This trend is often reflected in the enrollment numbers of various faculties, with male students dominating science and engineering fields, and female students dominating humanities and arts fields. Attempting to enforce equal enrollment numbers in each faculty may limit the freedom of choice for students and stifle their true interests.On the other hand, I believe that universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities. This can be achieved through targeted outreach programs, scholarships, and mentorship initiatives that aim to break down gender stereotypes and promote diversity in various fields. By doing so, universities can foster a more inclusive and dynamic learning environment, where students can explore their passions without being constrained by traditional gender roles.In conclusion, while the idea of equal enrollment numbers in each faculty is well-intentioned, I believe that universities should focus on promoting diversity and inclusivity, rather than enforcing strict quotas. By encouraging students to pursue their interests, regardless of gender, universities can create a more vibrant and equitable learning environment that benefits all students. Ultimately, the goal should be to provide equal opportunities, not equal numbers.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The media's fascination with celebrities has sparked a heated debate about the potential negative effects on children. I strongly agree with the opinion that media coverage of celebrities is having a detrimental impact on young minds. Celebrities, such as movie stars, are often portrayed in the media as living a life of luxury, surrounded by wealth and glamour. They are frequently seen with new romantic partners, exotic vacations, and extravagant possessions, creating an illusion of effortless success.This constant exposure can be misleading for children, who may perceive that celebrities' wealth and fame are achieved without hard work or dedication. As a result, children may develop a flawed understanding of the importance of education and hard work in achieving their own goals. They may believe that studying hard at school is not necessary for a successful career and earning a living, which can lead to a lack of motivation and poor academic performance.Moreover, not all celebrities are positive role models for children. Some engage in questionable behavior, such as substance abuse or reckless relationships, which can be glorified by the media. This can send the wrong message to children, who may emulate their favorite celebrities' behavior without understanding the consequences. Parents and guardians should be aware of the potential negative influence of celebrity culture on children and take steps to promote positive values and role models. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the media's portrayal of celebrities can have a negative impact on children, and it is essential to encourage children to develop a realistic understanding of success and the importance of hard work and education.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The age-old adage ""prevention is better than cure"" holds significant relevance in today's world, where the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. In light of this, it is essential to allocate a substantial portion of the health budget towards health education and preventative measures, rather than solely focusing on treatment. I strongly agree with the statement that a large proportion of the health budget should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures.By investing in health education and preventative measures, governments can empower citizens with the knowledge and tools necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle, thereby reducing the likelihood of illnesses and diseases. This proactive approach can lead to a significant decrease in the burden on healthcare systems, as preventative measures can help mitigate the onset of diseases, reducing the need for costly treatments. Furthermore, health education can promote healthy behaviors, as people become more aware of the risks associated with unhealthy habits, such as smoking and poor diet.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment. This strategic allocation of resources can have a long-term positive impact on the overall health and wellbeing of citizens, ultimately leading to a more sustainable and efficient healthcare system. By prioritizing prevention over treatment, governments can create a healthier, more informed population, which is essential for the prosperity and development of a nation. Therefore, it is crucial that governments reassess their health budgets and prioritize health education and preventative measures to ensure a healthier future for their citizens."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families. The notion that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies, and subsequently raising them, is an outdated concept. While a mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is as vital a part of healthy parenthood as motherhood. The traditional division of labor, where mothers are expected to be the primary caregivers, is no longer applicable in modern society.In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child. Fathers, just like mothers, have a profound impact on their child's emotional, social, and cognitive development. By emphasizing fatherhood as much as motherhood, we can promote a more balanced and equitable distribution of parental responsibilities. This not only benefits the child but also alleviates some of the burden on mothers, allowing them to pursue their own interests and careers.Furthermore, involved fathers can serve as positive role models, teaching children important values such as responsibility, respect, and hard work. By acknowledging and valuing the importance of fatherhood, we can work towards creating a more supportive and inclusive family environment. Ultimately, I believe that emphasizing fatherhood as much as motherhood is essential for promoting healthy and well-rounded child development, and for creating a more balanced and equitable society. By recognizing the vital role that fathers play, we can work towards a more nurturing and supportive environment for all family members.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;"I strongly disagree with the statement that ""time spent playing sport is time wasted"" and that children should solely focus on studying hard at school. Both studying hard and playing sports are essential parts of a child's life, as they provide a well-rounded development of the mind and body.Studying hard at school is undoubtedly crucial, as it equips children with a plethora of knowledge and skills that will benefit them in the future. Through academic pursuits, children develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for their future careers and personal growth. However, it is equally important to recognize the value of playing sports. Engaging in physical activities not only makes children healthier, but also contributes to their overall well-being. Sports help children develop important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance, while also fostering social relationships and a sense of community.Moreover, playing sports has been shown to have a positive impact on children's academic performance, as it improves concentration, memory, and cognitive function. Therefore, rather than being a waste of time, playing sports can actually complement and enhance the learning experience. In conclusion, both studying hard and playing sports are vital components of a child's life, and it is essential to strike a balance between the two. By doing so, children can develop into well-rounded, healthy, and knowledgeable individuals, equipped with the skills and abilities necessary to succeed in all aspects of life."
